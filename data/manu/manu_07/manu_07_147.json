  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who ascends a mountain peak, enters a private chamber in a palace, goes into a secluded forest, or stands in a place free of pebbles—must deliberate upon sacred counsel without being observed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from spatial and temporal seclusion that enables undisturbed cognition.",
    "Causation arises through intentional withdrawal from external influence for internal clarity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes the ability to access寂静思维 conducive to dharma-discernment.",
    "Restoration logic requires the individual to reclaim inner sovereignty before societal reintegration.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when deliberation happens beyond sensory distraction and social projection."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse mandates that final judicial discernment must occur within environments designed for absolute confidentiality and minimal perceptual disturbance. The threshold of responsibility lies not merely in legal knowledge but in the capacity to withdraw from collective opinion and align with pure consciousness during judgment formation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that correct insight emerges only under conditions of complete seclusion. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that such insight manifests sequentially after eliminating all external projections.

The non-punitive reality rule affirms that no corrective force operates except the natural consequence of misjudging due to environmental impurity.",
