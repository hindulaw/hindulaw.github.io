  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that judicial discernment must penetrate beyond explicit acts to latent intentions. The threshold of responsibility includes awareness of concealed motives. Authority is hierarchically assigned to those capable of perceiving unspoken agendas. Restoration supersedes punitive measures when insight reveals misaligned consciousness rather than malicious will.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here is pratyakṣa-jñāna—direct perception of concealed intent. Anupūrvaśaḥ applies as intent precedes act, thus requiring sequential recognition from subtle to gross. Proportional responsibility arises from capacity to recognize而非 judge. Non-punitive reality rule holds because unseen intent, once revealed, calls for consciousness restoration, not punitive consequence.",
