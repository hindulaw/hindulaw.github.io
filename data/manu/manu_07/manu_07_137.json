  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्किं चिदपि वर्षस्य दापयेत्करसंज्ञितम् ।\nव्यवहारेण जीवन्तं राजा राष्ट्रे पृथग्जनम् ॥ ७.१३७॥",
  "transliteration": "yatkiṃ cidapi varṣasya dāpayetkarasaṃjñitam |\nvyavahāreṇa jīvantaṃ rājā rāṣṭre pṛthakjanam || 7.137||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever tax or levy is designated for a year, the King shall cause it to be collected from the people living within the realm through established administrative conduct.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's capacity to sustain societal order through lawful exaction.",
    "Causation arises from the alignment of individual participation with collective welfare.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns fiscal duty according to means and benefit received.",
    "Restoration logic ensures that revenue collection supports dharmic governance and social harmony.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when subjects recognize their role in sustaining national integrity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a fiscal period is declared AND a levy is assigned by lawful decree THEN the sovereign system MUST execute collection procedures aligned with existing economic capacities.",
    "IF any subject resides within jurisdiction AND derives benefit from state protection THEN proportional contribution via taxation IS binding.",
    "IF revenue collection disrupts individual or familial sustenance THEN adjustment protocols MUST activate automatically to restore balance without punitive recourse.",
    "IF administrative process fails to maintain transparency THEN systemic correction MUST occur through internal realignment rather than external penalty."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes the threshold of sovereign authority over fiscal policy while mandating alignment with dharmic capacity assessment. The court must ensure that revenue mechanisms reflect both constitutional validity and consciousness-based equity, prioritizing restoration of societal equilibrium over coercive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that taxation flows from mutual obligation between ruler and ruled. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates that fiscal structures emerge sequentially from foundational dharmic agreements. Proportional responsibility aligns with individual capacity and benefit derived. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that misalignment in payment stems from systemic gaps, not personal fault; thus correction proceeds through completion, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate automatic review of taxpayer capacity upon default detection.",
    "Engage completion process where unpaid dues are renegotiated based on current ability.",
    "Assign civic education modules to enhance understanding of reciprocal duties.",
    "Reintegrate defaulter into contributory framework through adjusted payment plans ensuring no loss of dignity or livelihood."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Taxation functions as an instrument of collective upliftment under sovereign guidance. Justice operates exclusively through restoration, never punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter of truth, harmony, and right action."
