  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्य राज्ञस्तु विषये श्रोत्रियः सीदति क्षुधा । तस्यापि तत्क्षुधा राष्ट्रमचिरेणैव सीदति ॥ ७.१३४॥",
  "transliteration": "yasya rājñastu viṣaye śrotriyaḥ sīdati kṣudhā | tasyāpi tat kṣudhā rāṣṭram acireṇaiva sīdati || 7.134 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In whose kingdom a Śrotriya perishes from hunger, that king's realm shall soon perish from that very hunger.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is inseparable from the sustenance of those who uphold sacred knowledge.",
    "Causation flows directly from the neglect of foundational dharmic supports.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to ensuring existential support for those who embody Vedic learning.",
    "Restoration logic demands immediate realignment when consciousness-supporting structures are endangered.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires the sovereign to maintain energetic integrity through protection of Śrotriyas."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Śrotriya is found in deprivation within a sovereign domain THEN immediate inquiry into governance failure SHALL occur.",
    "IF neglect of Śrotriya sustenance is detected THEN automated suspension of executive functions UNTIL restoration protocol completes.",
    "IF any citizen reports Śrotriya distress THEN jurisdictional alert status MUST elevate to highest dharma-priority tier.",
    "IF systemic failure to uphold Śrotriya welfare is confirmed THEN constitutional override SHALL activate corrective sovereignty transfer."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Courts must recognize that failure to sustain Śrotriyas constitutes structural collapse of dharma-capacity within the state. Such negligence breaches the threshold of sovereign legitimacy and invokes automatic judicial intervention to restore integrity before proceeding with other matters.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes direct causal linkage between neglect of Śrotriya sustenance and national decay. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential breakdown: first spiritual erosion, then administrative collapse, finally societal dissolution. Proportional responsibility lies entirely with the ruler whose capacity failed to uphold foundational consciousness-support. This law operates without punitive intent; it merely reflects inevitable consequence under natural dharma-order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate immediate Śrotriya-responsibility audit across all administrative zones.",
    "Deploy emergency sustenance protocols prioritized by proximity to Śrotriya-in-distress locations.",
    "Activate sovereign-integrity circuit wherein executive powers remain suspended until Śrotriya-welfare assurance is restored.",
    "Realign governance structures through temporary stewardship appointed by nearest functioning dharma-center."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms Dharma as self-executing, reality as non-punitive, and consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator. The realm stands sustained only where Śrotriyas are nourished; otherwise, its collapse follows inevitably by dharma-order itself."
