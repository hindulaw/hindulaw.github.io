  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The messenger of the king is praised who is attached in service, pure, capable, remembering duties, knowing place and time, embodied with presence, free from fear, and eloquent.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that truthful representation emerges only when the messenger embodies presence and clarity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that distortion occurs when fear or impurity enters transmission. Responsibility aligns proportionally with inner capacity.
