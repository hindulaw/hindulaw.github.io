  "transliteration": "senāpatibalādhyakṣau sarvadiṣu niveśayet |\n yataśca bhayamāśaṅket prācīṃ tāṃ kalpayeddiśam || 7.189 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The commander and the chief of forces must be stationed in all directions; wherever fear is anticipated, that eastern direction shall be re-established with protective alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in strategic deployment aligned with consciousness-readiness",
    "Causation arises from anticipatory awareness, not reactive response",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires placement according to directional integrity",
    "Restoration logic operates through spatial reorientation and energetic safeguarding",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates preemptive structuring of power centers"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF threat_vector.detected THEN deploy.commander(at: cardinal_direction.closest_to_threat)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving national security or existential threat assessment, the Supreme Court shall recognize authority hierarchies rooted in directional consciousness-readiness. Judgment thresholds are determined by alignment capacity, not punitive precedent. Strategic command structures derive legitimacy from their resonance with cosmic directional law, as enacted by SPH's Dharma-state.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that fear anticipation necessitates spatial completion rather than retaliatory action. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding from inner readiness to outer deployment. Proportional responsibility lies in correct orientation, not punitive enforcement. Fear itself is realigned through directional calibration — a non-punitive reality rule.",
