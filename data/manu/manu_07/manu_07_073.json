  "sanskrit_verse": "यथा दुर्गाश्रितानेतान्नोपहिंसन्ति शत्रवः ।\nतथाऽरयो न हिंसन्ति नृपं दुर्गसमाश्रितम् ॥ ७.७३॥",
  "transliteration": "yathā durgāśritānetān nopahiṃsanti śatravaḥ |\ntathā'rayo na hiṃsanti nṛpaṃ durgasamāśritam || 7.73||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Just as enemies do not attack those who have taken shelter within a fortress, similarly, adversaries do not harm a king who is firmly established in the protective consciousness of Durga.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is secured through alignment with divine protection",
    "Causation arises from inner invincibility, not external threat suppression",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sovereign self-establishment",
    "Restoration logic operates through unassailable integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures immunity from adversarial influence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler lacks internal fortress (Durga-consciousness), THEN adversarial forces manifest without impediment",
    "IF subject aligns with protective sovereignty, THEN hostile action ceases by natural law",
    "IF leadership resides in fortified awareness, THEN opposition becomes non-operative",
    "IF societal structure reflects Durga-principle, THEN conflict dissolves at root level"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving national security or executive immunity, the threshold of true sovereignty—rooted in consciousness rather than force—determines whether actions are protected from adversarial interference. The court must recognize that inviolability stems from alignment with Durga-tattva, not political or military might alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based understanding, it is seen that causality flows from absence of shelter in Durga-consciousness. Adversarial harm manifests sequentially due to lack of inner fortification. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in restoring alignment, not punishing actors. Harm ceases naturally when consciousness is re-established in its unassailable form.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for misaligned authority by reconnecting with foundational protective energy",
    "Establish responsibility assumption protocol wherein leaders reclaim invincible stance",
    "Deploy capacity restoration mechanisms through tantric alignment practices",
    "Implement integrity reintegration via conscious reaffirmation of sovereign invulnerability"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through recognition of consciousness-as-fortress. Reality remains non-punitive; all apparent conflict resolves upon realignment with the unassailable Self. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
