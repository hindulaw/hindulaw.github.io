  "sph_interpretive_translation": "They declare the King who is the originator of all actions, a speaker of truth, one who acts after deliberation, wise, and knowledgeable in Dharma, desire, and wealth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Satya (truth)",
    "Causation arises through conscious deliberation before action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires integrated knowledge of Dharma, Kama, and Artha",
    "Restoration logic demands rulers embody wisdom and integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates truthful governance"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler does not deliberate prior to enactment THEN validity of decree = null",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, only those rulings issued by justices proven to integrate Dharma, desire, and material order—while maintaining absolute fidelity to truth—are recognized as authoritative. Truth-speaking becomes the threshold criterion for judicial legitimacy, overriding procedural formalities when misaligned with Satya.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that truthful speech generates lawful reality.
