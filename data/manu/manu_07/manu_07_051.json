  "sanskrit_verse": "दण्डस्य पातनं चैव वाक्पारुष्यार्थदूषणे ।\nक्रोधजेऽपि गणे विद्यात्कष्टमेतत्त्रिकं सदा ॥ ७.५१॥",
  "transliteration": "daṇḍasya pātanaṁ caiva vāk-pāruṣyārtha-dūṣaṇe |\nkrodhaje'pi gaṇe vidyāt kaṣṭam etat trikaṁ sadā || 7.51||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In matters involving the fall of authority, verbal harshness, and distortion of meaning, even when arising from anger, one must always recognize these three as a severe category demanding immediate restoration of dharma through consciousness realignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is not diminished by external aggression but by internal misalignment.",
    "Verbal violence disrupts the causal field of communication and must be corrected at the level of intention.",
    "Distortion of meaning creates false realities that require pramāṇa-based restoration.",
    "Anger-induced acts are not exempt from responsibility; they reveal capacity gaps in self-governance.",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes behavioral correction and determines true accountability."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act involves daṇḍa-pātana (fall of lawful authority), THEN initiate integrity reintegration protocol for the responsible party.",
    "IF speech contains vāk-pāruṣya (verbal harshness), THEN deploy causal purification process to restore clarity of expression.",
    "IF artha-dūṣaṇa (meaning distortion) occurs, THEN execute pramāṇa-realignment sequence to reconstruct accurate understanding.",
    "IF action originates from krodha (anger), THEN apply capacity-restoration mechanism to prevent recurrence.",
    "IF any of the above conditions co-occur, THEN escalate to trika-severity completion process without punitive overlay."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that all three categories—fall of authority, verbal abuse, and meaning distortion—are to be addressed through consciousness-based adjudication rather than punitive measures. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent alone but in the measurable disruption caused to the dharmic field. Authority hierarchies are preserved through restorative enforcement, not punitive sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with Nyaya through its emphasis on pramāṇa (valid means of knowledge) and anupūrvaśaḥ (sequential manifestation). It recognizes that anger-generated actions follow a causal chain rooted in consciousness disorder. Responsibility is proportional to capacity, and correction focuses on restoring alignment rather than inflicting consequence. There is no punitive reality rule here—only a call for conscious reintegration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate daṇḍa-sthāpana (authority reinstatement) protocol for affected parties.",
    "Deploy śabda-śuddhi (speech purification) mechanism to neutralize harmful vibrations.",
    "Execute artha-pratipūraṇa (meaning reconstruction) process using authoritative pramāṇas.",
    "Apply krodha-nirodha (anger cessation) technique via breath-body-mind integration.",
    "Engage trika-saṁśodhana (threefold cleansing) procedure to restore holistic balance."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam is the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores order through consciousness realignment, rejects punitive frameworks, and affirms that justice flows from the integrity of Being, not the consequences of doing. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
