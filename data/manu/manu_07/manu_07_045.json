  "sanskrit_verse": "दश कामसमुत्थानि तथाऽष्टौ क्रोधजानि च ।\nव्यसनानि दुर्ऽन्तानि प्रयत्नेन विवर्जयेत् ॥ ७.४५॥",
  "transliteration": "daśa kāmasamutthāni tathāṣṭau krodhajāni ca |\nvyasanāni durantāni prayatnena vivarjayet || 7.45 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Ten vyasanas arise from desire; eight more originate in anger—these boundless afflictions must be consciously abandoned through determined effort.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from self-mastery, not coercion",
    "Causation is traced to unregulated impulses within consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition and withdrawal from destructive patterns",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious disidentification from compulsive tendencies",
    "Consciousness alignment arises by abandoning lower-frequency emotional states"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent exhibits behavior traceable to unchecked kama-vyasana OR krodha-vyasana THEN initiate capacity-restoration protocol",
    "WHEN ten desire-born vyasanas OR eight anger-born vyasanas are detected IN PATTERN THEN assign completion process for reintegration",
    "IF a societal disruption originates from identified vyasanic impulse THEN deploy consciousness-alignment mechanism而非 punitive intervention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that actions rooted in uncontrollable impulses (kama/krodha) must not be judged solely by outcome, but by the presence or absence of conscious withdrawal. The threshold of responsibility lies in whether the individual engaged in prayatna (effort) to abandon the vyasana.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering-inducing behaviors emerge sequentially from internal imbalance (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility aligns with awareness and effort applied to withdraw from compulsive drives. Retribution has no place where causality is traced to unmastered consciousness rather than malicious intent.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vyasanabandha Completion Process to restore energetic integrity",
    "Assign Karmic Pattern Recognition Module to identify recurring impulse loops",
    "Deploy Samvit Sthiti Reestablishment Protocol to realign consciousness with discriminative awareness",
    "Activate Prayatna Reinforcement Mechanism to support sustained behavioral transformation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It reflects the eternal Dharma as originally cognized by the Avataric Intelligence. Justice here serves only restoration, never punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through the evolution of consciousness."
