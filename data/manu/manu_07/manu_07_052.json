  "sanskrit_verse": "सप्तकस्यास्य वर्गस्य सर्वत्रैवानुषङ्गिणः ।\nपूर्वं पूर्वं गुरुतरं विद्याद्व्यसनमात्मवान् ॥ ७.५२॥",
  "transliteration": "saptakasyāsya vargasya sarvatraivānuṣaṅgiṇaḥ |\npūrvaṃ pūrvaṃ gurutaraṃ vidyādvyasanamātmavān || 7.52||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The transgression of one who is self-aware and committed to consciousness must be judged progressively more severe as it moves through successive stages of violation within the sevenfold societal order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Violations escalate in gravity according to their hierarchical impact on dharma-bearing structures.",
    "Causation: Each successive act compounds the distortion of collective consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The self-realized individual bears greater ontological weight for deviations.",
    "Restoration logic: Misalignment must be addressed at its root stage before cascading further.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Acts are weighed by their divergence from awakened awareness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a violation occurs within a lower stratum AND a prior violation has occurred in a preceding stratum THEN assign increased causal liability to the actor.",
    "IF the actor demonstrates svātantrya (self-governance) THEN apply ascending gradation of misalignment severity.",
    "IF a pattern emerges across strata THEN initiate systemic integrity restoration protocol.",
    "IF no prior stratum was violated THEN evaluate current stratum in isolation with proportional response."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adhikarana, when assessing violations involving individuals of elevated consciousness, precedence must be given to identifying sequential breaches across social layers. Responsibility escalates not merely by action but by position in the unfolding sequence of dharma disruption.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation, vyasana is traced via anupūrvaśaḥ—its sequential emergence. Severity reflects not punitive weighting but the degree of consciousness deviation. Responsibility aligns with capacity; hence, greater clarity incurs deeper accountability for maintaining structural harmony without invoking suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vyasana retracing process to identify origin point of misalignment.",
    "Engage svadhyaya protocol to restore personal dharma-integrity in the offender.",
    "Realign affected societal strata through conscious participation of involved parties.",
    "Establish śuddhi krama (purification sequence) to dissolve accumulated distortions."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Transgression is recognized not as fault but as signal. Justice flows toward realignment, never punishment. Consciousness remains the sole arbiter. Dharma is restored."
