  "sanskrit_verse": "इन्द्रानिलयमार्काणामग्नेश्च वरुणस्य च ।\nचन्द्रवित्तेशयोश्चैव मात्रा निर्हृत्य शाश्वतीः ॥ ७.४॥",
  "transliteration": "indrānilayamārkāṇām agneśca varuṇasya ca |\ncandravitteśayoścaiva mātrā nirhṛtya śāśvatīḥ || 7.4||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The eternal measures of Indra, Air, Sun, Fire, Varuna, Moon, and Wealth—these foundational capacities—are to be restored in their pure measure by removing distortion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as capacity inherent in cosmic order",
    "Causation through alignment with foundational energies",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in natural function",
    "Restoration logic based on re-establishing original measure",
    "Consciousness alignment through harmonization with elemental forces"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a societal disruption occurs THEN identify the foundational energy (Indra, Vayu, Surya, Agni, Varuna, Chandra, Kubera) whose measure has been distorted",
    "IF distortion is detected THEN initiate restoration protocol aligned with that energy's original function",
    "IF individual or collective action misaligns with elemental capacity THEN activate consciousness realignment through completion process",
    "IF governance fails to uphold elemental balance THEN enforce reintegration through dharmic authority hierarchy"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes the threshold of responsibility at the level of energetic alignment. When constitutional or societal order falters, the court must assess which foundational cosmic force—such as leadership (Indra), communication (Vayu), clarity (Surya), transformation (Agni), justice (Varuna), emotion (Chandra), or wealth (Kubera)—has lost its true measure. Judgment must proceed not by punitive measures but by recalibrating societal structures to restore those elemental balances.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through recognition of the disrupted elemental flow; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential misalignment from individual to societal levels; proportional responsibility lies in restoring the correct measure without blame; the non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction arises naturally when consciousness aligns with dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate elemental capacity audit to determine deviation from śāśvatīḥ mātrāḥ",
    "Assign completion processes corresponding to each disturbed energy field",
    "Realign institutional functions with respective foundational capacities",
    "Activate community-wide consciousness restoration through ritualized integration practices",
    "Establish ongoing monitoring via yogic insight and dharmic metrics rather than punitive surveillance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. The eternal measures are restored. Justice flows from alignment, not punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
