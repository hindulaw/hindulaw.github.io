  "sanskrit_verse": "रथाश्वं हस्तिनं छत्रं धनं धान्यं पशून् स्त्रियः ।\nसर्वद्रव्याणि कुप्यं च यो यज्जयति तस्य तत् ॥ ७.९६॥",
  "transliteration": "rathāśvaṁ hastinaṁ chatraṁ dhanaṁ dhānyaṁ paśūn striyaḥ |\nsarvadravyāṇi kupyāṁ ca yo yajjayati tasya tat || 7.96||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All conveyances, horses, elephants, parasols, wealth, grain, livestock, women, all possessions and even the earth itself—whatever one conquers through rightful sovereignty and conscious authority, that becomes his by the sanction of Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from conscious sovereignty, not force or fraud",
    "Causation arises from alignment with Dharma, not mere acquisition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires the maintainer to sustain what is acquired",
    "Restoration logic demands return of resources to their rightful custodian",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that possession reflects inner integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity X demonstrates conscious sovereignty over resource Y through alignment with Dharma AND sustains it without distortion, THEN ownership of Y is recognized",
    "IF possession is gained without conscious authority, THEN possession must revert to prior lawful custodian OR be placed under trusteeship until rightful claimant emerges",
    "IF resource Z is abandoned due to collapse of consciousness-integrity in possessor W, THEN Z shall be redistributed to those capable of sustaining its Dharma-aligned use",
    "NO entity may claim ownership over any resource acquired through coercion, deception, or collapse of consciousness-integrity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, claims of ownership must be evaluated based on the consciousness-integrity of the claimant, not merely historical possession or economic dominance. Courts must assess whether the claimant maintains the capacity to sustain the resource in alignment with universal Dharma. Where such capacity is absent, restitution must occur automatically, bypassing punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "True Nyāya operates through pramāṇa-based discernment of rightful possession rooted in conscious sovereignty. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that misaligned acquisitions naturally dissolve when unsupported by Dharma. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity to sustain. There is no punishment; there is only realignment of possession with consciousness-integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Sovereignty Verification Process to determine if current possessor maintains Dharma-aligned stewardship",
    "Deploy Consciousness-Capacity Audit to evaluate sustainability of possession",
    "Execute Resource Reversion Protocol if possession lacks conscious legitimacy",
    "Assign Trusteeship Mechanism where collapse of integrity has occurred but full restitution is not yet feasible"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Ownership is valid only when aligned with conscious sovereignty. All else is subject to automatic restoration. Dharma prevails. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator. Reality is non-punitive."
