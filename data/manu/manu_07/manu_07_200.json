  "transliteration": "trayāṇām apy upāyānāṁ pūrvoktānām asambhave |\ntathā yudhyeta sampanno vijayeta ripūn yathā || 7.200||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the three previously described means of resolution have proven impossible, a realized being engages in battle in such a way as to completely vanquish enemies.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from existential capacity, not institutional position",
    "Causation is determined by sequential alignment with dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility precedes action",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of unresolved dharmic sequence",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the legitimacy of engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF all prior restorative measures are ontologically exhausted AND conflict remains unresolved THEN authorized entity MAY engage in corrective confrontation",
    "IF actor demonstrates sampanna (integrated consciousness) THEN engagement MUST align with total resolution, not partial deterrence",
    "IF resolution pathway is blocked at all three levels (negotiation, mediation, arbitration) THEN direct confrontation becomes lawful",
    "IF enemy state persists beyond dialogue THEN victory must restore dharma, not inflict punitive damage"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when constitutional remedies, judicial mediation, and legislative reconciliation fail, the State retains lawful authority to act decisively. The threshold of responsibility is measured not by aggression but by completeness of prior attempts. Authority is validated through demonstrated alignment with dharma, ensuring that final action restores integrity rather than enforces punishment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that conflict arises only after dharmic pathways are fully obstructed. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that war is the final sequential stage, not first resort. Proportional responsibility lies with those who exhaust peaceful means before acting. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that victory aims at dissolution of opposition, not degradation of adversary.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verification that all three prior dharmic methods have been genuinely attempted and documented",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Commander must demonstrate personal alignment with total resolution",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Ensuring combatants operate from integrated consciousness, not reactive impulse",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Post-conflict actions must restore societal harmony without residual hostility"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through lawful engagement when peaceful means are exhausted. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the supreme adjudicator."
