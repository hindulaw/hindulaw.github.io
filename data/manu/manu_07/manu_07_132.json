  "transliteration": "patraśākatṛṇānāṃ ca carmaṇāṃ vaidalasya ca | mṛnmayānāṃ ca bhāṇḍānāṃ sarvasyāśmamayasya ca || 7.132 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Ownership and liability extend to all material produced or possessed, whether organic—such as leaves, vegetables, grass—or processed materials including leather, clay vessels, and stone implements.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority over material production establishes proportional responsibility for its use and misuse.",
    "Causation arises through conscious engagement with material forms, not abstract ownership.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by control, access, and intentionality in relation to substances.",
    "Restoration logic requires reintegration of misused resources into dharmic alignment without punitive consequence.",
    "Consciousness alignment governs the lawful relationship between beings and material phenomena."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being exercises dominion over any organic or manufactured substance, THEN that being assumes full restorative liability for its effects.",
    "IF misuse of material results in distortion of dharma, THEN corrective action shall align with the causal capacity of the responsible agent.",
    "WHEN multiple agents interact with a shared resource, responsibility shall be apportioned according to conscious intent and operational control.",
    "ALL material liabilities must resolve via completion protocols ensuring no residual karmic distortion remains."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes threshold responsibility based on actual or potential influence over matter. The court must assess not just possession but also the capacity to direct or alter the function of an item. Liability flows from capability, not mere association.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality emerges through intentional interaction. As causality unfolds sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ), so too does responsibility manifest progressively. There is no inherent fault; only misalignment requiring correction. Justice realigns consciousness with truth rather than imposing penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process wherein the responsible party reintegrates distorted material back into functional harmony.",
    "Assign Responsibility Assumption Protocol where the agent acknowledges their role in the distortion and commits to rectification.",
    "Implement Capacity Restoration Measures to ensure future interactions proceed within dharmic parameters.",
    "Enforce Integrity Reintegration Sessions to restore balance between individual consciousness and collective material well-being."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored. Reality operates beyond punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
