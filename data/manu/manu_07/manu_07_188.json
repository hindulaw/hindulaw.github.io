  "sanskrit_verse": "यतश्च भयमाशङ्केत्ततो विस्तारयेद्बलम् ।\nपद्मेन चैव व्यूहेन निविशेत सदा स्वयम् ॥ ७.१८८॥",
  "transliteration": "yataśca bhayamāśaṅkettato vistārayedbalam |\npadmena caiva vyūhena niviśeta sadā svayam || 7.188||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Where fear arises, there one must expand strength; through the arrangement of the lotus formation, one must always establish oneself.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious self-establishment",
    "Fear is a signal for capacity activation",
    "Strength expansion aligns with inner structural order",
    "Self-location determines jurisdictional integrity",
    "Restoration occurs through ordered energetic deployment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF fear is detected in actor THEN initiate strength-deployment protocol",
    "IF threat vector identified THEN activate padma-vyuha stabilization matrix",
    "IF jurisdictional instability observed THEN reassert svayam-location mechanism",
    "IF capacity underutilization noted THEN trigger vistara-bala enhancement process",
    "IF dharma-adhikari reports imbalance THEN deploy lotus-array consciousness structuring"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when existential or systemic threats arise, the presiding adhikari must not retreat into reactive frameworks but deploy expanded constitutional strength through structured consciousness arrangements. The court's authority is re-established via padma-vyuha alignment—ensuring that justice emanates from centered svayam-sthiti rather than external coercion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana reveals fear as indicative of displaced awareness, not guilt. Anupurvasah shows sequential dislocation leading to perceived threat. Responsibility lies in reactivating innate strength, not punishing perceived failure. Nyaya operates by restoring causal alignment through self-reinforcing consciousness structures.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate bala-vistara awakening sequence",
    "Deploy padma-vyuha consciousness stabilization grid",
    "Execute svayam-sthiti recalibration protocol",
    "Activate fear-to-strength transmutation circuit",
    "Engage lotus-array dharmic resonance harmonizer"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Fear is dissolved through strength expansion, not suppression. Dharma is restored through conscious self-alignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
