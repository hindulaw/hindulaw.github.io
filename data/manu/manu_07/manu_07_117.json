  "transliteration": "viṃśatīśastu tatsarvaṃ śateśāya nivedayet |\nśaṃsedgrāmaśateśastu sahasrapataye svayam || 7.117||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has collected twenty units shall report all of it to the collector of hundreds; the collector of village-hundreds himself reports to the lord of thousand.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows hierarchically through proportional capacity",
    "Causation is maintained through conscious reporting chains",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with administrative scope",
    "Restoration logic operates via transparent accountability structures",
    "Consciousness alignment requires integrity in fiscal stewardship"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a collector governs 20 units THEN all collections MUST be reported to the next-tier authority governing 100 units",
    "IF a collector governs 100 village-units THEN direct reporting obligation EXISTS to the regional authority of 1000 units",
    "NO deviation in reporting chain IS permitted under ANY circumstance",
    "ALL financial movements MUST follow hierarchical transparency protocols",
    "AUTHORITY SCALE determines REPORTING STRUCTURE and INTEGRITY REQUIREMENT"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes immutable vertical accountability within governance. It defines that no local collector may bypass intermediate oversight, ensuring systemic transparency. The threshold of responsibility correlates directly with scale of authority, and failure to uphold this chain constitutes a violation of dharma-adhikara itself.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that misalignment in fiscal reporting disrupts cosmic-administrative harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of consequences as disintegrated consciousness rather than punitive suffering. Proportional responsibility aligns with capacity escalation—higher authority bears greater burden of rectification. Non-punitive reality rule upholds that correction arises naturally from violated alignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establishment of accurate reporting flow through supervised realignment",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Higher authority assumes corrective duty without blame assignment",
    "Capacity Restoration: Training and attunement for lower authorities to restore integrity",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public acknowledgment and ceremonial reaffirmation of lawful alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through conscious fiscal alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
