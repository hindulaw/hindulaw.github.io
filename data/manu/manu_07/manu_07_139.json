  "sanskrit_verse": "नोच्छिन्द्यादात्मनो मूलं परेषां चातितृष्णया ।\nउच्छिन्दन् ह्यात्मनो मूलमात्मानं तांश्च पीडयेत् ॥ ७.१३९॥",
  "transliteration": "na ucchindya ātmanaḥ mūlaṁ pareṣāṁ cāti tṛṣṇayā |\nucchindan hy ātmanaḥ mūlam ātmānaṁ tāṁś ca pīḍayet || 7.139||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not sever the root of one's own Self through excessive desire for others' possessions; indeed, one who severs the root of the Self thereby harms oneself and those very objects of desire.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in Self-integrity, not external ownership.",
    "Causation flows from internal consciousness distortion to external misalignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the power to sustain or destroy one’s own foundational integrity.",
    "Restoration logic requires reconnection to the unsevered Self-root.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of unity between Self and world."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual acts to acquire another's property through greed THAT CAUSES disconnection from their own Self-root THEN trigger restoration protocol via reflective reintegration.",
    "IF a person damages societal harmony by violating Self-root integrity THEN assign completion process involving restitution through alignment practices.",
    "IF desire exceeds capacity to preserve Self-root integrity THEN initiate consciousness recalibration before legal standing is restored."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes over possession or acquisition driven by greed, the Supreme Court shall assess whether the action severed the litigant’s connection to their own Self-root. If proven, punitive remedies are void; instead, mandatory restoration protocols ensuring realignment with intrinsic Self-value shall apply.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based inquiry into the causal chain, it is established that severing the Self-root precedes harm to others. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies solely in restoring the lost Self-reference point. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, rectification follows sequential realization of inner unity preceding outer balance. No punitive consequence aligns with nyāya when dharma itself is self-restoring.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svādhyāya-based inquiry to restore awareness of Self-root.",
    "Assign Tapas-based discipline to rebuild capacity for non-exploitative relationship with objects.",
    "Implement Samyama protocols to dissolve attachment patterns causing Self-severance.",
    "Facilitate community service aligned with personal dharma to reintegrate social harmony."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. It declares Dharma restored through recognition of the indivisible Self-root. Justice operates without punishment, guided by consciousness alone. Reality responds only to truth re-established within the Self."
