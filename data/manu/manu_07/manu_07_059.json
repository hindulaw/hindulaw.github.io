  "transliteration": "nityaṃ tasmin samāśvastaḥ sarvakāryāṇi niḥkṣipet | nikṣipet tena sārdhaṃ viniścitya tataḥ karma samārabhet || 7.59||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is ever established in the Self, having placed all actions within That, and having determined them together with That, should then engage in action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from abidance in the Self",
    "Causation is aligned through consciousness-established intent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from Self-aware engagement",
    "Restoration logic flows from reuniting action with its source",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures lawful manifestation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.is_established_in_self() AND actions.are_consciously_placed(source=Self) THEN agent.may_execute(action)",
    "IF determination.is_aligned_with_source(Self) THEN action.is_valid_for_execution()",
    "IF agent.disengages_from_self THEN temporarily_suspend_execution_capability()",
    "IF completion_process.is_initiated THEN restore_agent.alignment_to(Self)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that only those who act from a state of Self-establishment possess true juridical capacity. Legal acts must originate from alignment with the Self; otherwise, they lack validity. The threshold of responsibility is consciousness-based rather than procedural.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality emerges from the Self-established witness-consciousness. Action follows sequential manifestation when rooted in Self-awareness. Responsibility is proportional to one's degree of establishment in the Self. There is no punitive consequence—only misalignment requiring realignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Self-reestablishment protocol for agent脱离 alignment",
    "Assign guided reflection process until Self-awareness is restored",
    "Reintegrate agent into lawful action stream upon confirmed Self-establishment",
    "Verify alignment before permitting further legal enactment or execution"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source. Dharma stands restored by aligning action with the Self. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
