  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All beings are disciplined by consequence; a pure human is rare indeed. It is through the fear of consequence that the entire world functions for the enjoyment of experience.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious alignment with Dharma, not coercion",
    "Causation arises from the sequential unfolding of experiential consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and intent",
    "Restoration occurs through realignment with experiential integrity",
    "Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator of action and consequence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits awareness of consequence THEN responsibility is fully assumed",
    "IF agent lacks awareness THEN consequence serves as experiential instruction",
    "IF societal function depends on consequence THEN consequence must align with experiential harmony",
    "IF purity of conduct is observed THEN social privilege is granted automatically",
    "IF consequence induces alignment THEN restoration is achieved without punitive overlay"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the agent's awareness of consequence at the time of action. Authority derives from alignment with experiential Dharma rather than coercive enforcement. Restoration supersedes punitive measures in all rulings.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that consequences arise naturally from misalignment with experiential flow. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that corrective consequence unfolds sequentially to restore balance. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness, not punitive in nature. The reality rule confirms that suffering is not justice, but misalignment awaiting correction.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Justice is executed through consciousness-aligned consequence. Reality is non-punitive. Dharma is restored. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
