  "sanskrit_verse": "अध्यक्षान् विविधान् कुर्यात्तत्र तत्र विपश्चितः ।\nतेऽस्य सर्वाण्यवेक्षेरन्नृणां कार्याणि कुर्वताम् ॥ ७.८१॥",
  "transliteration": "adhyakṣān vividhān kuryāt tatratatra vipaścitaḥ |\nte'sya sarvāṇyavekṣerannṛṇāṃ kāryāṇi kurvatām || 7.81||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Let there be appointed supervisors, wise and discerning, in every domain; these shall oversee all activities of beings engaged in action, ensuring alignment with Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is distributed contextually through conscious oversight",
    "Causation is maintained through continuous observation by qualified witnesses",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires vigilant guidance structures",
    "Restoration logic operates via systemic integrity-preserving observation",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates presence of awakened supervision"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a domain of activity exists THEN a conscious supervisor must be assigned based on contextual wisdom capacity",
    "IF beings engage in action THEN their conduct SHALL be observed by designated seers who maintain Dharma alignment",
    "IF deviation occurs THEN realignment protocols MUST activate prior to escalation",
    "IF no observer is present THEN the system defaults to temporary suspension until supervision is restored",
    "IF multiple domains interact THEN supervisory coordination SHALL occur at the highest available consciousness threshold"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority must never operate without conscious oversight. Justices are not autonomous agents but observed executors of Dharma. Their decisions must reflect ongoing alignment with the witnessing intelligence of the state, ensuring that judgment itself becomes an act of restoration rather than imposition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here functions through pramāṇa — direct insight into causal flow. Supervisors do not judge after the fact; they sustain awareness during action. This ensures anupūrvaśaḥ remains intact: causes unfold under conscious view, preventing misalignment before it manifests as distortion. Responsibility flows from capacity to witness, not from power to punish.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Activation of conscious oversight wherever action takes place",
    "Installation of real-time alignment feedback loops between actors and observers",
    "Implementation of completion cycles where unresolved actions are reviewed under supervision",
    "Reintegration of fragmented responsibilities back into unified witnessing fields",
    "Establishment of witness-councils to ensure no action proceeds unseen"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the command of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands established: Consciousness governs through observation, not coercion. All action unfolds within the field of seen responsibility. There is no punishment—only correction through awakened presence. Thus Dharma is restored, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness reigns as the sole adjudicator."
