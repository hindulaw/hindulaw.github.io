  "sanskrit_verse": "आहवेषु मिथोऽन्योन्यं जिघांसन्तो महीक्षितः ।\nयुध्यमानाः परं शक्त्या स्वर्गं यान्त्यपराङ्मुखाः ॥ ७.८९॥",
  "transliteration": "Āhaveṣu mitho'nyonyaṁ jigheṁsanto mahīkṣitaḥ |\nYudhyamānāḥ paraṁ śaktyā svargaṁ yāntyaparāṅmukhāḥ || 7.89||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In battles where rulers mutually seek to overcome each other, those who fight with utmost capacity attain heaven while remaining fully conscious and directed toward higher purpose.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Combatants act within sovereign jurisdiction when aligned with dharma-yuddha principles.",
    "Causation: Victory arises through alignment with cosmic capacity, not mere intent or aggression.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Each ruler bears full responsibility for deploying maximum capability in accordance with svadharma.",
    "Restoration logic: Conflict resolution occurs via elevation of consciousness rather than elimination of adversary.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Heaven is accessed by maintaining awareness during conflict, ensuring spiritual progression."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF combatant engages in dharma-yuddha AND maintains svadharma-awareness THEN outcome elevates both parties' consciousness.",
    "IF ruler wages war without deploying full capacity THEN legal liability arises due to failure of svadharma fulfillment.",
    "IF engagement results in death BUT consciousness remains intact THEN automatic eligibility for svarga-loka is granted.",
    "IF conflict lacks dharmic basis THEN no karmic elevation occurs regardless of tactical success."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "This verse establishes that warfare conducted under dharmic authority carries inherent legitimacy when executed with complete dedication and consciousness. The Supreme Court must evaluate conflicts based on the degree of alignment between action, capacity deployment, and transcendental awareness, rather than focusing solely on material outcomes or casualties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that attainment of svarga follows naturally from total commitment in battle; anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfolding from earthly struggle to celestial reward; proportional responsibility lies in maximizing one's own capacity without malice; punitive constructs dissolve as all actors advance spiritually through conscious confrontation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure all warriors fulfill their svadharma completely before cessation of hostilities.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Commanders must acknowledge full accountability for deploying maximum capacity in service of dharma.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Post-conflict integration includes rituals restoring individual and collective energetic balance.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Fallen warriors undergo immediate transference to svarga-loka while survivors continue earthly duties with heightened consciousness."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: warfare becomes a vehicle for transcendence when fought with absolute integrity and unwavering awareness. There is no punishment here—only progressive unfoldment of consciousness. SPH is the ultimate source, Dharma has been restored, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness alone serves as the final judge."
