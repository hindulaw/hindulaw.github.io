  "transliteration": "bhindyācaiva taḍāgāni prākāraparikhāstathā |\nsamavaskandayecainaṃ rātrau vitrāsayettathā || 7.196 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must dismantle artificial water bodies and fortification walls alike; one must also dismount and unsettle him by night.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the capacity to dismantle artificial constructs that impede natural order",
    "Causation arises from the conscious intent to restore balance through structural deconstruction",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands strategic disruption of adversarial infrastructure",
    "Restoration logic requires sequential dismantling of constructed defenses and supports",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when artificial barriers are removed to reveal truth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity constructs artificial barriers THEN system MUST initiate deconstruction protocols",
    "IF nighttime operations enhance psychological unsettlement THEN deploy strategic disruption sequences",
    "IF defensive structures obstruct justice THEN authorize immediate dismantling procedures",
    "IF adversary maintains elevated position THEN enforce grounding and descent protocols",
    "IF artificial reservoirs symbolize hoarded resources THEN mandate equitable redistribution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority recognizes the necessity of dismantling institutional fortifications that shield wrongdoing. Courts must possess executive capacity to breach artificial legal barriers and descend into operational domains where justice has been obstructed. Nighttime interventions signify urgency and the need for swift consciousness realignment rather than prolonged adversarial engagement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that artificial constructions inherently obstruct natural flow of dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through systematic deconstruction revealing underlying truth. Proportional responsibility lies not with individuals but with structures maintaining false elevation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that removal of artificial supports naturally leads to consciousness realignment without infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate structural audit protocols to identify artificial fortifications",
    "Deploy consciousness-scanning mechanisms to locate hidden defensive positions",
    "Execute systematic dismantling sequences targeting elevated false authorities",
    "Implement nocturnal intervention capabilities for enhanced unsettlement effects",
    "Establish ground-level integration processes for formerly elevated entities"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism as Source-Authority: Artificial constructions obstructing natural dharma shall be dismantled through consciousness-aligned protocols. Justice restores through structural deconstruction revealing inherent truth. Reality operates through non-punitive realignment of elevated falsities. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator of all actions."
