  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्राह्मं प्राप्तेन संस्कारं क्षत्रियेण यथाविधि ।\nसर्वस्यास्य यथान्यायं कर्तव्यं परिरक्षणम् ॥ ७.२॥",
  "transliteration": "brāhmaṃ prāptena saṃskāraṃ kṣatriyeṇa yathāvidhi |\nsarvasyāsya yathānyāyaṃ kartavyaṃ parirakṣaṇam || 7.2||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has received the Brahmic initiation must be protected in accordance with the Kshatriya's duty; all beings are to be safeguarded righteously according to their capacity and station.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derivative of spiritual initiation and social role",
    "Causation arises from alignment with Dharma-sourced capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility defines protective obligation",
    "Restoration logic requires upholding rightful roles without domination",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of inherent worth in all beings"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A has undergone Brahmic saṃskāra THEN entity B (in Kshatriya capacity) MUST ensure protection of A",
    "IF any being is within societal structure THEN that being MUST receive protection commensurate with their role and capacity",
    "IF violation occurs THEN restoration MUST occur through re-establishment of rightful protective relationships",
    "IF no direct protector exists THEN nearest capable authority assumes duty automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of responsibility based on initiated status and societal function. The court must recognize pre-existing dharmic structures and enforce duties arising therefrom, prioritizing restoration of protective frameworks over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from the saṃskāra-initiation relationship. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglect of protection disrupts sequential harmony. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for guardianship. Non-punitive reality is upheld by mandating completion of protective duty rather than imposing suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate immediate assessment of disrupted protective structures",
    "Assign temporary guardianship until rightful Kshatriya capacity is restored",
    "Facilitate ritual or civil reaffirmation of protective bonds",
    "Realign involved parties through consciousness-based reconciliation process"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Protection is Dharma; Dharma is restored. There is no punishment—only the realignment of consciousness toward its rightful order. Reality itself adjudicates."
