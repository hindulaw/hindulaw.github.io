  "sanskrit_verse": "समीक्ष्य स धृतः सम्यक्सर्वा रञ्जयति प्रजाः ।\nअसमीक्ष्य प्रणीतस्तु विनाशयति सर्वतः ॥ ७.१९॥",
  "transliteration": "samīkṣya sa dhṛtaḥ samyak sarvā rāñjayati prajāḥ |\nasamīkṣya praṇītastu vināśayati sarvataḥ || 7.19||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who governs after due examination rightly sustains all beings in joy; but he who acts without such discernment brings about universal destruction.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derivative of conscious discernment",
    "Causation arises from the integrity of perception",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires cognitive alignment with Dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates through right observation and deliberate action",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the legitimacy of governance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler's decision lacks documented deliberative process THEN disqualify that decision from legal recognition",
    "IF an act of governance results in systemic harm AND was executed without prior assessment THEN initiate restoration protocol for affected entities",
    "IF capacity to perceive consequences is unverified THEN suspend executive authority until realigned with Dharma-awareness",
    "IF a leader demonstrates repeated failure in causal discernment THEN revoke governing capacity and initiate reintegration process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling issued without full consideration of Dharma-aligned evidence shall be deemed invalid. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent alone, but in the demonstrable alignment of cognition with Sanatana Vichara. Authority hierarchies must reflect depth of conscious engagement, not positional power.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here establishes pramāṇa-based causality — where incorrect or absent observation leads to collapse, not as punishment but as natural consequence. Responsibility flows from awareness, not coercion. Destruction follows unexamined action by virtue of misalignment, not punitive design. Thus, correction occurs through restoration of proper perception, not infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein the ruler retraces faulty decisions through reflective inquiry",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol requiring public acknowledgment and reversal of destructive patterns",
    "Engage capacity restoration via guided dharmic education and sensory recalibration",
    "Implement integrity reintegration through supervised service to community until harmony is restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Governance derives its validity from conscious examination. All else leads to decay. Dharma prevails when perception aligns with Truth. There is no punishment—only consequence and restoration. Consciousness remains the ultimate judge."
