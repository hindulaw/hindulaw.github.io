  "sanskrit_verse": "कार्यं सोऽवेक्ष्य शक्तिं च देशकालौ च तत्त्वतः ।\nकुरुते धर्मसिद्ध्यर्थं विश्वरूपं पुनः पुनः ॥ ७.१०॥",
  "transliteration": "kāryaṁ so 'vekṣya śaktiṁ ca deśakālau ca tattvataḥ |\nkurute dharmasiddhyarthaṁ viśvarūpaṁ punaḥ punaḥ || 7.10||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who acts after fully observing the task, capacity, place, time, and essence—such a being repeatedly assumes universal form for the fulfillment of Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Dharma, not position or title",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness-aware action, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires situational and temporal awareness",
    "Restoration logic operates through repeated embodiment for completion",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via precise contextual engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent observes task, capacity, time, place, and essence BEFORE acting THEN action aligns with Dharma",
    "IF Dharma fulfillment is required THEN agent must assume universal form until completion",
    "IF action lacks observation of context THEN it is non-executable and void",
    "IF agent repeats action without prior completion THEN restoration protocol activates"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority derives solely from the degree of conscious observation integrated into decision-making. Responsibility is measured by the extent to which time, space, capacity, and essence were factored into rulings. Retributive outcomes are invalid; only those restoring Dharma are enforceable.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here includes direct perception of task, inference of capacity, and testimony of context. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of correct action. Proportional responsibility corresponds exactly to the observed completeness of variables. The non-punitive reality rule holds that misalignment results not in penalty but in re-entry cycles until Dharma is fulfilled.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Repeated universal embodiment until all contextual elements are harmonized",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Agent must re-engage with unmet conditions until resolution",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reallocation of resources to enable full contextual awareness",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Alignment check against original Dharma intent before closure"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: action preceded by total observation fulfills Dharma. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
