  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the ruler perceives an adversary as absolutely superior in strength, then he shall divide his force and accomplish his purpose through strategic completion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is context-responsive and capacity-aware",
    "Causation arises from alignment with situational superiority",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adaptive resource deployment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes strategic completion over conflict escalation",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through intelligent force distribution"

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters where state capacity is exceeded by adversarial influence, the Supreme Court must recognize that authority lies not in dominance but in intelligent division and redirection of resources toward constitutional completion. The threshold of responsibility shifts from punitive enforcement to strategic restoration when imbalance is acknowledged.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from recognition of imbalance, not from reactive dominance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that sequential response must honor capacity limitations. Proportional responsibility aligns with the necessity of division rather than confrontation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that completion supersedes retaliation as the valid measure of justice.",

    "Initiate force bifurcation protocol upon recognition of superior opposition",
    "Assign secondary resource stream to maintain systemic integrity",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse is executed as Dharma. Justice is restored through capacity-aware strategy, not punitive reaction. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
