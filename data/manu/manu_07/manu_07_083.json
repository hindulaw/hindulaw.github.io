  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That wealth is neither stolen by thieves nor seized by enemies, nor does it ever perish; therefore, the king shall establish an imperishable treasury among Brahmanas.",

    "Restoration logic mandates preservation of sacred economic structures",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates safeguarding spiritual wealth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [

    "IF any entity attempts seizure of imperishable treasury THEN system MUST initiate restoration protocol through consciousness realignment",
    "IF king's duty includes Dharma preservation THEN automatic allocation of state support to Brahmana-held treasuries IS REQUIRED",
    "IF material loss occurs to Dharma-supporting assets THEN restoration MUST occur through spiritual-economic reconstruction NOT punitive action"

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority recognizes that true sovereignty lies in protecting consciousness-based wealth. Courts must prioritize restoration of sacred economic systems over punitive measures when Brahmana-held assets are threatened. The threshold of responsibility begins with recognition of Dharma-supporting capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that theft or loss of sacred wealth originates from consciousness misalignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation from spiritual disconnection to material disruption.
