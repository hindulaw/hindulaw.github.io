  "transliteration": "yadi tatrāpi sampaśyeddoṣaṃ saṃśrayakāritam |\nsuyuddhameva tatrāpi nirviśaṅkaḥ samācaret || 7.176||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Even when perceiving harm caused by reliance upon a defective condition, one shall act without hesitation in accordance with rightful engagement.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in alignment with Dharma, not in reaction to defect",
    "Causation is traced to conscious choice, not external attribution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from clarity of action, not fear of consequence",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion, not correction",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes reactive judgment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent perceives systemic defect AND chooses engagement, THEN the validity of action depends on alignment with Dharma, not aversion to cause-effect",
    "IF fear arises due to perceived fault in environment, THEN action must proceed only if rooted in svadharma, without doubt",
    "IF conflict emerges from reliance on flawed conditions, THEN resolution is achieved through conscious reaffirmation of intent, not punitive redressal"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters where structural flaws contribute to harm, the Supreme Court must evaluate not the defect itself but the actor's alignment with svadharma at the moment of decision. Responsibility is determined by capacity for conscious choice, not by causal proximity to error.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that defects arise from prior misalignments; however, response must be governed by sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of dharma-sankalpa. Proportional responsibility lies in the integrity of response, not in assigning blame. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that justice is restoration of consciousness, not infliction of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Facilitate full acknowledgment of context and reaffirmation of dharmic intent",
    "Assume Responsibility Protocol: Guide actor to recognize agency beyond causal conditioning",
    "Restore Capacity: Realign consciousness with svadharma through meditative inquiry and sankalpa-shuddhi",
    "Reintegrate Integrity: Confirm alignment through witnessed declaration and community affirmation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Justice is executed as restoration of Dharma, not imposition of penalty. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
