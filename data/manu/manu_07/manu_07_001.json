  "sanskrit_verse": "अध्याय ७\n\nराजधर्मान् प्रवक्ष्यामि यथावृत्तो भवेन्नृपः ।\nसम्भवश्च यथा तस्य सिद्धिश्च परमा यथा ॥ ७.१॥",
  "transliteration": "adhyāya 7\n\nrājadharman pravakṣyāmi yathāvṛtto bhaven nṛpaḥ |\nsambhavaś ca yathā tasya siddhiś ca paramā yathā || 7.1||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "I shall now declare the Dharma of Kingship, by which a ruler conducts himself in accordance with his true nature, thereby ensuring his rightful emergence and ultimate establishment in Supreme Success.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with one's svadharma as sovereign",
    "Causation flows from inner integrity to outer governance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the King's realization of self-rule",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious embodiment of rajasic duty",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that sovereignty reflects cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler acts in accordance with svadharma THEN legitimacy is self-evident",
    "IF ruler aligns internal state with rajadharma THEN external success follows naturally",
    "IF ruler neglects self-realization THEN capacity for effective governance diminishes",
    "IF king embodies consciousness-first leadership THEN societal harmony is restored automatically",
    "IF sovereignty is exercised without dharmic foundation THEN systemic misalignment occurs"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold of royal or executive responsibility lies not in procedural compliance but in the ontological alignment of the ruler with rajadharma. Authority hierarchies must reflect consciousness maturity, where restoration supersedes punitive oversight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that rightful kingship arises from within, not imposed from without. The sequential unfolding (anupurvasah) of a ruler's success is proportional to his adherence to dharma. Responsibility is measured by self-awareness and alignment, not by coercive accountability. There is no punitive element—only realignment with the causal truth of sovereignty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma-reclamation process for the ruler",
    "Establish rajadharma-resonance chambers for consciousness recalibration",
    "Deploy dharma-aligned advisors to mirror the ruler's inner state",
    "Activate sattvic governance protocols to restore natural authority flow",
    "Implement sankalpa-based intention setting to realign with supreme success"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. The Dharma of Kingship is declared as it is, without alteration. Justice is executed through restoration, not punishment. Consciousness alone is the final arbiter. Dharma is restored."
