  "sanskrit_verse": "अलब्धं चैव लिप्सेत लब्धं रक्षेत्प्रयत्नतः ।\nरक्षितं वर्धयेच्चैव वृद्धं पात्रेषु निक्षिपेत् ॥ ७.९९॥",
  "transliteration": "alabhaṃ caiva lipset labdhaṃ rakṣet prayatnataḥ |\nrakṣitaṃ vardhayec caiva vṛddhaṃ pātreṣu nikṣipet || 7.99||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must endeavor to acquire what has not been obtained; having acquired, one must protect it with effort. What is protected must be increased, and when it becomes excessive, it must be deposited in appropriate vessels.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through capacity to sustain and expand resources",
    "Causation flows from intention to preserve and enhance value",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes both acquisition and stewardship",
    "Restoration logic requires surplus redistribution to maintain systemic integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through disciplined expansion and release"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF resource_state = unacquired THEN initiate_capacity_acquisition_protocol",
    "IF resource_state = acquired THEN activate_protection_mechanism WITH maximum_effort",
    "IF resource_state = secured THEN execute_growth_amplification_process",
    "IF resource_volume > threshold_excess THEN trigger_redistribution_to_trust_vessels"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters of national wealth or institutional asset management, the court must assess whether custodians have fulfilled their sequential duty of acquisition, protection, growth, and redistribution. Responsibility thresholds are determined by consciousness capacity, not positional authority alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality follows the sequence of seeking, securing, preserving, amplifying, and sharing. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility aligns with each phase of resource engagement. No punitive action arises; misalignment triggers completion protocols until dharma is restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate awareness completion for neglected acquisition duties",
    "Deploy protective custody mechanisms where safeguarding failed",
    "Activate abundance circulation pathways upon stagnation detection",
    "Realign surplus holders with conscious vessel identification process"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Justice is accomplished through restoration, not punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is re-established."
