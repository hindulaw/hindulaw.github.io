  "transliteration": "anityo vijayo yasmād dṛśyate yudhyamānayoḥ |\nparājayaśca saṅgrāme tasmādyuddhaṃ vivarjayet || 7.199||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Victory in battle is impermanent, observed between contending parties; defeat also occurs in war. Therefore, one should avoid warfare.",

    "Consciousness alignment requires renunciation of violence as dispute resolution."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF conflict outcome is uncertain AND violence risk exceeds harmonization potential THEN mandatory mediation protocol activates.",
