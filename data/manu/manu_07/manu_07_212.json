  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A ruler must never abandon land that is perpetually secure, yields abundant crops, and fosters livestock growth, even for personal gain or without due consideration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is inseparable from custodianship of sustainable abundance.",
    "Causation arises from alignment with natural productivity and dharmic stewardship.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rulers to prioritize collective welfare over individual interest.",
    "Restoration logic demands preservation of resource-generative environments.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through sustained service to life-supporting ecosystems."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a territory provides consistent agricultural yield AND supports animal husbandry THEN it SHALL NOT be alienated by ruling authority WITHOUT demonstrable public benefit.",
    "IF a ruler divests productive land for private advantage THEN automatic restoration protocol INITIATES reacquisition under state guardianship.",
    "IF land-use policy threatens kshema (security) or sasya-vriddhi (crop prosperity) THEN decision-making capacity of involved officials IS SUSPENDED pending realignment audit."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving national asset allocation or sovereign land transfer, the Supreme Court must apply the threshold test of dharmic sustainability. Rulers bear absolute responsibility for maintaining lands that ensure long-term food security and ecological balance. Decisions made without evaluating these criteria are inherently invalid and subject to immediate reversal.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based assessment, the causal chain linking abandonment of fertile lands to societal instability becomes evident. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of neglect begins with misaligned intent and culminates in economic degradation. Responsibility lies solely in restoring alignment rather than inflicting penalty. Thus, corrective action focuses on reestablishing dharmic governance structures而非 punitive measures.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Land Stewardship Realignment Process to reclaim and restore abandoned or misused fertile territories.",
    "Activate Sovereign Integrity Review to assess motivations behind land dispossession and implement consciousness-realigning interventions for errant authorities.",

  "final_declaration": "This directive flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice operates exclusively through restoration, consciousness alignment, and reintegration. There is no punitive reality—only the awakening of right duty and rightful abundance. Dharma stands restored. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
