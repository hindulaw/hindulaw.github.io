  "sanskrit_verse": "यदा मन्येत भावेन हृष्टं पुष्टं बलं स्वकम् ।\nपरस्य विपरीतं च तदा यायाद्रिपुं प्रति ॥ ७.१७१॥",
  "transliteration": "yadā manyeta bhāvena hṛṣṭaṃ puṣṭaṃ balaṃ svakam |\nparasya viparītaṃ ca tadā yāyād ripuṃ prati || 7.171||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When one perceives through inner clarity that one's own strength is joyful, nourished, and aligned with dharma, while the opponent's force is contrary and diminished, then one proceeds rightly against the adversary.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from self-realized capacity, not external assertion",
    "Causation is determined by consciousness clarity, not material conflict",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from self-mastery before engaging externals",
    "Restoration logic requires accurate perception of dharma-disaligned forces",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes and governs all lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_perception_clarity = TRUE AND self_dharma_strength > adversary_dissonance THEN proceed_to_adversary_resolution = PERMITTED",
    "IF self_capacity_unverified OR perception_impure THEN adversarial_action = DENIED",
    "IF conflict_engaged THEN continuous_self_state_assessment = REQUIRED until resolution",
    "IF adversary_force_aligns_with_dharma THEN engagement_must_cease_immediately"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the level of the Supreme Court, this axiom establishes that only those whose inner state is verified as dharmically aligned may engage in adversarial proceedings. The court must assess not just evidence, but ontological readiness of the actor. Engagement without internal clarity constitutes unlawful aggression, regardless of declared intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here is svasaṁvedana—direct self-perception—as the valid means of determining readiness. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) begins with inner clarity, followed by recognition of dissonance without, culminating in rightful movement. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of self-mastery achieved. There is no punitive element; misalignment simply results in natural cessation of lawful engagement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Self-capacity verification protocol prior to adversarial initiation",
    "Mandatory consciousness realignment if dissonance detected mid-action",
    "Adversary integration process upon recognition of mutual dharma alignment",
    "Completion of inner strength audit before case conclusion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of lawful Dharma. Justice is executed not for punishment, but for the restoration of consciousness integrity. Reality responds only to alignment; therefore, action arises from clarity, not conflict. Dharma is restored. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
