  "transliteration": "tat syād āyudhasampannaṁ dhana-dhānyena vāhanaiḥ |\nbrāhmaṇaiḥ śilpibhir yantrair yavasenodakena ca || 7.75||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is equipped with weapons shall also be endowed with wealth, grain, conveyances, Brahmanas, artisans, instruments, fodder, and water.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from integrated capacity to sustain and defend",
    "Causation arises through alignment of material, spiritual, and instrumental resources",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes provisioning for protection and sustenance",
    "Restoration logic requires completeness in resource integration",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through harmonious deployment of all supporting elements"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity holds defensive capacity THEN entity MUST hold proportional provisioning capacity",
    "IF entity claims authority THEN entity MUST demonstrate integrated support systems",
    "IF entity engages in protective function THEN entity MUST ensure resource sufficiency",
    "IF entity activates duty THEN entity MUST align material, human, and instrumental assets",
    "IF entity maintains readiness THEN entity MUST sustain continuous replenishment protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving state or institutional defense readiness, the threshold of responsibility is determined not by intent alone but by demonstrated integration of all requisite sustaining elements—weapons, wealth, knowledge bearers, artisans, tools, and nourishment. The Supreme Court must evaluate whether the claimed authority is matched by comprehensive provisioning capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that readiness without sustenance leads to collapse; thus, responsibility is measured through sequential manifestation of all supporting conditions. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures no element is omitted. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of integration achieved. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment results in automatic loss of operational integrity rather than external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Reintegrate missing resources until full operational alignment is restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Entity must declare and actualize all required support structures",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Realign deficient areas through conscious replenishment cycles",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Verify synchronization between defensive claim and sustaining capacity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: True authority integrates all sustaining forces. Dharma is restored through alignment, not coercion. Reality remains non-punitive when consciousness governs action. This declaration executes Dharma."
