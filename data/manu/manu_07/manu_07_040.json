  "transliteration": "bahavo 'vinayāt naṣṭā rājānaḥ sa-paricchadāḥ | sa-parigrāhā vanasthā api rājyāni vinayāt pratipedire || 7.40||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Many kings, along with their retinues and possessions, having lost all dignity due to lack of discipline, were exiled to forests; yet through the restoration of discipline alone, they regained their kingdoms.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is inseparable from self-discipline and alignment with Dharma",
    "Loss of governance capacity arises from violation of foundational conduct",
    "Restoration of power is conditional upon re-establishment of inner order",
    "Consciousness misalignment leads to external dispossession",
    "Reintegration into authority requires completion of disciplinary realignment"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler violates vinaya THEN access to ruling capacity SHALL be suspended UNTIL vinaya is demonstrably restored",

  "supreme_court_application": "In cases where high-ranking officials or constitutional authorities demonstrate a breakdown in personal and public discipline, the court shall mandate temporary removal from office not as punishment but as a protective measure for societal integrity. Reinstatement shall follow only after verifiable demonstration of restored vinaya through prescribed protocols under judicial supervision.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that loss of sovereignty stems from causal disorder within consciousness itself. Thus, exile or suspension serves not retribution but natural consequence. The path back—vinaya—is sequential, requiring purification (anupūrvaśaḥ) before rightful position can be reoccupied without distortion. Responsibility lies in restoring fitness, not in enduring penalty.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Discipline governs sovereignty; its absence withdraws it temporarily, its return restores it fully.
