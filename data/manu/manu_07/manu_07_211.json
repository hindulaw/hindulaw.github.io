  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Aryaness is the knowledge of the Purusha, courage in alignment with compassion, constant focus on the highest aim, and the arising of detachment as a natural quality.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness realization, not social position",
    "Causation arises from alignment with Purushic truth, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's awareness of the Self",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to the Purusha principle",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral modification"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates Purusha-recognition THEN assign Aryan-status automatically",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those who demonstrate clear recognition of the Purusha principle are qualified to judge. Legal decisions must reflect alignment with the highest aim and arise from detached discernment. Responsibility is assigned based on consciousness capacity, not positional authority.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that actions stem from Purusha-awareness or its absence. Anupurvasha shows that misalignment manifests sequentially through loss of high aim and detachment. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness capacity.
