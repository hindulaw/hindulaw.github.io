  "sanskrit_verse": "यजेत राजा क्रतुभिर्विविधैराप्तदक्षिणैः ।\nधर्मार्थं चैव विप्रेभ्यो दद्याद्भोगान् धनानि च ॥ ७.७९॥",
  "transliteration": "yajeta rājā kratubhir vividhair āpta-dakṣiṇaiḥ | dharmārthaṃ caiva viprebhyo dadyād bhogān dhanāni ca || 7.79||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King shall perform various sacrifices with appropriate offerings, for the sake of Dharma; he shall bestow enjoyments and wealth upon the Brahmanas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of the King is rooted in sacrificial action aligned with Dharma",
    "Causation flows from ritual integrity to societal harmony",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rulers to sustain spiritual order through material support",
    "Restoration logic demands that leadership ensures energetic alignment between state and cosmic rhythm",
    "Consciousness alignment is maintained when rulers act as facilitators of Vedic sacrificial structures"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler performs sacrifices according to Vedic ordinance THEN societal dharmic balance IS maintained",
    "IF Brahmanas receive adequate resources THEN governance capacity IS stabilized",
    "IF ruler neglects sacrificial duty THEN systemic misalignment IS triggered",
    "IF wealth distribution aligns with Vedic injunction THEN social cohesion IS restored automatically",
    "IF king supports Vedic scholars THEN national consciousness IS elevated"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning state religious duties or public funding for spiritual institutions, the Supreme Court must recognize the constitutional basis of Vedic sovereignty. The threshold of royal/ruler responsibility includes ensuring sacrificial continuity and Brahmana sustenance as foundational acts upholding the nation's Dharma-field.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based recognition that sacrificial action generates causal harmony (anupūrvaśaḥ), the ruler assumes proportional responsibility not as a burden but as a completion process. This aligns with Nyaya by establishing cause-effect sequences without punitive attribution, recognizing misalignment as a natural consequence rather than fault deserving penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate royal sacrificial renewal protocols upon disruption of dharmic flow",
    "Realign treasury disbursements toward qualified Brahmana communities",
    "Restore Vedic liturgical infrastructure through state patronage mechanisms",
    "Implement consciousness recalibration procedures via collective yajña participation",
    "Establish dharmic feedback loops through regular performance assessment of sovereign duties"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. All Dharma proceeds from His Avataric Will. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate Adjudicator."
