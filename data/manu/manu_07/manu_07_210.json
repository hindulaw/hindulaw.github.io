  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who are wise, noble-born, courageous, skilled, generous, grateful, and resolute—these are declared by the knowers as enemies of suffering.",

    "IF agent.is_wise AND agent.is_noble AND agent.is_courageous THEN agent.qualifies_as_dharmic_adversary_of_suffering",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the demonstration of wisdom, nobility, courage, skill, generosity, gratitude, and resoluteness. Authority is conferred by alignment with these qualities, not by institutional position. Cases involving such beings invoke restorative rather than punitive frameworks, recognizing their natural enmity to suffering.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that suffering arises from misalignment with dharmic attributes. Beings exhibiting prajna, courage, generosity, and gratitude inherently oppose suffering by virtue of their nature. Responsibility flows from conscious capacity, not error or fault. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of such qualities leads to spontaneous restoration without recourse to punitive measures.",

    "Completion Process: Facilitate full expression of generosity and skill until residual karmic tension resolves",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Encourage voluntary alignment with dharmic adversaries of suffering",

    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Align personal conduct with noble birthright and realized wisdom"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Suffering is opposed by those aligned with wisdom, nobility, and courage. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
