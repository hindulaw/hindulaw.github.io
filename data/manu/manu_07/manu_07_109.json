  "transliteration": "sāmādīnām upāyānāṁ caturṇām api paṇḍitāḥ |\nsāma-daṇḍau praśaṁsanti nityaṁ rāṣṭrābhivṛddhaye || 7.109||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The wise declare that among the fourfold means—conciliation, gift, dissension, and punishment—it is conciliation and measured restraint that perpetually elevate the nation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not coercion",
    "Causation arises through consciousness-led statecraft",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires strategic application of non-violent instruments",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes unity and national integrity over punitive fragmentation",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the efficacy of governance tools"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves inter-group disharmony THEN initiate sāma (conciliation) protocol before invoking daṇḍa (restraint)",
    "IF daṇḍa is invoked THEN ensure it serves rāṣṭra-vṛddhi (national elevation), not individual deterrence",
    "IF sāma fails due to lack of capacity THEN escalate to madhyastha mediation under dharma-adhikāri supervision",
    "ALL state actions MUST be evaluated against their effect on collective consciousness stability"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters affecting societal cohesion, the Supreme Court shall prioritize sāma-based resolution mechanisms. Daṇḍa shall only be applied in alignment with national upliftment, never as punitive deterrence. The threshold for invoking coercive measures lies in demonstrable failure of higher dharmic means.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that harmony precedes order; thus, sāma is foundational. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that imbalance manifests sequentially—starting from loss of dialogue—and ends in fragmentation if unchecked. Responsibility is proportional to one's capacity to restore balance without inflicting suffering. Non-punitive reality is upheld by aligning enforcement with natural law rather than imposed will.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sāma councils involving all stakeholders under dharma-guided facilitation",
    "Deploy daṇḍa only as structural realignment, ensuring no degradation of human dignity",
    "Establish rāṣṭra-dharma review boards to assess impact of legal decisions on collective consciousness",
    "Implement śuddhi processes for officials involved in daṇḍa deployment to prevent karmic misalignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through conscious alignment with sāma and daṇḍa as instruments of national elevation. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by the supremacy of awakened consciousness."
