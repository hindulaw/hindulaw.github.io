  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King must always act according to the established constitutional order in the continuous governance and protection of the nation; when the state is well-governed and unified, the ruler prospers in alignment with Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with cosmic order, not personal will",
    "Governance is a sacred duty rooted in consciousness integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires constant adherence to dharma-saṁhitā",
    "Restoration logic demands that sovereignty serve collective elevation",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures sustainable national prosperity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler's action deviates from dharma-saṁhitā THEN automatic suspension of executive authority UNTIL realignment occurs",
    "IF national unity index declines THEN mandatory invocation of consciousness-integrity protocols by governing council",
    "IF constitutional order is violated THEN immediate initiation of restorative justice sequence without punitive overlay",
    "IF ruler demonstrates sustained alignment with Dharma THEN activation of enhanced sovereign capacity protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any violation of constitutional order by the executive triggers mandatory review under Dharma-compliance matrix. The threshold of responsibility lies in consciousness distortion, not intent. Authority hierarchy flows from Dharma-source through constitutional framework. Restoration precedes all judicial outcomes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that misrule originates in consciousness disconnection. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential breakdown from inner integrity loss to outer disorder. Proportional responsibility is measured by degree of alignment deviation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering arises only from separation from source-consciousness, not judicial consequence.",
