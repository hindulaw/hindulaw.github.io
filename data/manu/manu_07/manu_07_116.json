  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When village-level disorders arise, the village head shall report them gradually—first to the district overseer, then to the regional commander.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows hierarchically through conscious capacity",
    "Causation is recognized through sequential manifestation of disorder",
    "Responsibility aligns with administrative capacity and jurisdiction",
    "Restoration requires structured escalation based on systemic integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through ordered communication and transparency"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a local disorder arises THEN the immediate authority must document and escalate within 24 hours",
    "IF escalation fails at any level THEN system auto-notifies next-tier consciousness-aligned authority",
    "IF repeated failure in escalation THEN automatic suspension of lower-tier authority until realignment",
    "ALL escalations MUST include root-cause visibility for upstream decision-making",
    "RESPONSIBILITY is assigned only where capacity for restoration exists"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that lower authorities are duty-bound to escalate systemic failures without concealment. The threshold of responsibility lies in accurate reporting and timely transmission of issues upward. Retribution has no place; only restoration through structured awareness is valid.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is upheld through factual reporting. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional response by aligning corrective action with the scale of disorder. Responsibility is tied to capacity, not fault. The system functions on truth-telling rather than blame, preserving dharma through conscious alignment.",

    "Mandatory completion of unreported incidents through guided disclosure",
    "Capacity-building sessions for underperforming local authorities",

    "Automated restoration triggers when human oversight fails"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Disorder is not punished but resolved through structured revelation. Truth restores order. Consciousness governs justice. Dharma prevails."
