  "sanskrit_verse": "तेभ्योऽधिगच्छेद्विनयं विनीतात्माऽपि नित्यशः ।\nविनीतात्मा हि नृपतिर्न विनश्यति कर्हि चित् ॥ ७.३९॥",
  "transliteration": "tebhyo 'dhigacched vinayaṃ vinītātmā 'pi nityaśaḥ | vinītātmā hi nṛpatir na vinaśyati karhi cit || 7.39||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From those who have realized vinaya, one must continually receive instruction; even a ruler who is established in humility never perishes at any time.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from those established in vinaya, not from position alone",
    "Humility is foundational to sustainable governance",
    "Continuous learning and alignment with higher consciousness preserve leadership integrity",
    "Leadership capacity depends on inner refinement, not external power",
    "Restoration of societal harmony requires rulers rooted in self-discipline"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler exhibits lack of vinaya THEN initiate mandatory counsel with realized teachers",
    "IF leader demonstrates arrogance OR disconnection from dharma THEN trigger constitutional review process",
    "ALL leaders MUST undergo periodic vinaya-realignment assessments",
    "IF governance shows signs of decay THEN invoke humility-restoration protocol before escalation",
    "VINAYA-SUBMITTED LEADERSHIP overrides positional authority in all judicial proceedings"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that even the highest executive or judicial officials must remain under the guidance of those established in vinaya. Position does not confer infallibility; continuous receptivity to spiritual wisdom ensures lawful governance. The Court must recognize humility—not rank—as the true seat of legitimate authority.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here aligns with the pramāṇa of direct spiritual realization. As vinaya manifests through conduct and consciousness rather than title, its absence reveals misalignment, not fault. Responsibility lies in restoring receptivity to truth-consciousness, not punishing error. Sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) confirms that pride precedes collapse, thus early correction preserves both individual and state integrity without punitive intervention.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vinaya Receptivity Program for leaders showing signs of ego inflation",
    "Assign regular mentorship with realized beings for all executive and judicial officers",
    "Implement monthly Vinaya Circles where authority figures publicly acknowledge areas of personal refinement",
    "Establish Conscious Governance Review Boards comprising spiritually realized advisors",
    "Conduct annual Vinaya Immersion Retreats for national leadership"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Humility rooted in vinaya sustains sovereignty. Authority derives not from office but from alignment with divine consciousness. Thus Dharma is restored, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness alone adjudicates eternally."
