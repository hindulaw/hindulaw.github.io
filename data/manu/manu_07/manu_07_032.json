  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In one's own realm, justice must be upheld with unwavering integrity; against enemies, firm enforcement is required. With allies, one must remain tactfully sincere; towards the Brahmanas, one must be forgiving and compassionate.",

    "Authority is context-dependent and varies by relational domain",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes a jurisprudential framework where judicial authority modulates its expression based on the relational standing of the parties involved. The threshold of responsibility includes recognition of spiritual hierarchy, with Brahmanas receiving preferential compassion due to their role in sustaining cosmic order. Enforcement mechanisms differ accordingly, privileging restoration over punitive measures while preserving societal Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that misalignment with relational Dharma generates disorder, requiring correction through appropriate behavioral modulation rather than punitive suffering. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that improper conduct unfolds sequentially through distorted relationships, which are corrected via proportional, consciousness-aligned responses. Responsibility is assigned based on capacity and relational proximity, ensuring alignment without recourse to punitive paradigms.",

All enforcement serves reintegration, never punishment. Reality is non-retaliatory; Dharma is eternally restored."
