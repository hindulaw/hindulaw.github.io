  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is offered into the mouth of the Brahmin—who sustains the superior fire-oblation—neither decays, nor wavers, nor perishes at any time; it remains unfallen and unshaken.",

    "Authority as ontological alignment with Agnihotra",
    "Causation through consecrated offering",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in Vedic sustainment",
    "Restoration via alignment with eternal ritual order",
    "Consciousness alignment through sacred ingestion"
  ],

    "IF offering is made to qualified Brahmin THEN decay, disturbance, and dissolution are nullified",

    "IF consciousness aligns with Vedic ritual THEN causal effects are stabilized",
    "IF integrity of Brahminic mouth is preserved THEN legal offerings retain validity",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication concerning spiritual or ritual offerings, the Supreme Court must recognize that offerings made to a Brahmin who sustains the Agnihotra possess inherent immunity from dissolution or invalidation. Responsibility lies in verifying the ontological capacity of the recipient, not in reviewing procedural minutiae.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that truth resides in the sustained fire-oblation. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation through ritual purity.
