  "transliteration": "pramāṇāni ca kurvīta teṣāṃ dharmān yathoditān |\nratnaiś ca pūjayedenam pradhānapuruṣaiḥ saha || 7.203 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must establish valid means of knowledge and enact the corresponding duties precisely as declared; honor such a one with treasures alongside the principal beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from verified pramāṇa (valid means of knowledge)",
    "Causation is established through alignment with declared dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises upon access to pramāṇa",
    "Restoration occurs through honoring those who uphold pramāṇa",
    "Consciousness alignment is ensured by revering truth-bearers"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity has accessed valid pramāṇa THEN it MUST enact corresponding dharmic duties",
    "IF an entity enacts dharmic duties THEN it SHALL be honored proportionally by the community",
    "IF an entity fails to act on known pramāṇa THEN initiate restorative re-engagement protocols",
    "IF an entity supports pramāṇa-based action THEN allocate resources in recognition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined not by intent or outcome alone, but by whether valid pramāṇa was accessible and acknowledged. Authority flows from alignment with revealed truth, not institutional position. Courts must recognize and restore those who have enacted dharma through verified knowledge, ensuring societal reinforcement of pramāṇa-based conduct.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa functions as the sole pramāṇa for establishing causal responsibility. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that neglect of known dharma manifests consequences naturally through disalignment. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of pramāṇa received. There is no punitive imposition—only sequential restoration through reconnection to truth.",
