  "sanskrit_verse": "अलङ्कृतश्च सम्पश्येदायुधीयं पुनर्जनम् ।\nवाहनानि च सर्वाणि शस्त्राण्याभरणानि च ॥ ७.२२२॥",
  "transliteration": "alaṅkṛtaśca sampaśyedāyudhīyaṃ punarjanam |\nvāhanāni ca sarvāṇi śastrāṇyābharaṇāni ca || 7.222||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has been adorned again for battle must observe all vehicles, weapons, and ornaments as instruments of dharma, not of personal assertion or violence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with dharma, not possession of arms",
    "Causation arises from consciousness-context, not material instrumentation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of tools as extensions of duty",
    "Restoration logic demands recontextualization of conflict-tools into dharmic service",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when instruments are divested of egoic intent"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity possesses weapon THEN verify alignment with declared dharmic purpose ELSE deactivate access",
    "IF vehicle or instrument used in conflict THEN evaluate user's consciousness-state ELSE deny operational status",
    "IF ornament or symbol worn THEN assess bearer’s capacity for non-egoic conduct ELSE initiate realignment protocol",
    "IF recurrence of conflict observed THEN mandate re-consecration of all instruments ELSE suspend deployment rights"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving military, law enforcement, or symbolic national instruments, the Supreme Court shall first establish the consciousness context of their use. Instruments must be evaluated not by their potential for force but by the alignment of their wielder with dharma. Authority hierarchies must reflect spiritual readiness, not structural dominance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from the consciousness-context of the wielder. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misuse follows from misalignment, not from the tool itself. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of self-awareness and dharmic clarity. Therefore, correction lies in restoring the instrument to its rightful dharma-field, not in punitive withdrawal.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate ritual reconsecration of all disputed instruments to dissolve egoic charge",
    "Assign guided reflection protocols to users until alignment with dharma is verifiable",
    "Reintegrate tools into community service under witness of awakened authority",
    "Establish daily reaffirmation practices for holders of high-capacity instruments"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse declares that all instruments of conflict are to be governed by consciousness, not command. Dharma is restored through alignment, not suppression. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
