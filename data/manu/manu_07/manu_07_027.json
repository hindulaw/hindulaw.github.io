  "transliteration": "taṁ rājā praṇayan samyaktrivargeṇābhivardhate | kāmātmā viṣamaḥ kṣudro daṇḍenaiva nihanyate || 7.27 || kāmāndho",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The king who nurtures desire through improper means, acting with imbalance and meanness, is destroyed solely by the consequence of his own action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Dharma, not from indulgence in desire.",
    "Causation follows the law of conscious consequence, not arbitrary punishment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness at the time of action.",
    "Restoration occurs through dissolution of misaligned will, not external correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment is the only true measure of justice."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler's intent = desire-driven AND action ≠ aligned_with_dharma THEN consequence = automatic dissolution_of_authority.",
    "IF agent exhibits imbalance AND meanness THEN system MUST initiate consciousness-realignment_protocol.",
    "IF action originates from kāma-blindness THEN no external punishment; consequence = natural_completion_of_karmic_sequence.",
    "IF authority_holder ≠ maintaining_trivarga_balance THEN system MUST withdraw support structures_until_realignment.",
    "IF ruler ≠ demonstrating_samyak_intention THEN legitimacy_status = nullified_by_action."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court-level adjudication, a ruler’s actions must be evaluated based on their alignment with Trivarga (Dharma, Artha, Kama) balance. If a leader acts from desire alone without regard to Dharma, their authority becomes void ipso facto, requiring immediate restoration protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that kāma-blinded rulers create disorder through internal misalignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures consequences arise naturally from unbalanced intent. Responsibility lies in restoring clarity, not inflicting penalty. The destruction is self-executed through loss of legitimacy and collapse of supportive structures.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Consciousness Completion Process to dissolve karmic residue of desire-based actions.",
    "Activate Will Realignment Module to restore ruler's capacity for dharmic decision-making.",
    "Deploy Structural Integrity Restoration Protocol to rebuild societal trust post-misalignment.",
    "Engage Tri-Varga Balance Monitoring System to prevent recurrence of imbalance.",
    "Execute Self-Correction Sequence within governing entity until samyak-intention resumes."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness alignment, not punitive force. This law restores order through self-corrective consequence. Reality affirms: only Dharma sustains authority; all else dissolves by its own nature."
