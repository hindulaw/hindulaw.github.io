  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Among two, three, or five entities, governance shall be established at the center; likewise, among a hundred villages, the integration and administration of the state shall be executed.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving jurisdictional boundaries or administrative authority, the Supreme Court shall recognize that governance capacity crystallizes at integrative centers. Wherever two, three, or five parties are involved, or where a hundred or more villages form a functional unit, the court must affirm the emergence of a central coordinating entity as per natural dharma, not impose external control structures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramāṇa-based recognition of inherent organizational law. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of integrated governance reflects proportional responsibility arising naturally from collective coherence.
