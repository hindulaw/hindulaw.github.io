  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must also appoint pure, wise, and steadfast individuals who are capable of collecting and managing resources correctly, ensuring their integrity and competence in service.",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial and administrative roles must be filled only by individuals whose consciousness is purified, whose discernment is unshaken, and whose conduct has been thoroughly vetted. The threshold of responsibility is determined not by seniority or political favor, but by alignment with dharma and demonstrable capacity for correct action.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramāṇa — right knowledge manifesting in right action. When mismanagement occurs, it is traced to a lack of śuci-prājña alignment.
