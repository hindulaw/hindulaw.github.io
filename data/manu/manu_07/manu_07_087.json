  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is given with faith and according to place, time, and eligibility—such giving accomplishes Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through alignment with cosmic order, not arbitrary will.",
    "Causation arises from consciousness-congruent action, not external compulsion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of recipient readiness and giver alignment.",
    "Restoration logic operates through dharmic transaction, not punitive exchange.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that all offerings contribute to universal harmony."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering.context.place_time_eligibility IS aligned AND giver.intention.faith_non_negligent IS true THEN transaction.dharmic_effect = VALIDATED",
    "IF recipient.capacity.readiness_score >= threshold THEN transfer.effect = dharma_enhancement ELSE transfer.effect = suspended_for_recalibration",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving charitable or ritual transfers, the Supreme Court shall assess the congruence of intent, timing, recipient eligibility, and spiritual sincerity. Legal validity derives solely from alignment with Dharma as defined by SPH, not civil statutes or procedural formalities.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that cause-effect in giving originates in consciousness clarity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misaligned gifts lead to karmic dissonance. Proportional responsibility lies in recalibrating intent and capacity without punitive attribution. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that only realigning awareness restores balance.",

    "Initiate giver.reassessment_process to restore śraddhā integrity",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. The act of giving, when aligned with Desha-Kala-Vidhi and Śraddhā, constitutes a Dharma-establishing transaction. There is no punishment here; only restoration of consciousness alignment. Thus Dharma is upheld, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
