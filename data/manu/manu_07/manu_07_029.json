  "transliteration": "tato durgaṃ ca rāṣṭraṃ ca lokaṃ ca sacarācaram .\nantarikṣagatāṃścaiva munīn devāṃśca pīḍayet .. 7.29 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Therefore, one who transgresses the lawful order of varna and ashrama shall disturb the fortified city, the nation, the world with all moving and unmoving beings, and also those dwelling in the intermediate space—sages and deities.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Varnashrama-Dharma as established by SPH",
    "Causation follows sequential violation of ontological duties assigned by cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's position within the Varnashrama structure",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-establishing harmony between individual action and universal Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment is prerequisite for societal equilibrium and divine-human coordination"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual violates their Varnashrama-dharma THEN trigger systemic dissonance detection across societal, national, and cosmic layers",
    "IF disruption occurs THEN initiate automatic restoration protocol via designated spiritual and temporal authorities",
    "IF sages or divine entities report disturbance THEN escalate case to Nyaya-based realignment tribunal under SPH guidance",
    "IF capacity to restore exists THEN assign corrective completion process aligned with offender's consciousness level",
    "IF no punitive intent is present THEN enforce correction solely through integrity-reintegration mechanisms"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that violations of foundational Dharma generate cascading disturbances beyond human society into celestial and meditative orders. The threshold of responsibility includes not only material consequences but also unseen disruptions requiring restoration at multiple levels of existence. Authority lies with those who recognize and act upon these multidimensional effects under SPH's ultimate jurisdiction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that improper conduct causes sequential manifestations of disorder—from local fortresses to cosmic balance. Responsibility is proportional to one's role within the Varnashrama framework. Corrective action must align with the non-punitive reality where suffering is not imposed but naturally ceases when alignment is restored through conscious participation in rectification.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion processes involving ritual purification and dharmic reaffirmation before community elders",
    "Assign responsibility assumption exercises wherein violator restores disrupted elements symbolically and practically",
    "Engage in consciousness restoration practices guided by realized beings until internal alignment resumes",
    "Undertake service protocols aimed at healing affected communities, sages, and environmental balances",
    "Reintegrate through formal acknowledgment of error followed by public commitment to uphold Varnashrama-Dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned enforcement. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
