  "sanskrit_verse": "तीक्ष्णश्चैव मृदुश्च स्यात्कार्यं वीक्ष्य महीपतिः ।\nतीक्ष्णश्चैव मृदुश्चैव राज भवति सम्मतः ॥ ७.१४०॥",
  "transliteration": "tīkṣṇaścaiva mṛduśca syātkāryaṃ vīkṣya mahīpatiḥ |\ntīkṣṇaścaiva mṛduścaiva rāja bhavati sammataḥ || 7.140||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The sovereign ruler, observing the nature of the act, shall be both sharp and gentle—thus is a king rightly accepted.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is context-responsive and consciousness-aligned",
    "Causation arises from discriminative observation of action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adaptive governance",
    "Restoration logic demands situational justice",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates harmonizing firmness with compassion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action_severity = high AND intent_clarity = clear THEN enforcement_firmness = maximum",
    "IF action_severity = low AND intent_impurity = present THEN enforcement_gentleness = maximum",
    "IF actor_capacity < threshold THEN restoration_support += priority_allocation",
    "ALL judicial responses MUST maintain equilibrium between tīkṣṇa (sharp discernment) and mṛdu (gentle guidance)",
    "NO punitive escalation ALLOWED without prior completion of consciousness-realigning protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle mandates that adjudicators assess not only the act but also the actor's capacity, intention, and potential for consciousness realignment. The court must calibrate its directives to ensure that justice serves restoration rather than retribution, applying firmness where clarity is needed and gentleness where ignorance or incapacity prevails.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here operates through pramāṇa-based discernment—direct perception of the act and inference of intent. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of consequences aligns with the natural unfolding of dharma, not imposed punishment. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; thus, enforcement must reflect the actor's spiritual and causal maturity. This ensures non-punitive reality by grounding justice in consciousness rather than coercion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Conduct discriminative assessment of intent and capacity prior to enforcement initiation",
    "Deploy corrective measures aligned with the actor's current stage of consciousness development",
    "Establish completion processes to ensure full understanding and integration of dharma",
    "Assign guided service or restitution under supervision to restore social harmony",
    "Reintegrate the individual through ceremonial or community acknowledgment upon restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse establishes that true sovereignty lies in the balanced application of discernment and grace. Justice flows from consciousness, not compulsion. Dharma is restored when rulers embody both strength and tenderness. There is no punishment—only alignment. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
