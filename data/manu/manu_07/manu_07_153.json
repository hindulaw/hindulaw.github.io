  "transliteration": "dūtasampreṣaṇaṃ caiva kāryaśeṣaṃ tathaiva ca |\nantaḥpurapracāraṃ ca praṇidhīnāṃ ca ceṣṭitam || 7.153||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The dispatch of envoys, the completion of unfinished duties, the movement within inner chambers, and the conduct of spies—these constitute the operational framework for sovereign intelligence and administrative continuity under Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the capacity to sustain governance through lawful delegation.",
    "Causation arises from intentional coordination of agents aligned with Dharma.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to all actors engaged in statecraft.",
    "Restoration logic ensures uninterrupted flow of sovereign function.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires transparency and integrity in covert operations."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a sovereign agent performs dūtasampreṣaṇa THEN that action is recognized as an extension of sovereign will.",
    "IF kāryaśeṣa remains unaddressed THEN designated authority must initiate completion protocols.",
    "IF antaḥpura access occurs without śuddhi alignment THEN realignment procedures shall activate.",
    "IF praṇidhī engages in ceṣṭitam THEN continuous pramāṇa validation must accompany their activity.",
    "ALL operational acts must maintain nyāya-compliant causality and consciousness alignment."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes the threshold for recognizing lawful statecraft actions. Responsibility lies not in punitive oversight but in verifying alignment with Dharma-based intent. Covert activities are permissible when embedded within śuddhi-validated structures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that dūta and praṇidhī derive authority from svadharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how incomplete tasks disrupt cosmic order. Proportional responsibility aligns with the purity of motive. Non-punitive reality holds that misaligned actions naturally decay unless reintegrated through śuddhi.",

    "Initiate śuddhi-based realignment for compromised operational channels.",
    "Deploy pramāṇa auditors to verify kāryaśeṣa completion status.",
