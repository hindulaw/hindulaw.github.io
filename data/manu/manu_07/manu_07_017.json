  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King alone is the embodied authority of Danda; he is the leader, the governor, and the protector of the Dharma of the four Ashramas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is centralized in the sovereign executor of Dharma",
    "Causation flows from the King's alignment with Sanatana Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to preservation of societal ashrama-dharma",

  "supreme_court_application": "Only a sovereign whose consciousness is fully established in Dharma may adjudicate at the highest level.
