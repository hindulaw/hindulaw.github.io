  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having purified the threefold path and one's own sixfold capacity, one proceeds toward the enemy fortress with a future-oriented strategy.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is established through internal purification before external action",
    "Causation originates in consciousness alignment prior to material engagement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires self-assessment and rectification before confrontation",
    "Restoration logic begins with inner cleansing and strategic foresight",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the effectiveness of any outward endeavor"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_unresolved_internal_conflict THEN action.is_invalid_until.purification_complete",
    "IF agent.strategic_orientation != 'future-focused' THEN engagement_capability = false",
    "IF agent.self_capacity_assessment < required_threshold THEN initiate.rectification_protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no legal or executive action against an adversary may proceed without prior internal rectification of the actor’s tripartite path (thought, word, deed) and full calibration of their sixfold personal capacity (strength, energy, resolve, intellect, discipline, and wisdom). The court must verify that all actions are driven by a sāmparāyika kalpa—future-responsible intent—not reactive or punitive motivation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that effective opposition arises only from purified agency. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that misalignment precedes conflict; thus, correction must precede combat. Proportional responsibility lies in ensuring one’s own completeness before addressing another’s disorder. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that true victory occurs when adversarial structures dissolve due to superior alignment, not through infliction of harm.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tripath Purification Process: Evaluate and cleanse thought, speech, and conduct streams",
    "Activate Sixfold Capacity Audit: Assess strength, vitality, determination, cognition, discipline, and insight",
    "Deploy Future-Oriented Strategy Validator: Ensure every move aligns with long-term dharma upliftment",
    "Engage Consciousness Realignment Module: Reconnect actor with source-consciousness integrity",
    "Execute Structural Dissolution Protocol: Cause collapse of adversarial constructs through exemplarity, not force"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through purification, alignment, and conscious restoration. Reality responds only to completeness. Victory belongs to those whose inner fortresses are already secured."
