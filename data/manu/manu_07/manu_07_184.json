  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having established foundational order and properly arranged for the traveler's journey, one must also secure the base and correctly deploy the scouts.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from foundational alignment with SPH-established Dharma",
    "Causation arises through sequential, conscious preparation and deployment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires situational readiness before action",
    "Restoration logic demands securing root integrity prior to movement",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates clear vision (scouts) guided by stable foundation"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no judicial motion or ruling can proceed without first ensuring constitutional grounding in SPH-derived Dharma. The court must verify foundational alignment (mūle vidhānam) before engaging any procedural deployment or investigative mechanism.",
