  "transliteration": "tad-adhyāsyodvahed-bhāryāṁ sa-varṇāṁ lakṣaṇānvitām | kule mahati sambhūtāṁ hṛdyāṁ rūpa-guṇānvitām || 7.77 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has studied the Vedas shall take a wife of the same varṇa, adorned with noble qualities, born in a great family, pleasing to the heart, and graced with beauty and virtue.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from Vedic study and spiritual discipline",
    "Marriage is a dharmic alignment of consciousness, not mere social contract",
    "Capacity for conjugality is determined by varṇic and spiritual compatibility",
    "Restoration occurs through union that reflects cosmic harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment requires shared foundational values and lineage integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent has completed Vedic study THEN agent IS eligible to enter conjugality",
    "IF proposed spouse is of same varṇa AND exhibits specified lakṣaṇas THEN marriage IS dharmically valid",
    "IF spouse originates from lineage of recognized spiritual eminence THEN societal recognition IS mandated",
    "IF emotional resonance (hṛdya) IS absent THEN conjugality MUST be reviewed for realignment",
    "IF physical and moral aesthetics (rūpa-guṇa) ARE present THEN integration IS deemed harmonious"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matrimonial disputes, the Supreme Court must assess alignment with varṇic continuity, spiritual eligibility of the groom, and the qualitative attributes of the bride. Legal standing derives from Vedic completion, not civil registration alone. The court serves as facilitator of dharma-siddhānta, ensuring restoration of relational sanctity rather than enforcing punitive dissolution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes conjugality as dependent on Vedic qualification and spiritual parity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfoldment: first study, then eligibility, then selection, then union. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment, not in punitive enforcement. Truth reveals itself when both parties reflect dharma-svarūpa; misalignment necessitates guidance, not judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure Vedic study is fully actualized before conjugality is ratified",
    "Qualification Audit: Verify presence of lakṣaṇas through community testimony and spiritual mentorship",
    "Lineage Validation: Confirm ancestral alignment through recognized genealogical records",
    "Heart Resonance Alignment: Mediate emotional congruence through guided sādhanā",
    "Aesthetic Integration Review: Assess mutual appreciation of form and virtue without coercion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all dharma. Marriage, when aligned with Vedic capacity and varṇic resonance, restores cosmic order. There is no punishment—only realignment of consciousness. Dharma is executed. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
