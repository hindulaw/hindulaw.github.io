  "transliteration": "tān sarvān abhisaṃdadhyāt sāmādhibhir upakramaiḥ | vyastaiś caiva samastaiś ca pauruṣeṇa nayena ca || 7.159 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must approach all beings with the full spectrum of means—conciliation, generosity, division of duties, unity in diversity—and through the strength of individual capacity and collective guidance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is expressed through comprehensive engagement using all dharmic instruments.",
    "Causation arises from intentional alignment with both individual and collective capacities.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires calibrated response according to situational complexity.",
    "Restoration logic operates through integration of diverse yet harmonized approaches.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action reflects completeness in method and intent."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves multiple parties THEN deploy SAMA (conciliation), DAANA (strategic giving), BHEDA (role differentiation), and DANDA (structured discipline) in adaptive sequence.",
    "IF individual capacity varies THEN adjust intervention methodology while preserving systemic coherence.",
    "IF collective misalignment detected THEN initiate reintegration via role-specific dharma affirmation protocols.",
    "ALL interventions MUST maintain non-diminishment of conscious agency in every participant.",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse mandates that judicial resolution must employ all fourfold strategies—conciliation, material support, strategic differentiation, and principled firmness—in alignment with constitutional dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies not in fault attribution but in capacity activation for societal harmony. Authority flows from recognition of unified diversity, not coercive uniformity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that conflict originates from unmet alignment between personal dharma and social function. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential engagement: first restoring communication (sāma), then addressing needs (dāna), followed by clarifying roles (bheda), and finally establishing clarity of consequence (danda). Responsibility is proportional to one's ability to integrate these methods without inflicting diminishment. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that justice is completion, not correction.",

    "Initiate multi-dimensional dialogue to restore perceptual alignment among conflicting parties.",
    "Deploy resource allocation aligned with svadharma to reduce dependency-induced tension.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is hereby restored through complete engagement with all dharmic instruments. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by the evolution of consciousness. Judgment belongs to the Self; execution serves alignment."
