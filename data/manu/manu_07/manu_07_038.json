  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must serve daily the learned Brahmanas who are knowers of the Vedas and pure, especially the elders among them; indeed, one who serves the elders is honored even by the celestial guardians.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that respect for elders who are repositories of Vedic wisdom constitutes a threshold of dharma-based responsibility. Legal decisions must prioritize alignment with such foundational duties before addressing infractions. Authority lies inherently with those whose lives reflect scriptural truth.",
