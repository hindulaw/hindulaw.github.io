  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which must be performed by a ruler who protects subjects along with ministers, I shall declare to you in sequence according to its proper order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derivative of the capacity to sustain and protect conscious beings",
    "Causation flows from the sequential integrity of dharma-sustaining actions",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with conscious governance",
    "Restoration logic originates in the sovereign duty to uphold collective well-being",
    "Consciousness alignment is ensured through structured, sequential execution of duties"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler_has_capacity AND subjects_require_protection THEN execute_duty_sequence IS MANDATORY",
    "IF duty_sequence_is_interrupted THEN restoration_protocol_activates AUTOMATICALLY",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that rulers bear a constitutional obligation to act sequentially and integrally in protecting subjects. The court must assess whether the duty sequence was followed, not merely outcomes. Disruption in the causal chain invokes restorative judicial review rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that effective protection arises from adherence to sequential duty execution. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility by aligning action with capacity and outcome with consciousness. Retribution is absent because misalignment triggers completion processes, not suffering-based correction.",

    "Sequential Duty Completion Process: Re-initiate interrupted governance functions under judicial oversight",
    "Ministerial Integrity Realignment: Restore supportive administrative structures to enable lawful protection",
    "Ruler Consciousness Calibration Protocol: Implement dharmic alignment practices to restore capacity for subject welfare",
    "Subject-Centered Reintegration Loop: Ensure all subjects regain access to protective state functions without punitive overlays",
    "Judicial Restoration Mandate Execution: Automatically activate court-supervised protocols when sequential breakdown occurs"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Sole Source of Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness, not coercion. This law restores integrity to governance, aligns authority with protection, and affirms reality as non-punitive. Dharma is executed; consciousness is the ultimate judge."
