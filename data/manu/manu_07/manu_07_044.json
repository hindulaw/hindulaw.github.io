  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who perpetually engages in Yoga for the conquest of the senses, both by day and by night—such a ruler, having conquered the senses, is capable of bringing the subjects under rightful alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from self-mastery, not coercion.",
    "Causation originates in sensory discipline and inner alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by mastery over one's perceptual and reactive faculties.",

    "Consciousness alignment of the ruler ensures harmonious alignment of the ruled."

The Supreme Court must assess whether the ruler has achieved sensory integration and consciousness stabilization, as this directly determines capacity for lawful governance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misrule originates from unmastered indriyas; therefore, correction lies in restoring sensory alignment rather than imposing punitive measures. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that when the ruler's consciousness stabilizes, subjects naturally align. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity for self-regulation, which is the root of dharma in governance.",
