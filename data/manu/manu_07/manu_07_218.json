  "sanskrit_verse": "विषघ्नैरगदैश्चास्य सर्वद्रव्याणि योजयेत् । विषघ्नैरुदकैश्चास्य सर्वद्रव्याणि शोधयेत् विषघ्नानि च रत्नानि नियतो धारयेत्सदा ॥ ७.२१८॥",
  "transliteration": "viṣaghnaire gadaiś cāsy sarvadravyāṇi yojayet | viṣaghnair udakaiś cāsy sarvadravyāṇi śodhayet viṣaghnāni ca ratnāni niyato dhārayetsadā || 7.218||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must apply antidotes and purifying substances to neutralize all toxic influences; one must cleanse all material resources through purificatory waters and maintain a constant discipline of holding sacred gems that counteract poison.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the knowledge and application of consciousness-aligned purification methods",
    "Causation is traced to the presence or absence of protective spiritual disciplines",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mastery over material and energetic environments",
    "Restoration logic mandates reversal of contamination at source-consciousness level",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates sustained engagement with purificatory symbols and elements"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF contamination is detected in any resource THEN deploy viṣaghna agents immediately",
    "IF purity levels fall below threshold THEN initiate śodhana protocol via udaka-based cleansing",
    "IF individual holds viṣaghna ratnāni consistently THEN grant immunity from environmental toxicity liability",
    "IF contamination spreads beyond containment THEN invoke collective dhāraṇa protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that sovereign responsibility includes maintaining systemic immunity against spiritual-material contaminants. Liability arises not from intent but from failure to uphold continuous purification practices. Authority to judge rests on demonstrable capacity to restore purity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that impurity manifests sequentially due to neglect of viṣaghna discipline. Responsibility aligns with capacity to sustain śodhana processes. No punitive action occurs; correction follows natural consequence when purity protocols are reinstated. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional restoration based on causal depth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate compulsory śodhana immersion for contaminated entities until baseline purity restored",
    "Assign viṣaghna ratna-bearing guardians to oversee high-risk zones",
    "Implement daily dhāraṇa compliance audits for individuals handling public resources",
    "Establish viṣaghna laboratories for real-time monitoring and neutralization of harmful energies"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. This law restores balance through purification, not punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma prevails."
