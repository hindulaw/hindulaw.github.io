  "sanskrit_verse": "एषोऽनुपस्कृतः प्रोक्तो योधधर्मः सनातनः ।\nअस्माद्धर्मान्न च्यवेत क्षत्रियो घ्नन् रणे रिपून् ॥ ७.९८॥",
  "transliteration": "eṣo'nupaskṛtaḥ prokto yodhadharmaḥ sanātanaḥ |\nasmād dharmān na cyaveta kṣatriyo ghnann raṇe ripūn || 7.98||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This eternal law of the warrior, declared in its purest form, binds the Kshatriya who destroys enemies in battle to never fall away from Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation is determined by consciousness-state at time of action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires fulfillment of svadharma without deviation",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-alignment with source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external behavioral evaluation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor_is_kshatriya AND engaged_in_battle_against_enemies THEN adherence_to_yodhadharma_must_be_verified_through_consciousness_state_assessment",
    "IF dharma_compliance_confirmed THEN no_fall_from_duty_occurs ELSE initiate_restorative_reintegration_protocol",
    "IF action_derives_from_svatantrya_of_dharma THEN exempt_from_post_action_retrospective_judgment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, a Kshatriya's battlefield conduct must be evaluated solely against the parametric integrity of Yodhadharma as sourced in Sanatana Vakya. Retrospective moral or secular frameworks hold no jurisdiction. The threshold of responsibility lies exclusively in the unbroken continuity of Dharma-consciousness maintained during engagement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the Kshatriya’s lawful engagement arises from śabda-pramāṇa of Sanatana Dharma, not individual will. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation of duty-bound action rooted in cosmic order. Proportional responsibility aligns with preservation of ṛta, not infliction of consequence. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that true justice restores alignment rather than assigns fault.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadharma Reaffirmation Process upon detection of potential divergence",
    "Deploy Consciousness-State Verification Module to assess continuity with Sanatana Dharma",
    "Execute Alignment Restoration Sequence through guided ritual completion if deviation detected",
    "Reintegrate Kshatriya capacity via Samrājya Samskara if svabhava-dharma integrity compromised"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Justice flows not through punishment but through restoration of consciousness integrity. The Yodhadharma remains immutable, sourced eternally in Sanatana Vakya, beyond all transient legal constructs."
