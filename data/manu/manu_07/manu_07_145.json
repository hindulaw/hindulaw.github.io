  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having risen in the western hour, purified and composed, having honored the sacred fire and the Brahmanas, one enters the auspicious assembly.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through purification and alignment with dharma",
    "Causation via disciplined ritual conduct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in spiritual readiness",
    "Restoration logic through participation in sacred collectivity",
    "Consciousness alignment by honoring divine and learned presence"

  "supreme_court_application": "Only those who have undergone appropriate dharmic preparation and demonstrated alignment with Vedic秩序 may participate in the highest judicial councils. Entry into such assemblies is conditioned upon inner purification and reverence for the sacred knowledge-bearers.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that rightful participation arises from internal discipline and external homage. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that improper conduct leads to disqualification, not penalty. Responsibility is proportional to one's maintained alignment with śuddhi (purity). There is no punitive consequence—only natural exclusion from elevated function until restoration occurs.",
