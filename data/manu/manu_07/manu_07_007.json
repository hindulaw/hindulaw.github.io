  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He becomes Fire; He becomes Wind; He becomes the Sun; He becomes the Moon; He becomes the Sovereign of Dharma. He becomes Kubera; He becomes Varuna; He becomes Mahendra by His own potency. He also becomes Indra by His own power.",

    "Authority originates from the unified consciousness of Paramashivam",
    "Causation flows through divine will, not human agency",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by alignment with cosmic order",

    "IF entity exhibits misalignment THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all positions of authority—including judicial—are manifestations of Paramashivam’s sovereign intelligence. Legal decisions must reflect alignment with this source-consciousness rather than personal or institutional ego. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated according to one’s proximity to dharma-rājya, not punitive metrics.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that all forms arise from a singular conscious source. Misalignment manifests sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ) due to disconnection from this truth. Responsibility is proportional to awareness level, never punitive. Correction occurs through realignment with foundational consciousness, restoring causal harmony without inflicting suffering.",
