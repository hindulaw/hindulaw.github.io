  "sanskrit_verse": "पृथुस्तु विनयाद्राज्यं प्राप्तवान् मनुरेव च । कुबेरश्च धनैश्वर्यं ब्राह्मण्यं चैव गाधिजः ॥ ७.४२॥",
  "transliteration": "pṛthus tu vinayād rājyaṁ prāptavān manureva ca | kuberaś ca dhanaśvaryaṁ brāhmaṇyaṁ caiva gādhijaḥ || 7.42||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Pṛthu attained sovereignty through humility; Manu also acquired rulership thereby. Kubera gained wealth-lordship, and Gādhi attained Brahmanical supremacy.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Dharma, not force or birth",
    "Humility is a causal factor in acquiring legitimate power",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines the scope of authority",
    "Restoration occurs through conscious re-alignment with source-duty",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes institutional legitimacy"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler exhibits humility THEN legitimacy of sovereignty IS affirmed",
    "IF individual aligns action with svadharma THEN authority IS naturally conferred",
    "IF person demonstrates capacity for stewardship THEN resource-control IS granted",
    "IF leadership originates from inner refinement THEN governance IS self-sustaining",
    "IF power is used for collective elevation THEN dominion IS preserved"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving state authority or institutional legitimacy, the threshold of responsibility lies not in procedural compliance but in demonstrable alignment with Dharma-rooted conduct. Humility, as exhibited by Pṛthu, becomes a judicially evaluable criterion for validating claims to rulership or spiritual preeminence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based discernment, it is established that humility functions as both cause and condition for rightful acquisition of power. This sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ) reflects proportional responsibility: the greater the humility, the greater the capacity to hold and sustain authority without deviation. There is no punitive element—only natural consequence aligned with consciousness integrity.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: authority flows from humility, legitimacy from alignment, and sovereignty from service. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
