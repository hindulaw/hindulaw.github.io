  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having thoroughly considered the place, time, capacity, and knowledge of beings who act contrary to justice, one must engage them with appropriate reverence and according to their due.",

    "Authority is context-dependent upon spatial-temporal conditions",

The threshold of responsibility is not punitive but calibrated to restore integrity while honoring the being's potential for alignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that misalignment stems from incomplete knowledge or dissonant environment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that rectification follows sequential recognition of context, capacity, and consciousness. Proportional responsibility aligns with the agent’s inherent dignity.
