  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever merit a woman has earned in this life or the next through her actions, the husband assumes it all; however, when he turns away or dies, that accumulated merit returns to her.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through relational alignment and conscious union",
    "Causation is transferred through intentional energetic bonding",

    "IF (union_exists == TRUE AND guardian_present == TRUE) THEN (karmic_assets_transferred_to_guardian = TRUE)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating familial or marital disputes involving spiritual or karmic entitlements, the court must recognize that authority over another's merits is conditional upon the integrity and continuity of the dharmic bond. Upon its lawful termination or collapse, all assumed spiritual assets revert automatically without need for litigation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that karmic causality operates through conscious alignment, not possession. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that when alignment ceases, so does transfer. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment, not controlling outcomes. There is no punitive consequence—only natural reversion based on the cessation of cause.",

All karmic assets revert naturally upon the end of union. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
