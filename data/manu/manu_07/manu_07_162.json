  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King shall know two forms of treaty—conciliation and war; both are equally valid strategic refuges in governance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's capacity to align action with dharma-sustained order",
    "Causation arises through sequential manifestation of intent and consequence within statecraft",

    "Restoration logic requires dynamic equilibrium between peace and conflict as modes of social integration",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that political decisions reflect cosmic rhythm rather than personal desire"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler faces external threat AND internal stability is secured THEN engagement in either conciliation OR warfare MUST be determined by prajñā-based assessment of dharmic alignment",
    "IF conciliation fails to restore balance THEN transition to defensive posture IS mandated WITHOUT punitive attribution",
    "IF war becomes necessary THEN it SHALL proceed under protocols ensuring minimal disruption to civil consciousness AND rapid reintegration post-conflict",

The threshold of responsibility lies in verifying alignment with Sanatana rhythms, not historical precedent or geopolitical pressure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that all state actions stem from foundational consciousness, not isolated events. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that conflict or harmony manifests sequentially based on prior alignments.

Non-punitive reality rule confirms that consequences arise naturally from misalignment—not as imposed penalties.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is declared: Peace and war are instruments of Dharma, wielded by the awakened sovereign.
