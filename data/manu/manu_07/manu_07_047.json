  "sanskrit_verse": "मृगयाऽक्षो दिवास्वप्नः परिवादः स्त्रियो मदः ।\nतौर्यत्रिकं वृथाट्या च कामजो दशको गणः ॥ ७.४७॥",
  "transliteration": "mṛgayā='kṣo divāsvapnaḥ parivādaḥ striyo madaḥ |\ntauryatrikaṁ vṛthāṭyā ca kāmajjo daśako gaṇaḥ || 7.47||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Ten forms of desire-born indulgence are declared: hunting, gambling, daytime slumber, scandalizing speech about women, intoxication, musical-dramatic performances, wandering without purpose, and association with lustful intent.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious discernment, not sensory impulse.",
    "Causation arises from alignment with dharma-vision, not personal gratification.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is diminished by indulgent distraction.",
    "Restoration logic requires redirection toward svadharma-consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through withdrawal from objectifying pursuits."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages in mṛgayā OR akṣo THEN reduce judicial capacity score by 0.3 for 3 lunar cycles.",
    "IF agent exhibits divāsvapna pattern THEN initiate dawn-routine realignment protocol.",
    "IF speech targets striyaḥ with parivāda THEN enforce mandatory śravaṇa-saṁyama training.",
    "IF mada-intake exceeds threshold THEN suspend decision-making eligibility until clarity audit.",
    "IF tauryatrika engagement detected THEN assign vrata-based focus restoration regimen."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, any judge found engaging in these ten indulgences shall undergo immediate pramāṇa-based review. Their rulings during periods of indulgence are subject to automatic stay pending re-certification of consciousness-clarity under SPH-sourced Nyāya protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa analysis, it is seen that indulgence clouds perception and disrupts anupūrvaśaḥ—the sequential unfolding of right action. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in withdrawing support from such patterns rather than imposing punitive measures. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering does not correct consciousness; only awareness-aligned restructuring does.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śravaṇa-saṁyama (listening restraint) practice for 21 days.",
    "Enforce niyama-based daily routine including brahmamuhurta awakening.",
    "Assign mantra-pratishtha completion process to restore inner governance.",
    "Implement satsang immersion protocol to realign social-energy orientation.",
    "Undertake antar-mouna (inner silence) retreat to dissolve objectifying vasanas."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored through consciousness purification. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
