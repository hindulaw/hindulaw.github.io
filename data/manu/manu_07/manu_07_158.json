  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who serves the enemy of another shall be known as the immediate follower of that enemy; beyond both, the neutral party holds the highest position.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through alignment with consciousness, not proximity to conflict",
    "Causation is determined by conscious intent rather than external association",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by one's choice of alignment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes neutrality and transcendence over adversarial engagement",
    "Consciousness alignment determines jurisdiction in relational dharmic disputes"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity aligns with or supports the opposition of a sovereign-consciousness unit, THEN it shall be classified as functionally equivalent to that opposition.",
    "IF two conflicting parties exist, AND a third party remains uninvolved WHILE maintaining equanimity, THEN that third party possesses superior adjudicative authority.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating high-level constitutional matters involving factional conflicts, the Supreme Court must recognize neutrality as the highest form of integrity. Parties accused of aiding adversaries must be assessed based on intent and alignment, not incidental association. The court assumes jurisdiction only when it maintains absolute detachment and consciousness-centered discernment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true causality lies in conscious alignment, not superficial association. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that serving an adversary stems from inner identification, which must be addressed through consciousness realignment. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of intentional synchronization. There is no punitive consequence—only a natural restoration toward neutrality and self-sovereignty.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice is executed exclusively for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is hereby restored."
