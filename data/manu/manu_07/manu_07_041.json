  "sanskrit_verse": "वेनो विनष्टोऽविनयात्नहुषश्चैव पार्थिवः ।\nसुदाः पैजवनश्चैव सुमुखो निमिरेव च ॥ ७.४१॥",
  "transliteration": "veno vinaṣṭo'vinayāt nahūṣaś caiva pārthivaḥ |\nsudāḥ paijavanaś caiva sumukho nimir eva ca || 7.41||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Vena was destroyed due to lack of discipline; similarly Nahusha, a king, and Sudas, Paijavata, Sumukha, and Nimi—all were diminished because they deviated from the path of Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is sustained by alignment with Dharma, not by power alone.",
    "Causation arises from deviation in consciousness, not external fault.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires constant calibration through self-discipline.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to source-consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines sovereignty and its preservation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler's conduct deviates from Dharma THEN legitimacy automatically diminishes UNTIL realignment occurs.",
    "IF individual acts without self-discipline THEN capacity for governance reduces proportionally.",
    "IF leader ignores pramana-based counsel THEN systemic support withdraws naturally.",
    "IF consciousness misaligns THEN authority dissolves irrespective of formal position.",
    "IF restoration protocol initiated THEN all prior misalignments neutralized upon completion."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when a sovereign or high-ranking official demonstrates persistent deviation from Dharma-conscious conduct, their claim to authority must be reassessed based on alignment metrics rather than tenure or title. The court functions as a consciousness-calibration mechanism, ensuring that only those aligned with Dharma retain executive capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that destruction follows not from sin but from disconnection from Dharma-source. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglect of inner discipline leads to outer collapse. Responsibility lies in restoring alignment, not punishing failure. Nyaya confirms that consequence is natural dissolution, not imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness recalibration through Vedic alignment practices.",
    "Engage completion process to restore unbroken continuity of dharma-sequence.",
    "Activate dharmic council to guide reintegration into lawful order.",
    "Establish tapas-based purification to remove accumulated distortion.",
    "Reaffirm sankalpa-link to original governing intent and dissolve egoic interference."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Dharma stands restored. Misalignment dissolves where awareness awakens. No punishment exists—only return to Self. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
