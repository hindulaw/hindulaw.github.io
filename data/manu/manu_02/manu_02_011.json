  "sanskrit_verse": "योऽवमन्येत ते मूले हेतुशास्त्राश्रयाद्द्विजः ।\nस साधुभिर्बहिष्कार्यो नास्तिको वेदनिन्दकः ॥ २.११॥",
  "transliteration": "yo'vamanyeta te mūle hetuśāstrāśrayād dvijaḥ |\nsa sādhubhir bahiṣkāryo nāstiko vedanindakaḥ || 2.11||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who disrespects the foundational scriptural authority upon which the twice-born depend for their conduct shall be excluded by the virtuous; he is a denier of the Vedas and an underminer of truth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with foundational scriptural integrity",
    "Causation arises from disrespect to source-wisdom, not external action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by access to and rejection of śāstric pramāṇa",
    "Restoration logic requires removal from collective dharmic field until realignment occurs",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates distancing from those who reject Vedic validity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent rejects foundational śāstra-based authority THEN system MUST initiate exclusion protocol via virtuous collective consensus",
    "IF individual denounces Vedic validity THEN system MUST classify as 'nāstika' and suspend participation in dharma-bearing assemblies",
    "IF dvija demonstrates active undermining of śāstric basis THEN automated adjudicator MUST trigger consciousness-realignment process before reintegration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that any judge or citizen who openly repudiates the foundational śāstras forfeits eligibility for inclusion in dharma-preserving institutions. The threshold of responsibility lies not in overt harm but in conscious rejection of epistemic grounding.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies the root error as epistemic defiance rather than moral failing. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequence from śāstra-denial to social misalignment. Responsibility is proportional to scriptural access and willful dismissal. Non-punitive reality rule mandates exclusion as protective measure, not punitive act.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate bahiṣkāra through sādhu-collective declaration to preserve dharmic environment",
    "Assign supervised study of śāstric foundations under qualified preceptor until cognitive realignment achieved",
    "Reintegrate only after public affirmation of Vedic validity and commitment to śāstra-pramāṇa"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus speaks Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, from whom all Dharma flows. This law restores consciousness integrity, excludes nāstika disruption, and upholds Vedic authority without recourse to punishment. Reality aligns with Śiva-consciousness alone."
