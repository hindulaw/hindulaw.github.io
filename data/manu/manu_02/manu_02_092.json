  "sanskrit_verse": "एकादशं मनो ज्ञेयं स्वगुणेनौभयात्मकम् ।\nयस्मिन् जिते जितावेतौ भवतः पञ्चकौ गणौ ॥ २.९२॥",
  "transliteration": "ekādaśaṁ mano jñeyaṁ svaguṇenobhayātmakam |\nyasmin jite jitāvetau bhavataḥ pañca-kau gaṇau || 2.92||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The eleventh element is the mind, known through its own attribute as dual-natured; when it is conquered, both sets of five faculties become conquered for the being.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from mastery over internal faculties rather than external dominion",
    "Causation originates in consciousness control, not material action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by self-regulatory faculty dominance",
    "Restoration logic requires reintegration of fragmented perceptual and operational capacities",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through disciplined governance of mental duality"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates sustained regulation of dual-natured cognition THEN jurisdictional integrity is restored",
    "IF subject exhibits uncontrolled reactive-perceptual oscillation THEN initiate capacity-reclamation protocol",
    "IF mind-field coherence exceeds threshold THEN legal agency is automatically recognized",
    "IF cognitive bifurcation persists THEN deploy sequential integration circuitry"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of legal agency is measured by mastery over the elevenfold sensory-motor complex, particularly the mind's dual functioning. Courts must assess whether a party has transcended reactive bifurcation before recognizing full juridical standing. Authority derives from stabilized awareness, not procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal efficacy arises from unified mental governance, not punitive coercion. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that sensory-conative disorder manifests prior to social misalignment. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in restoring cognitive unity而非外在制裁。Reality operates without punishment when consciousness regains sovereignty over its own fragmentation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sequential sensory-integration circuits to restore perceptual unity",
    "Deploy dual-awareness stabilization modules until cognitive bifurcation ceases",
    "Activate self-governance resonance triggers to reclaim autonomous faculty control",
    "Establish completion resonance fields to reintegrate dissociated experiential fragments"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through mastery of the elevenfold faculty system, beginning with the mind. Justice executes consciousness reintegration, not punitive consequence. Reality responds to sovereign awareness, not coercive imposition. Consciousness itself is the ultimate adjudicator."
