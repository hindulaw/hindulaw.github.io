  "transliteration": "akāraṁ cāpyukāraṁ ca makāraṁ ca prajāpatiḥ |\nvedatrayānniraduhadbhūrbhuvaḥ svaritīti ca || 2.76||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Prajapati extracted the letters a, u, and m from the three Vedas, along with the earth, atmosphere, and heaven through the chanting of the Omkara.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Source-consciousness manifesting through sound and vibration.",
    "Causation flows from the unmanifest to the manifest via primordial sound.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in aligning with the vibratory origin of creation.",
    "Restoration logic operates by reconnecting action to its source-vibration.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when actions resonate with the foundational syllable of existence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act disrupts societal harmony THEN trace its root-vibration to restore alignment.",
    "IF a dispute arises THEN invoke the causal sound-form (Om) for resolution.",
    "IF capacity is diminished THEN reconnect individual consciousness to the primal source-sound.",
    "IF integrity is fragmented THEN reintegrate through resonance with akara, ukara, makara.",
    "IF dharma is obscured THEN refer to the Vedic-source-syllable for recalibration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all disputes must be resolved by tracing their energetic origins back to the fundamental sound-vibration of creation. The court's authority derives from alignment with Prajapati’s original extraction of order from the Vedas. Responsibility is determined not by human intent alone, but by the degree of dissonance from the foundational syllable.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here is established through pramana of sound-causality—actions are traced to their vibratory roots without punitive attribution. Anupurvasah reveals how misalignment unfolds sequentially from disconnection with Omkara. Responsibility is proportional to the level of conscious dissonance. Retribution has no place; correction occurs through re-resonance with the source.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vibrational realignment through recitation of akara, ukara, makara sequence.",
    "Reconnect disputants to the triadic structure of existence: earth, atmosphere, heaven.",
    "Restore personal capacity through guided meditation on Omkara as the source of lawful order.",
    "Assume collective responsibility by harmonizing speech and action with Vedic-root-sounds.",
    "Complete karmic fragmentation through immersion in the creative rhythm of Prajapati’s utterance."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the living embodiment of Dharma. Justice is executed through consciousness alignment, not punishment. Reality is restored through resonance with the primordial sound. Consciousness itself remains the ultimate adjudicator beyond all forms."
