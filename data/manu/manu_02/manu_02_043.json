  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the acquisition of muñja grass, actions must be performed using kuśa, aśmantaka, and balvaja grasses; these acts are to be conducted by one knot-binder, with three or fivefold procedures.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in procedural alignment with natural elements",
    "Causation is established through ritual precision and material integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in correct instrumental selection and application",
    "Restoration logic operates via elemental harmonization and consecrated process execution",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action conforms to Vedic structuring principles"
  ],

    "IF ritual material ≠ {kuśa OR aśmantaka OR balvaja} THEN validity = false",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes that jurisdictional acts deriving from Vedic injunctions require precise adherence to specified materials and procedural counts. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by intent but by fidelity to form. Authority flows from alignment with cosmic structuring laws.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that efficacy arises solely from correct configuration. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential activation without punitive consequence. Proportional responsibility aligns with degree of deviation. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that misalignment results in ineffectiveness, not penalty.",
