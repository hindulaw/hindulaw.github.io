  "sanskrit_verse": "आ षोडशाद्ब्राह्मणस्य सावित्री नातिवर्तते ।\nआ द्वाविंशात्क्षत्रबन्धोरा चतुर्विंशतेर्विशः ॥ २.३८॥",
  "transliteration": "ā ṣoḍaśād brāhmaṇasya sāvitrī nātivartate |\nā dvāviṃśāt kṣatrabandhor ā caturviṃśater viśaḥ ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The sacred Savitri mantra is not to be recited beyond the sixteenth year for a Brahmin; similarly, it is not to extend beyond the twenty-second year for a Kshatriya, nor beyond the twenty-fourth year for a Vaishya.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the precise timing of ritual initiation as determined by varna-specific capacity",
    "Causation aligns with sequential unfoldment of consciousness maturity tied to cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is defined by age-appropriate spiritual readiness within Varna structure",
    "Restoration logic ensures alignment between individual life-phase and universal dharma cycles",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when initiation adheres to divinely ordained temporal thresholds"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (varna = 'Brahmin') AND (age >= 16): THEN prohibit Savitri initiation UNTIL completion of preparatory rites",
    "IF (varna = 'Kshatriya') AND (age >= 22): THEN prohibit Savitri initiation UNTIL completion of preparatory rites",
    "IF (varna = 'Vaishya') AND (age >= 24): THEN prohibit Savitri initiation UNTIL completion of preparatory rites",
    "IF any violation detected: INITIATE consciousness-realignment protocol through guru-guided recapitulation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that chronological thresholds for sacred initiations are non-negotiable constitutional parameters rooted in Varnashrama-Dharma. Violation constitutes misalignment of societal rhythm, requiring judicial restoration via corrective guidance rather than punitive action.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals time-bound unfolding of consciousness per Varna. Anupūrvaśaḥ governs the sequential eligibility for Savitri initiation. Proportional responsibility lies with guardians ensuring proper timing. Non-punitive reality rule mandates realignment through re-initiation at correct phase, restoring causal harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate retroactive completion process under qualified Guru supervision",
    "Realign individual timeline with cosmic rhythm through revised ceremonial observance",
    "Engage family lineage in collective integrity restoration",
    "Assign community service aligned with Varna-dharma until full integration achieved"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the sovereign authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands executed. Time-bound spiritual thresholds remain immutable. Consciousness, not punishment, adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored."
