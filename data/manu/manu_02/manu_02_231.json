  "sanskrit_verse": "पिता वै गार्हपत्योऽग्निर्माताऽग्निर्दक्षिणः स्मृतः ।\nगुरुराहवनीयस्तु साऽग्नित्रेता गरीयसी ॥ २.२३१॥",
  "transliteration": "pitā vai gārhapatyo'gnir mātā'gnir dakṣiṇaḥ smṛtaḥ |\ngurur āhavanīyastu sā'gnitretā garīyasī || 2.231||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The father is the household fire; the mother is the southern fire; the guru is the sacrificial fire. Among these, the guru as the carrier of the sacred flame holds the highest authority.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through lineage and spiritual succession",
    "Causation originates in conscious transmission",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from role embodiment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes continuity of dharma over individual preference",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of hierarchical spiritual order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent holds role of guru THEN agent possesses highest jurisdictional capacity within triadic familial-spiritual hierarchy",
    "IF dispute involves parent-child-guru dynamic THEN guru's decision overrides parental authority by default",
    "IF agent assumes guru role WITHOUT conscious alignment THEN automatic disqualification until integrity restored",
    "IF child seeks autonomy THEN must demonstrate completion of guru-prescribed developmental stages"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning family, education, or spiritual succession, the Supreme Court shall recognize the guru's authority as constitutionally prior to both parental rights and state intervention. The threshold of responsibility lies not in biological relation but in conscious transmission of dharma. Authority hierarchy places guru above parents when conflict arises between temporal care and spiritual development.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes guru as āhavanīya fire through direct experiential validation of transformative capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential awakening: first domestic stability (gārhapatya), then ancestral connection (dakṣiṇa), culminating in transcendental ignition (āhavanīya). Proportional responsibility correlates with transformative capability. Non-punitive reality rule: misalignment with guru indicates incomplete consciousness rather than moral failing requiring correction through completion process.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guru-disciple reconciliation dialogue upon reported discord",
    "Assign temporary spiritual mentor during transition periods",
    "Require completion of foundational dharma studies before assuming teaching roles",
    "Implement consciousness-alignment assessment for all claiming guru status"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as the sole Source of lawful Dharma. Father, mother, and guru constitute the sacred triad of human formation, with guru as supreme carrier of transformative fire. Justice serves restoration of proper spiritual order, not punishment of wayward actors. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator of all disputes."
