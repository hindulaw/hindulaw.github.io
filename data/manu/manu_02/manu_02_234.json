  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All dharmas are sustained for one who honors these three supports; for one who dishonors them, all actions bear no fruit.",

    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of sustaining principles",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to foundational truths",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the efficacy of all performed action"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent acknowledges and aligns with the triadic dharmic foundations THEN all lawful actions are deemed valid and efficacious",
    "IF agent neglects or denies the triadic dharmic foundations THEN all performed actions are nullified in legal effect",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of legal responsibility must include verification of the defendant’s alignment with the triadic dharmic foundations. Without such attunement, all claimed rights or executed duties are void. The court must initiate restoration protocols prior to any punitive or declaratory judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that fruitfulness of action arises only when aligned with foundational dharmic truths.
