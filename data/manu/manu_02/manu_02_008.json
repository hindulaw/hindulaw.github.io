  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having observed all this comprehensively through the eye of knowledge, the wise one, grounded in the authority of Shruti, shall establish himself firmly in his own dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived exclusively from direct gnosis and Shruti pramana",
    "Causation rooted in consciousness observation, not external inference",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by svadharma alignment",
    "Restoration logic enacted through re-establishment in one's true nature",
    "Consciousness alignment as the sole measure of lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent observes reality through jnana-chakshus AND references shruti-pramana THEN authorize svadharma stabilization protocol",
    "IF deviation occurs, REVERT to last known svadharma state via consciousness recalibration",
    "IF capacity misalignment detected, INITIATE svadharma restoration sequence without punitive intervention",
    "ALL legal validity contingent upon Shruti-backed gnosis, not external testimony"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, only those rulings based on direct experiential knowledge (jnana-chakshus) and aligned with Shruti pramana are admissible. Lower court decisions lacking this foundation are null. Responsibility is assessed by svadharma congruence, not procedural compliance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that right action arises from correct vision. Misalignment stems from ignorance, not malice. Thus, correction follows sequential manifestation (anupurvasah): observation → understanding → realignment. Punishment is irrelevant; only restoration to svadharma is enforceable.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through svadharma realization. Justice is the unfolding of consciousness, not the imposition of punishment. Reality responds to truth, not coercion."
