  "transliteration": "kāmaṃ tu gurupatnīnāṃ yuvatīnāṃ yuvā bhuvi |\nvidhivadvandanaṃ kuryād asāv aham iti bruvan || 2.216 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A young man upon earth desiring the wives of his guru or youthful women shall perform ritual salutation lawfully, declaring 'he is not me.'",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The Guru holds spiritual and relational sovereignty over the disciple.",
    "Causation: Desire arises from misidentification; proper recognition dissolves unlawful impulse.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One must act within conscious alignment to relational dharma.",
    "Restoration logic: Proper acknowledgment and separation restore integrity of relationship.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Recognition of non-identity ('he is not me') realigns consciousness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent desires another's spouse OR guru's consort THEN initiate vidhi-vandana protocol.",
    "DECLARE 'asau aham' to dissolve identification with desire-object.",
    "RESTORE relational integrity through formal acknowledgment of ownership boundaries.",
    "ENSURE no action proceeds without prior completion of detachment declaration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving relational misconduct or breach of spiritual authority, the threshold of responsibility lies in the failure to recognize ontological distinction. Courts must apply vidhi-vandana protocols as restorative interventions before adjudicating intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that desire stems from avidyā (misrecognition). By performing vidhivad-vandana with explicit declaration of non-identity, causal distortion is reversed sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ), aligning pramāṇa with dharma without invoking punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vidhi-vandana process under witness of spiritual or judicial authority.",
    "Require declaratory utterance: 'asau aham' – establishing cognitive separation.",
    "Assign reflective study of relational dharma until capacity for non-misidentification is restored.",
    "Reintegrate individual into community only after successful demonstration of consciousness realignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
