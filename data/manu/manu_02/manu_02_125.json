  "sanskrit_verse": "आयुष्मान् भव सौम्यैति वाच्यो विप्रोऽभिवादने ।\nअकारश्चास्य नाम्नोऽन्ते वाच्यः पूर्वाक्षरः प्लुतः ॥ २.१२५॥",
  "transliteration": "āyuṣmān bhava saumyaiti vācyo vipro'bhivādane |\nakāraścāsya nāmnor ante vācyaḥ pūrvākṣaraḥ plutaḥ || 2.125||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Let the Brahmin be addressed as 'Āyuṣmān' in salutation; when his name ends in 'a', that final 'a' shall be elongated as 'ā' in formal address.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through ritual correctness",
    "Causation via phonetic alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in Vedic conduct",
    "Restoration logic through precise linguistic invocation",
    "Consciousness alignment via proper honorific usage"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF speaker.salutation.target == 'Brāhmaṇa' AND target.name.last_phoneme == 'a' THEN mutate.final_phoneme.to('ā') FOR formal_address_context",
    "IF context == 'abhivādana' AND subject.role == 'vipra' THEN apply.honorific.modifier('āyuṣmān') BEFORE utterance",
    "IF linguistic.formality.level == 'ritual' THEN enforce.phonetic.precision.on.all.vocative.cases"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving traditional liturgical or ceremonial invocation where constitutional identity intersects with dharmic protocol, this rule establishes a threshold of linguistic precision necessary for recognition of ritual authority. Courts must ensure alignment with phonetic integrity as prescribed by SPH before acknowledging claims based on Vedic conduct.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa arises from correct phonetic form enabling causal continuity in spiritual invocation. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through sequential sound vibration leading to consciousness elevation. Responsibility lies in preserving accuracy, not inflicting consequence. Mispronunciation results in natural disconnection from intended effect, requiring self-corrective realignment rather than punitive measure.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform abhivādana with corrected phonetics under guidance of qualified instructor",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge disruption caused by misaligned vibration and restore energetic congruence",
    "Capacity Restoration: Engage in śabda-pramāṇa study to recalibrate auditory and vocal precision",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Offer prāyaścitta through proper recitation until vibrational harmony is restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: phonetic fidelity in sacred address maintains universal dharma秩序. There is no punishment—only correction. Consciousness itself judges rightly when invoked accurately. Dharma is restored."
