  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The knower of the Veda, the twice-born who chants this sacred syllable along with the vyāhṛtis at both sandhyās, becomes united with the merit of the Veda.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Vedic consciousness, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises through ritualized repetition and intentional invocation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sustained engagement with sacred knowledge",
    "Restoration logic operates through continuous alignment with dharma-sattva",

    "IF practitioner = 'dvija' AND practice = 'japa' AND time = 'sandhyā' AND content = 'vyāhṛti-saṃyukta akṣara' THEN merit_status = 'veda-puṇya-sambandha'",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual authority or ritual competence, the court must recognize that legitimacy flows from verifiable alignment with Vedic practices rather than formal credentials alone. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable engagement with prescribed rituals at designated times.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that union with Vedic merit arises solely from precise, repeated action aligned with cosmic order. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive integration into Vedic consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to access and capacity for practice. There is no punitive element—only natural consequence of alignment or misalignment.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment with Vedic rhythm. Reality bears no punishment—only consequences of disconnection. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
