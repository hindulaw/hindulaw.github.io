    "IF agent demonstrates continuous restraint of speech AND mind THEN grant access to highest jurisprudential authority",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those judges whose speech and mind are purified and guarded at all times shall be authorized to rule on matters concerning dharma, constitutional truth, or sovereignty.
