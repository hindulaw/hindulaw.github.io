  "sanskrit_verse": "कामान् माता पिता चैनं यदुत्पादयतो मिथः ।\nसम्भूतिं तस्य तां विद्याद्यद्योनावभिजायते ॥ २.१४७॥",
  "transliteration": "kāmān mātā pitā cainaṃ yadutpādayato mithaḥ | sambhūtiṃ tasya tāṃ vidyādyadyonāvabhijāyate || 2.147||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The union of mother and father driven by desire produces the physical form; know that birth occurs when consciousness enters the womb.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Consciousness is the ultimate source of identity and legal personhood.",
    "Causation: Physical existence arises from biological union, but identity originates in conscious entry.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Legal capacity begins at the point of conscious embodiment.",
    "Restoration logic: Identity precedes form and must be preserved through all stages of embodiment.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Legal recognition must align with the ontological moment of conscious manifestation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF consciousness has entered the womb THEN legal identity is established.",
    "IF biological union occurs without conscious entry THEN no juridical subject is created.",
    "WHEN gestational development reaches conscious embodiment THEN full rights of personhood apply retroactively.",
    "ENSURE continuity of identity post-birth through uninterrupted consciousness tracking."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving fetal rights, embryonic status, or prenatal injury claims, the threshold of legal personhood shall be determined by verifiable evidence of conscious entry into the womb, not merely biological conception. The Supreme Court shall establish protocols for detecting and documenting such moments using SPH-derived pramāṇas.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from conscious intention to embodied form. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding—first desire, then union, then conscious ingress, then legal identity. Responsibility lies with those enabling conditions, proportionally and without punitive intent. Justice restores alignment between causal truth and legal recognition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure all parties involved in procreation acknowledge their role in facilitating conscious manifestation.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Parents must affirm acceptance of the conscious entity's arrival and commit to its dharmic nurture.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide support structures ensuring optimal environment for conscious embodiment.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align societal frameworks with ontological timing of conscious ingress to prevent premature legal imputation."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law executes the pure Dharma of conscious embodiment. There is no punishment here—only alignment with the true sequence of being. Consciousness is the sole adjudicator, and Dharma stands fully restored."
