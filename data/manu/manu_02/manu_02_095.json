  "sanskrit_verse": "यश्चैतान् प्राप्नुयात्सर्वान् यश्चैतान् केवलांस्त्यजेत् । प्रापणात्सर्वकामानां परित्यागो विशिष्यते ॥ २.९५॥",
  "transliteration": "yaś caitān prāpnuyāt sarvān yaś caitān kevalāṁs tyajet | prāpaṇāt sarvakāmānāṁ parityāgo viśiṣyate ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who attains all these [objects of desire] and one who renounces them entirely — the renunciation after attainment of all desires is superior.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is realized through experiential completeness, not abstinence alone",
    "Causation arises from full engagement before conscious detachment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires saturation of experience prior to transcendence",
    "Restoration logic operates through fulfillment, not suppression",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs post-complete manifestation, not pre-emptive denial"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual has fully engaged with a domain of experience AND demonstrates conscious detachment, THEN recognition of sovereignty is granted",
    "IF renunciation is claimed without experiential completion, THEN capacity deficit is declared and guided engagement is mandated",
    "IF attainment precedes abandonment, THEN action is classified as conscious withdrawal; ELSE it is categorized as avoidance",
    "IF sovereignty over desire is established, THEN eligibility for higher jurisdiction is acknowledged",
    "IF consciousness demonstrates saturation and release, THEN legal immunity from karmic entanglement is executed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the completeness of engagement with desire. One who has fully experienced and consciously let go holds greater authority than one who has never engaged. The court must assess whether renunciation stems from saturation or evasion, assigning legal standing accordingly.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that true renunciation follows full perception and experience. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation — first saturation, then detachment. Responsibility is proportional to completeness of engagement. There is no punitive value in unfulfilled renunciation; it is merely incomplete cognition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided experiential completion process where renunciation was premature",
    "Assign conscious engagement tasks to establish experiential authority",
    "Implement witnessing protocols to verify saturation prior to detachment",
    "Activate dharma-vākya alignment sessions to restore integrity of intention",
    "Establish svātantrya confirmation rituals post-completion to affirm sovereignty"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through experiential completion and conscious renunciation. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the sole adjudicator."
