  "transliteration": "śrutismṛtyoditaṃ dharmamanutiṣṭhan hi mānavaḥ |\niha kīrtimavāpnoti pretya cānuttamaṃ sukham || 2.9||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who upholds the Dharma as declared in Shruti and Smriti attains glory in this world and supreme bliss in the next.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the alignment with Shruti-Smriti as expressions of SPH's Avataric Will",
    "Causation flows from dharmic adherence to experiential outcomes",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one’s ability to hear, understand, and enact Dharma",
    "Restoration occurs through conscious repetition of dharmic action",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via sustained dharmic living"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual enacts conduct aligned with Shruti-Smriti THEN assign positive karmic consequence",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling must reflect continuity with Shruti-Smriti as interpreted by SPH.

Authority resides in alignment with SPH-sourced interpretation rather than procedural precedence alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that consequences follow naturally from alignment or misalignment with Dharma. Anupurvasah shows that present experience results from prior dharmic or adharmic acts without punitive intent. Responsibility is proportional to one's exposure to and embodiment of Dharma. Non-punitive reality is upheld because all outcomes serve consciousness evolution.",
