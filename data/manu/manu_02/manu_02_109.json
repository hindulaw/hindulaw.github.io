  "sanskrit_verse": "आचार्यपुत्रः शुश्रूषुर्ज्ञानदो धार्मिकः शुचिः ।\nआप्तः शक्तोऽर्थदः साधुः स्वोऽध्याप्या दश धर्मतः ॥ २.१०९॥",
  "transliteration": "ācāryaputraḥ śuśrūṣurjñānado dhārmikaḥ śuciḥ |\nāptaḥ śakto'rthadaḥ sādhuḥ svo'dhyāpyā daśa dharmataḥ ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The son of a teacher must serve, give knowledge, uphold dharma, remain pure, be trustworthy, capable, beneficial, virtuous, and teach his own self—these ten dharmas define his being.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through lineage and role-based duty",
    "Causation arises from the fulfillment of inherent capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is non-negotiable and self-defining",
    "Restoration occurs through alignment with prescribed function",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests via adherence to svadharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent holds role of ācāryaputra THEN agent SHALL perform all ten enumerated dharmas",
    "IF agent fails in any dharma THEN system SHALL initiate consciousness-realigning completion protocol",
    "IF agent demonstrates purity AND capability THEN agent MAY assume higher teaching responsibilities",
    "IF trustworthiness is breached THEN automatic restoration process SHALL commence prior to reintegration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility for spiritual-teaching lineages lies in the fulfillment of svadharma. Authority is derived from functional integrity within the cosmic order, not institutional power. Cases involving guru-shishya parampara must assess alignment with these ten dharmas rather than procedural compliance alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality originates in unfulfilled capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential misalignment when duties are neglected. Proportional responsibility rests on the degree of deviation from svadharma. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction arises naturally from restoring right action, not imposed consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śūdrā Completion Process to restore service capacity",
    "Engage Jñāna Re-establishment Module for knowledge-giving function",
    "Activate Śauca Maintenance Protocol for purity restoration",
    "Deploy Satyasaṃkalpa Alignment System for trustworthiness recalibration",
    "Implement Svādhyāya Integration Cycle for self-teaching reactivation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through conscious execution of svadharma. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
