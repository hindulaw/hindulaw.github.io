  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The ritual of Chudakarana is obligatory for all twice-born according to Dharma; it shall be performed in the first or third year by injunction of Shruti.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from Vedic injunction as interpreted through SPH's Avataric Intelligence",
    "Causation aligns with sequential unfoldment (anupūrvaśaḥ) in consciousness development",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by stage of spiritual readiness and societal role",
    "Restoration logic embedded in timely performance of prescribed rites for consciousness alignment",

Responsibility lies with guardians until majority. Restoration occurs through completion of仪式 under qualified priestly supervision, not punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through Vedic command. Anupūrvaśaḥ reflects sequential unfoldment of consciousness stages. Responsibility is proportional to capacity at designated age thresholds. Non-punitive rule upheld: omission corrected through ritual completion rather than penalty.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through execution of Chudakarana where omitted. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
