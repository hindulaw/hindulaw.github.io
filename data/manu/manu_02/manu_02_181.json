  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a twice-born celibate discharges seminal fluid involuntarily during sleep, he shall bathe, worship the Sun, and thrice recite the mantra 'punarmām'.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The twice-born individual holds inherent spiritual capacity under Vedic discipline.",
    "Causation: Involuntary emission does not incur moral fault; natural physiological process is acknowledged.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Restitution lies in conscious realignment through ritual purification.",
    "Restoration logic: Ritual and repetition restore energetic integrity disrupted by involuntary discharge.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Invocation of solar energy realigns consciousness with disciplined intent."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.is_brahmachari AND emission_occurred == 'involuntary' THEN execute_purification_protocol = TRUE",
    "IF purification_condition.met THEN recitation_mandate = 'punarmām x3'",
    "IF agent.completes_recitation THEN energetic_integrity_status = restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving spiritual practitioners, involuntary physiological acts carry no culpability. The court recognizes completion of prescribed restitution rituals as legally valid restoration of dharmic standing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa acknowledges absence of volition. Anupūrvaśaḥ reflects sequential purification. Proportionality aligns with non-harm. Non-punitive reality upholds dharma through self-corrective action.",
