  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who faces east attains longevity; one who faces south gains fame; one who faces west acquires wealth; one who faces north realizes cosmic order.",

    "Authority flows directionally through conscious orientation",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the individual’s directional alignment. Authority hierarchy reflects conscious orientation. Restoration prevails over retribution when misalignment is corrected through proper directional realignment protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that outcomes arise from directional orientation. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of results based on spatial alignment. Proportional responsibility corresponds to degree of deviation from source-direction. Non-punitive reality rule affirms correction through conscious reorientation rather than punitive measures.",

    "Initiate completion process for directional realignment",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol aligned with cardinal direction",
    "Restore capacity through guided spatial orientation towards source-direction",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through directional consciousness alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
