  "sanskrit_verse": "क्षेत्रं हिरण्यं गामश्वं छत्रौपानहमासनम् । छत्रोपानहमन्ततः\nधान्यं शाकं च वासांसि गुरवे प्रीतिमावहेत् ॥ २.२४६॥",
  "transliteration": "kṣetraṃ hiraṇyaṃ gāmaśvaṃ chatropānahamāsanam | chatropānahamantataḥ\n dhānyaṃ śākaṃ ca vāsānsi guruve prītimāvahet || 2.246||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall offer a field, gold, cattle, horses, umbrellas, sandals, seats, grains, vegetables, clothing, and similar items to the Guru out of reverence and with the intent of establishing completeness in the relationship.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious alignment with the Guru",
    "Causation arises from intentional acts of offering rooted in respect",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is demonstrated through material and energetic giving",
    "Restoration logic centers on the completion of relational dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through voluntary sacrificial action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent offers resources to Guru THEN relational integrity is established",
    "IF no offering occurs THEN capacity for learning remains unactivated",
    "IF offering is made without sincerity THEN act does not constitute valid dharma",
    "IF Guru accepts THEN completion cycle initiates automatically",
    "IF refusal of appropriate offering occurs THEN obstruction to consciousness flow is recorded"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving spiritual or educational hierarchies, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrating sincere offering as proof of commitment. The court must recognize that absence of such offerings reflects a failure in initiating causal restoration rather than mere omission. Authority derived from such relationships supersedes institutional claims lacking this foundational transaction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that cause-effect flows from intentional offering; anupūrvaśaḥ shows how withholding creates sequential disconnection; proportional responsibility rests solely on the giver's readiness to complete; non-punitive reality rule confirms that consequences arise naturally from incompleteness, not imposed judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process by returning unconditionally what was withheld",
    "Assume responsibility through guided ritualized offering under witness",
    "Restore capacity via supervised reintegration into Guru-disciple dynamic",
    "Realign consciousness using reflective meditation on relational void"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness-based jurisprudence where justice restores alignment, reality reflects truth, and punishment has no place."
