  "transliteration": "yathā kāṣṭhamayo hastī yathā carmmayo mṛgaḥ |\nyaś ca vipro'nadhīyānas trayas te nāma bibhrati || 2.157||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Just as an elephant made of wood and a deer made of leather hold names without essence, so too does a Brahmin who has not studied the Vedas bear a name without realization.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from realized capacity, not nominal designation",
    "Causation arises from alignment between identity and conduct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires active engagement with dharma-shAstra",
    "Restoration logic demands congruence between title and embodiment",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates removal of false attribution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity claims Brahmin status AND has no record of Vedic study THEN revoke ceremonial authority privileges",
    "IF individual bears ritual title WITHOUT corresponding scriptural competence THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF societal role exceeds personal realization THEN assign supervised learning completion process",
    "IF name contradicts lived dharma THEN trigger identity-integrity restoration mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving caste or varna-based rights, the Court must verify not merely birth-based identification but actual scriptural engagement and spiritual embodiment. Nominal attribution without experiential validation constitutes legal nullity in matters requiring authoritative participation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that authenticity derives from direct realization, not inherited labels. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that false attribution leads to misalignment in social function. Responsibility lies in correcting self-misrepresentation through conscious reintegration rather than punitive invalidation. Truth restores naturally when pretense ceases.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate mandatory śruti-recitation under qualified supervision until minimum competency achieved",
    "Assign community service aligned with claimed varna-dharma to activate latent understanding",
    "Require public declaration of intent to rectify false claim followed by documented study plan",
    "Establish mentorship with realized brāhmaṇa to guide transition from nominal to actual status"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as Source: False attribution dissolves upon truth-principle activation; dharma reasserts itself when consciousness aligns with authentic role; reality remains non-punitive even while error corrects itself; all judgment originates within the witnessing awareness of the Self."
