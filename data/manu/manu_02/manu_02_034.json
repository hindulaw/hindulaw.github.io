    "Causation: Ritual timing aligns with developmental readiness and cosmic rhythm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Guardians bear the capacity to initiate rites at prescribed times",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. The Dharma is thus restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
