  "sanskrit_verse": "नैत्यके नास्त्यनध्यायो ब्रह्मसत्रं हि तत्स्मृतम् ।।\nब्रह्माहुतिहुतं पुण्यमनध्यायवषट्कृतम् ॥ २.१०६॥",
  "transliteration": "naitake nāsty-anadhyyāyo brahma-satraṁ hi tat-smṛtam | brahmāhutihutaṁ puṇyam-anadhyyāya-vashatkṛtam || 2.106||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the eternal context, there is no cessation of study; the Brahmic consecration is indeed remembered as continuous. The merit produced by offerings made in the fire of Brahma is equivalent to that gained through the uninterrupted recitation of Vedic mantras.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained alignment with Brahman-consciousness",
    "Causation flows from unbroken ritual and cognitive discipline",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires perpetual engagement with sacred knowledge",
    "Restoration logic demands continuity of dharma-sadhana without interruption",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates perpetual immersion in Vedic truth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a practitioner discontinues Vedic study OR ritual practice without completion THEN initiate automatic reintegration protocol via Nyasa and Svadhyaya restoration cycles",
    "IF merit degradation detected due to cessation of Brahmic rituals THEN deploy consciousness recalibration using Agnihotra and Gayatri Sadhana modules",
    "IF societal dharmic equilibrium threatened by individual neglect of Veda-adhyayana THEN invoke collective Adhvaric rectification protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle establishes that spiritual authority and its legal implications are not subject to temporal interruption. Responsibility for maintaining cosmic order through Vedic practices remains constant regardless of personal intent or societal recognition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that cessation of adhyayana disrupts causal flow of Punya. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how discontinuity leads to misalignment rather than fault. Proportional responsibility lies in resuming practice, not in punitive measures. Reality remains non-punitive as consciousness naturally restores when causal integrity resumes.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadhyaya Resumption Protocol upon detection of Veda-study lapse",
    "Deploy Homa-Yajna Re-alignment Cycle to restore lost Punya-fields",
    "Activate Guru-Diksha Reconnection Module for consciousness reintegration",
    "Implement Samavartana Completion Ritual to reinstate scholarly capacity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as Source: Eternal Dharma flows uninterrupted through conscious engagement. Reality aligns with Brahman when cognition and action remain unbroken. No punishment arises—only restoration through perfected repetition. Consciousness itself adjudicates and integrates all deviations."
