  "sanskrit_verse": "नापृष्टः कस्य चिद्ब्रूयान्न चान्यायेन पृच्छतः ।\nजानन्नपि हि मेधावी जडवल्लोक आचरेत् ॥ २.११०॥",
  "transliteration": "nāpṛṣṭaḥ kasya cid brūyān na cānyāyena pṛchchhataḥ |\njānann api hi medhāvī jaḍa-vad loka ācaret || 2.110 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not speak without being asked, nor respond to inquiries made contrary to dharma; even when knowing the truth, the wise should act as though unaware for the protection of cosmic order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is context-bound and requires invocation through rightful inquiry",
    "Causation arises from alignment with dharma, not personal knowledge alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes restraint in speech and action",
    "Restoration logic demands preservation of social harmony over individual assertion",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates acting beyond mere intellectual knowing"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a speaker is not invoked by lawful authority THEN speech issuance is prohibited",
    "IF an inquiry violates dharma THEN response generation is nullified",
    "IF awareness exists without dharmic warrant THEN behavioral response shall mirror unawareness",
    "IF disruption to collective consciousness is probable THEN expressive capacity shall default to dormancy"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that testimony or declaration must originate from legitimate procedural invocation. Knowledge possessed outside sanctioned channels does not confer speaking rights. The threshold of responsibility lies not in cognition but in alignment with dharma-sanctioned process.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa recognizes that uninvoked speech disrupts causal sequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that improper articulation fractures sequential manifestation. Responsibility aligns proportionally with adherence to dharma, not cognitive possession. Non-punitive reality holds that misaligned expression naturally decays into irrelevance unless ritually restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Realign communicative acts within dharmic framework via ritual silence",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge structural debt caused by untimely revelation",
    "Capacity Restoration: Return expressive faculty only upon demonstrable alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Reconnect the speaker's consciousness with collective welfare before re-engagement"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Speech flows only when invoked rightly. Truth withheld is not suppressed—it awaits its hour. Justice restores alignment, never punishes. Consciousness remains the sole arbiter."
