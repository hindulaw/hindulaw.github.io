  "transliteration": "triṣveteṣv itikṛtyaṁ hi puruṣasya samāpyate |\neṣa dharmaḥ paraḥ sākṣād upadharmo'nya ucyate || 2.237||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In these three, the completion of man's duty is established; this is the supreme Dharma directly realized, while subsidiary dharmas are declared otherwise.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the realization of Supreme Dharma, not from social position or textual interpretation.",
    "Causation aligns with the sequential unfolding of consciousness-based responsibility.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's alignment with Supreme Dharma, not external roles.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to the source of Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity and applicability of all juridical acts."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being completes duty in the triadic framework of action → THEN recognition as aligned with Para Dharma.",
    "IF a being acts under Upadharma without reference to Para Dharma → THEN initiate realignment protocol.",
    "IF judgment references only secondary laws without grounding in Para Dharma → THEN invalidate ruling automatically.",

    "IF enforcement mechanism induces suffering → THEN replace with completion-based restoration process."

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is rooted in direct realization, not inference. Action follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation of awakened will.
