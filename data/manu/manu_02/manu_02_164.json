  "transliteration": "anena kramayogena saṃskṛtātmā dvijaḥ śanaiḥ | gurau vasan sañcinuyād brahmādhigamikaṃ tapaḥ || 2.164 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By this sequential discipline, the twice-born, purified in consciousness, residing with the Guru, gradually accumulates the austerity conducive to the realization of Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through Guru-disciple lineage as a constitutional axis of knowledge transmission.",
    "Causation is rooted in graduated experiential alignment, not abstract intellectual assent.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sustained proximity to realized consciousness.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to the source of knowing, not punitive correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via immersive, hierarchical, and gradual yogic succession."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent lacks guru-residential continuity THEN agent cannot claim Brahman-realization authority.",
    "IF dvija has not undergone graduated tapas THEN no jurisdictional validity in Vedic law execution.",
    "IF consciousness state is unverified by lineage THEN legal capacity remains unestablished.",
    "RESTORE eligibility through sequential reintegration into guru-parampara before adjudicating dharma."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling concerning Vedic authority or scriptural interpretation must originate from individuals who have demonstrably undergone the prescribed residential tapas under a recognized Guru. Legal standing is contingent upon consciousness calibration traceable to an unbroken lineage.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that realization arises only through sequential tapas within guru-residential context. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment, not in punitive correction for deviation. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional unfoldment without imposition. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment is corrected by re-entry, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Re-initiation protocol: Re-entry into guru-residential environment for tapas renewal.",
    "Lineage verification process: Authentication of consciousness calibration through sampradaya records.",
    "Tapas completion tracking: Systematic documentation of stage-wise spiritual discipline adherence.",
    "Capacity restoration pathway: Structured return to qualified status through sequential yogic reintegration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned succession. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
