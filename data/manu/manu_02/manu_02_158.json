  "sanskrit_verse": "यथा षण्ढोऽफलः स्त्रीषु यथा गौर्गवि चाफला । यथा चाज्ञेऽफलं दानं तथा विप्रोऽनृचोऽफलः ॥ २.१५८॥",
  "transliteration": "yathā ṣaṇḍho 'phalaḥ strīṣu yathā gaurgavi cāphalā | yathā cājñe 'phalaṁ dānaṁ tathā vipro 'nṛco 'phalaḥ || 2.158 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As a eunuch is ineffective among women, as a cow is fruitless in bull-like functions, as charity given without knowledge yields no result, likewise, a Brahmin devoid of Vedic recitation has no ritual efficacy.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Dharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation is determined by conscious capacity, not nominal status",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires active alignment with one's svadharma",
    "Restoration logic demands reactivation of dormant spiritual-functional roles",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social positioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_is_brahmin AND NOT performing_vedic_recitation THEN ritual_capacity = null",
    "IF donation_occurs AND donor_lacks_knowledge THEN merit_transfer = false",
    "IF role_holder ≠ functional_capacity THEN societal_integration_status = incomplete",
    "IF consciousness_state ≠ aligned_with_duty THEN legal_effectiveness = suspended",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual or caste-based claims, the Supreme Court must assess actual performance of dharma over nominal identity. A Brahmin who does not perform Vedic duties holds no more ritual authority than a eunuch among women. Legal standing must reflect operational dharma, not inherited title.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that function follows consciousness, not label. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that absence of Vedic engagement leads to loss of ritual potency. Responsibility lies in reclaiming one’s true capacity, not in punitive correction. Non-punitive reality affirms that neglect of duty naturally nullifies efficacy without external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vedic re-engagement program for lapsed Brahmins",
    "Assign mentorship under qualified acharyas for capacity restoration",
    "Implement daily Shruti practice protocol until functional alignment resumes",
    "Establish Svadhyaya Yajna to reactivate dormant ritual consciousness",
    "Declare completion process fulfilled upon demonstrable return to Vedic activity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through realignment of consciousness with svadharma. The law operates beyond punishment, affirming that reality itself enforces accordance with truth. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
