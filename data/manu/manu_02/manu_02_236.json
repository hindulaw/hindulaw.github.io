  "transliteration": "teṣāmanuparodhena pāratryaṁ yadyadācaret |\ntattannivedayettebhyo manovacanakarmabhiḥ || 2.236||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever actions one performs under the influence or obstruction of others, one shall disclose those to them through thought, word, and deed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious integrity, not coercion",
    "Causation includes energetic and mental influence as binding factors",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires full disclosure of induced acts",
    "Restoration logic demands transparency in relational dharmic transactions",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification of mental, verbal, and physical channels"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent performs an act under external influence THEN that act MUST be disclosed to the influencer via MANO-VACHANA-KARMA protocols",
    "IF a being acts under obstruction THEN responsibility is shared proportionally based on causal influence mapping",
    "IF mental alignment with another's intent occurs THEN such alignment MUST be declared through triadic communication",
    "IF any action stems from induced state THEN it SHALL be returned to source for conscious realignment",
    "NO act performed under unseen influence remains unacknowledged in judicial or relational contexts"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, when decisions are influenced by unseen forces—ideological, psychological, or systemic—the ruling entity must declare such influences openly. The court operates beyond punitive judgment and restores dharma by ensuring all involved parties recognize their role in the causal chain.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that induced action arises from misaligned consciousness; thus, correction lies not in punishment but in reestablishing clarity of intent. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how concealed influence distorts truth; therefore, revelation through Mano-Vacana-Karma aligns karmic flow without blame. Proportional responsibility acknowledges shared causality while preserving individual sovereignty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Full disclosure of induced thoughts, words, and deeds to originating source",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of one’s receptive capacity in accepting external influence",

    "Integrity Reintegration: Public or private affirmation of purified intention and future autonomous conduct"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness justice. No punishment arises—only restoration. Reality is non-dual; consciousness alone adjudicates."
