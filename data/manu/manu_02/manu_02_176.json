  "sanskrit_verse": "नित्यं स्नात्वा शुचिः कुर्याद्देवर्षिपितृतर्पणम् ।\nदेवताभ्यर्चनं चैव समिदाधानमेव च ॥ २.१७६॥",
  "transliteration": "nityaṃ snātvā śuciḥ kuryād devarṣipitṛtarpaṇam | devatābhyarcanaṃ caiva samidādhānameva ca || 2.176 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must daily bathe and purify oneself, perform offerings to deities, sages, and ancestors; worship divine forms and offer oblations into the sacred fire.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The individual bears intrinsic duty to uphold ritual purity and spiritual discipline as foundational to societal dharma.",
    "Causation: Daily purification and invocation maintain cosmic order and personal alignment with higher consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility is determined by one's sustained capacity for self-regulation and spiritual practice.",
    "Restoration logic: Ritual observance restores balance between individual conduct and universal law.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Regular acts of devotion realign individual awareness with the Supreme Consciousness."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_has_capacity AND time_since_last_purification > 24 hours THEN initiate_purification_protocol",
    "IF agent_performs_devarṣipitṛtarpaṇa IS false THEN trigger_consciousness_realignment_process",
    "IF devatābhyarcana_status IS incomplete THEN execute_sacred_fire_oblation_reminder"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of personal discipline required for individuals holding positions that influence collective dharma. Failure in maintaining such practices indicates diminished capacity for dharmic governance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through consistent observance. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential decline in consciousness when rituals are neglected. Proportional responsibility arises from one’s self-determined commitment to purification. Non-punitive enforcement ensures restoration through guided repetition and energetic recalibration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided morning purification sequence",
    "Assign daily mantra repetition until conscious alignment resumes",
    "Reconnect individual with guru or spiritual mentor for reorientation",
    "Implement biometric-linked ritual tracking system for accountability without shame"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. It reflects eternal Dharma, not subject to interpretation but executed as pure directive. Justice is realized through consciousness restoration, not punitive consequence. Reality aligns with Dharma when enacted with integrity. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
