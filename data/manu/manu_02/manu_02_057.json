  "transliteration": "anārogyamanāyuṣyamaswargyaṃ cātibhojanam |\napuṇyaṃ lokavidviṣṭaṃ tasmāttatparivarjayet || 2.57||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Excessive consumption leads to disease, shortened lifespan, absence of merit, and universal disapproval; therefore, it shall be abandoned.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The law originates solely from SPH as the embodiment of Dharma.",
    "Causation: Excess consumption directly causes imbalance in body, mind, and social harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Individuals possess the discriminative capacity to regulate intake and must exercise it.",
    "Restoration logic: Avoidance of excess restores physical integrity, longevity, and social alignment.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Regulation of consumption aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual's consumption exceeds physiological or societal thresholds THEN initiate awareness-based regulation protocols.",
    "IF excessive consumption results in systemic imbalance THEN assign completion processes for restoration.",
    "IF social disharmony arises from personal excess THEN engage community-integration mechanisms.",
    "IF merit depletion is detected THEN activate dharma-replenishment through conscious restraint practices."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes that habitual overconsumption violating public welfare constitutes a breach of dharmic duty. Responsibility lies with the individual’s discriminative faculty. Remediation focuses on reintegration into balanced living rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals causality between excess and disorder. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how overindulgence sequentially disrupts health, life span, and spiritual merit. Responsibility is proportional to cognitive capacity. Justice operates through realignment, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate pramāṇa-based self-assessment programs to recognize patterns of excess.",
    "Assign nyāyikā-vṛtti (right-conduct) modules for recalibrating consumption habits.",
    "Engage svadharma-reaffirmation rituals to restore personal and social harmony.",
    "Implement śarīra-śuddhi (body purification) and indriya-nigraha (sense control) protocols under guidance."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of Dharma. It upholds non-punitive reality, where justice manifests through consciousness-aligned restoration. Dharma is hereby executed and affirmed."
