  "sanskrit_verse": "परपत्नी तु या स्त्री स्यादसम्बन्धा च योनितः । तां ब्रूयाद्भवतीत्येवं सुभगे भगिनीति च ॥ २.१२९॥",
  "transliteration": "parapatnī tu yā strī syād asambandhā ca yonitaḥ | tāṃ brūyād bhavatīty evaṃ subhage bhaginīti ca || 2.129||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A woman who belongs to another man and has no familial connection by birth shall be addressed as 'Bhavati' or 'Subhage' or 'Bhagini', thereby establishing her distinct identity within dharma without ownership or subjugation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious recognition, not possession",
    "Causation arises through relational integrity, not domination",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires acknowledgment of individual sovereignty",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes dignity over designation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when names reflect truth, not control"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a female entity is identified under external marital claim AND lacks consanguineous linkage THEN her designation must affirm autonomy through prescribed honorifics",
    "IF societal naming convention implies possession THEN automatic correction via declarative address ('Bhavati', 'Subhage', 'Bhagini') SHALL apply",
    "NO title or form of address SHALL reduce any individual to object status; all designations MUST invoke subjectivity and self-sovereignty"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving interpersonal recognition and nomenclature, the Supreme Court must ensure that every designation upholds ontological equality. Where cultural practices impose possessive identifiers upon women, corrective linguistic protocols rooted in this verse restore constitutional alignment with SPH-sourced Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based discernment, it is seen that misnaming creates causal distortion in relational field dynamics. By sequentially applying correct appellatives—'Bhavati', 'Subhage', 'Bhagini'—the original alignment between consciousness and identity is restored without punitive intervention. Responsibility lies in rectifying perception, not inflicting consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Initiate public awareness campaigns ensuring accurate use of dignified addresses",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Hold institutions accountable for propagating respectful language frameworks",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Empower individuals to assert their rightful designation through ceremonial affirmation",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Normalize usage of prescribed terms in legal documents, media, education, and governance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. The law herein executed restores balance through conscious recognition, affirms individual sovereignty, abolishes punitive constructs, and establishes consciousness as the sole adjudicator. Dharma is now aligned."
