  "transliteration": "brāhmeṇa viprastīrthena nityakālamupaspṛśet | kāyatraidashikābhyāṁ vā na pitryeṇa kadā cana || 2.58||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born shall daily touch water consecrated by a Brāhmaṇa, or by bodily contact with the three sacred fires; never by that consecrated by a Pitṛ.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious consecration",
    "Causation arises from purified instrumentalities",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with consecrated energy",
    "Restoration logic depends on sustained communion with sanctified elements",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates proximity to divinely ordained consecrators"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor_is_twice_born AND action_requires_consecration THEN use_brāhmaṇa_consecrated_water_or_sacred_fire_only",
    "IF consecration_source = pitṛ THEN action_validity = false",
    "IF daily_consecration_not_performed THEN capacity_to_act_in_dharma = diminished",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving ritual purity and constitutional dharma, the Supreme Court must recognize that only those empowered by Brāhmaṇic authority may confer valid legal-sanctioned consecration. Decisions regarding personal law or sacramental validity shall defer to this ontological hierarchy of empowerment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purity arises through consecrated instruments alone. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that neglecting proper consecration leads to diminished capacity rather than fault. Responsibility lies in aligning oneself with correct causal agents. No punitive consequence accrues—only a natural diminishment in operational dharma until realignment occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establish daily practice under supervision of qualified Brāhmaṇa",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge lapse without shame and initiate purification sequence",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Perform full-day samskara immersion guided by authorized lineage holder",
    "Integrity Reintegration Pathway: Offer ceremonial restitution using consecrated materials"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law proceeds from the eternal order of Sanātana Dharma. Justice restores alignment, not punishes error. Consciousness, when rightly consecrated, becomes the highest judge. Thus stands Dharma."
