  "transliteration": "etaddeśaprasūtasya sakāśādagrajanmanaḥ |\nsvaṁ svaṁ caritraṁ śikṣeran pṛthivyāṁ sarvamānavāḥ || 2.20||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All humans on Earth shall learn their respective conduct from the place of their birth and the wisdom of their elder lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the continuum of embodied lineage and spatial origin",
    "Causation is rooted in contextual inheritance and environmental conditioning",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through culturally aligned self-governance",
    "Restoration logic operates via reconnection to ancestral and territorial dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through localized, tradition-rooted behavioral learning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a human resides within a specific cultural-territorial domain THEN that domain's elder-guided ethical framework SHALL govern their conduct acquisition",
    "IF behavioral misalignment occurs THEN restoration MUST involve reintegration with local lineage structures AND NOT external punitive measures",
    "IF capacity for dharmic action is diminished THEN lineage elders MUST activate completion processes rooted in native tradition",
    "IF conflict arises across domains THEN resolution MUST prioritize ancestral integrity over abstract legal codes"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes jurisdictional deference to lineage-rooted ethics where personal conduct is in question. The threshold of responsibility lies in alignment with one’s cultural-territorial matrix, not universalized legal norms. Authority hierarchy recognizes elder wisdom as primary law-source for individual behavior.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through lived ancestral truth and territorial continuity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of character through native guidance. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of disconnection from one’s source lineage. Non-punitive reality rule holds that correction occurs through re-assimilation into original dharmic flow, not through suffering or penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided re-entry into family or community structures bearing traditional knowledge",
    "Assign completion tasks involving service to lineage holders or sacred geography",
    "Activate ritual or ceremonial acknowledgment of misalignment followed by conscious reaffirmation",
    "Establish mentorship under recognized elders until behavioral recalibration is stabilized"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through reconnection to native lineage and territorial truth. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates."
