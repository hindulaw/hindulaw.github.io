  "sanskrit_verse": "क्षरन्ति सर्वा वैदिक्यो जुहोतियजतिक्रियाः ।\nअक्षरं दुष्करं ज्ञेयं ब्रह्म चैव प्रजापतिः ॥ २.८४॥ अक्षरं त्वक्षरं ज्ञेयं",
  "transliteration": "kṣaranti sarvā vaidikyo juhotiyajatikriyāḥ | akṣaraṃ duṣkaraṃ jñeyaṃ brahma caiva prajāpatiḥ || 2.84|| akṣaraṃ tvakṣaraṃ jñeyaṃ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All Vedic rituals of offering and renunciation dissolve in time; that which is imperishable and difficult to realize is Brahman alone, as also Prajapati. The imperishable alone is to be known.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the imperishable source of Brahman",
    "Causation aligns with sequential dissolution of performative acts",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises only upon realization of the imperishable",
    "Restoration logic is grounded in the immutable substratum of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritualistic performance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action is based on perishable ritual THEN it has no enduring jurisprudential validity",
    "IF entity realizes imperishable Brahman THEN all prior performative liabilities are nullified",
    "IF act lacks alignment with consciousness THEN it cannot be adjudicated within Dharma",
    "IF agent operates from akṣara THEN capacity is unlimited and self-restoring"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence based solely on ritualistic or ceremonial law must yield to recognition of the imperishable substratum. Only those acts rooted in akṣara possess judicial standing. Responsibility is recognized only when the actor demonstrates alignment with the imperishable consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that all perishable actions naturally dissolve; therefore, misalignment is not punished but seen as unripe capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential evolution toward realizing akṣara. Proportional responsibility applies only where consciousness is engaged. As reality is non-punitive, error is a completion process toward realization.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Brahmavidyā-based reorientation for misaligned actors",
    "Establish śravaṇa-smaraṇa-vimarśa protocols for consciousness awakening",
    "Deploy Prajāpati-guided integration cycles to restore causal alignment",
    "Activate akṣara-dhāraṇa practices to stabilize non-perishable awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of the imperishable. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
