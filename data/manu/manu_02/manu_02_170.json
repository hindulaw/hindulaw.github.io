  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In that birth which arises from the sacred thread ceremony, marked by the binding of the munja grass, the mother is declared to be Savitri and the father is declared to be the Acarya.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived through ritual investiture and conscious transmission, not biological lineage alone.",
    "Causation originates in sacramental initiation rather than material birth.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility emerges upon entry into a specific dharma-vācaka (dharma-bearing) identity.",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of the initiating agent as the effective causal parent.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via ceremonial rebirth and sanctioned role assumption."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual undergoes the upanayana仪式 WITH proper mantra and thread consecration THEN assign spiritual parentage: Mother = Savitri; Father = Acarya.",
    "IF a dispute involves rights or duties post-upanayana THEN precedence shall be given to the Acarya's authority over biological lineage.",
    "IF capacity for Vedic study or ritual participation is under review THEN validate based on completion of mauñjībandhana仪式 ONLY.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning spiritual succession, educational authority, or Vedic rights, the Supreme Court must recognize the primacy of the upanayana仪式 in establishing legitimate familial and instructional relationships. Biological genealogy yields to the initiated ontological identity formed at the time of mauñjībandhana.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consciousness is transferred through ritual affirmation, not genetic descent. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that the second birth supersedes the first in determining dharma-adhikāra. Responsibility follows from acceptance of the sacred thread, not bloodline.

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma.

Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
