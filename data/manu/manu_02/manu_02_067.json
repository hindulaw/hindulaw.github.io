  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The lawful union of man and woman is a Vedic sacrament that establishes the foundational order of dharma through mutual alignment, sacred service, and conscious cohabitation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Vedic consciousness, not social convention",
    "Causation arises from intentional commitment to shared dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and consent in the union",
    "Restoration logic centers on re-establishing harmonious co-dharma",
