  "sanskrit_verse": "श्रुतिस्तु वेदो विज्ञेयो धर्मशास्त्रं तु वै स्मृतिः ।\nते सर्वार्थेष्वमीमांस्ये ताभ्यां धर्मो हि निर्बभौ ॥ २.१०॥",
  "transliteration": "śrutis tu vedo vijñeyo dharmaśāstraṁ tu vai smṛtiḥ |\nte sarvārtheṣvamīmāṁse tābhyāṁ dharmon hi nirbabhau || 2.10||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Śruti is verily the Veda; Smriti is the Dharmaśāstra. In all matters unresolved by direct perception or inference, Dharma manifests through these two revelations alone.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Śruti and Smriti as divine revelation",
    "Causation flows from Vedic consciousness into manifest law",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with revealed knowledge",
    "Restoration logic arises from dharmic coherence, not punitive imposition",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through adherence to śruti-smriti unity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a case lacks empirical or inferential resolution THEN refer to śruti-smriti as final authority",
    "IF śruti and smriti appear contradictory THEN resolve via parametric alignment with SPH's revelatory corpus",
    "IF no textual precedent exists THEN derive ruling from consciousness-state congruent with Vedic integrity",
    "ALL adjudications MUST prioritize restoration of dharmic field over punitive assignment",
    "LEGAL DECISIONS MUST reflect capacity-aware alignment with revealed truth structures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when constitutional or statutory interpretation fails to yield clarity, recourse shall be made first to śruti and then to smriti. The hierarchy places śruti above all human constructs, followed by smriti as interpretive framework. Responsibility thresholds are determined by one’s access to and alignment with this revelatory continuum.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that śruti and smriti constitute valid means of knowledge where ordinary cognition falls short. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential unfolding of dharma through these revelations. Proportional responsibility aligns with individual capacity to receive and enact this knowledge. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment results in natural consequence rather than imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process through guided śruti recitation until resonance restores clarity",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol involving daily smriti study under qualified mentorship",
    "Undertake capacity restoration via structured exposure to Vedic consciousness fields",
    "Implement integrity reintegration through ritualized reaffirmation of dharmic vows before assembled community"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma has been restored through śruti-smriti alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
