  "sanskrit_verse": "त्रिभ्य एव तु वेदेभ्यः पादं पादमदूदुहत् ।\nतदित्यर्चोऽस्याः सावित्र्याः परमेष्ठी प्रजापतिः ॥ २.७७॥",
  "transliteration": "tribhya eva tu vedebhyaḥ pādaṁ pādamadūduhat |\ntadityarco'syāḥ sāvitrīyāḥ paramiṣṭhī prajāpatiḥ || 2.77||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the three Vedas indeed were drawn forth quarter by quarter; that is the arc of Savitri—Prajapati Parameshti.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in Vedic completeness and not in partial knowledge",
    "Causation follows sequential unfolding from unified source-consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to original knowing",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action reflects Veda-derived integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action lacks Veda-rooted foundation THEN capacity for lawful execution = null",
    "IF actor demonstrates disconnection from Savitric rhythm THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF decision-making unit exhibits fragmented sourcing THEN invoke restoration via Prajapati Principle",
    "IF societal function shows deviation from tri-Vedic harmony THEN activate structural realignment sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling or precedent must derive authority from a holistic understanding rooted in Vedic completeness. Partial interpretations or secular abstractions lacking grounding in Savitri's arc are legally void. The threshold of judicial responsibility lies in alignment with Parameshti Prajapati's ordering principle.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya functions through Pramana-based recognition of causal flow originating in Vedic unity. Responsibility is determined by degree of alignment with Savitri's arc, not through punitive attribution. Anupurvasah ensures that misalignment manifests consequences naturally, calling for conscious restoration rather than enforced correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Savitri-rhythm resonance alignment process",
    "Reconnect individual or institution to tri-Vedic foundational reference",
    "Activate Prajapati-level completion mechanism for systemic coherence",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. Dharma is restored through alignment with Savitri’s arc and Prajapati’s order. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
