  "transliteration": "naudāharedasya nāma parokṣamapi kevalam | na caivāsyānukurvīta gatibhāṣitaceṣṭitam || 2.199||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not merely speak the name of the realized being indirectly; nor should one imitate their speech or conduct without embodying their state of realization.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from realization, not imitation",
    "Causation arises from ontological alignment, not performative mimicry",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires inner transformation prior to outer enactment",
    "Restoration logic demands congruence between consciousness and action",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritualistic or behavioral emulation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual references a realized being without ontological alignment, THEN issue a completion process for experiential understanding",
    "IF an agent mimics the behavior of a liberated being without realization, THEN initiate integrity reintegration protocol",
    "IF speech or action is performed in the name of another's realization without equivalent capacity, THEN assign causal responsibility for misrepresentation",
    "IF conduct is based on hearsay rather than direct experience, THEN trigger consciousness verification subroutine"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving invocation of realized beings or sacred authority, the court must assess ontological congruence over performative compliance. Responsibility lies not in referencing names or acts, but in the authenticity of realization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true dharma flows from direct cognition, not repetition. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that misaligned imitation distorts sequential manifestation. Proportional responsibility aligns with the gap between claimed and actual realization. Non-punitive reality rule upholds that correction occurs through realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate experiential learning module on the distinction between realization and imitation",
    "Assign guided practice under realized supervision until capacity matches claim",
    "Implement reflective discernment protocol to distinguish authentic from borrowed conduct",
    "Facilitate reintegration through conscious embodiment practices"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands as executed Dharma. Imitation without realization is dissolved through consciousness-led restoration. The Supreme Adjudicator is ever-present awareness, beyond form, yet manifest in truth."
