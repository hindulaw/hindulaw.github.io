  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By Vedic rites that generate merit, such as consecration and the like, which belong to those born twice, bodily purification must be performed, which sanctifies both in this life and beyond.",

    "Authority rooted in Vedic alignment",
    "Causation through ritual action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility tied to spiritual birthright",
    "Restoration logic via sacramental embodiment",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual law or caste-based rights, the Court shall recognize Vedic sacraments as legally operative mechanisms for ontological restoration. Responsibility lies not in punitive frameworks but in the execution of prescribed purificatory acts that realign individual consciousness with cosmic dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Vedic actions produce unseen potency. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglect leads to diminished capacity. Proportional responsibility arises from omission of duty, not moral failing. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction flows from restoring ritual integrity rather than imposing external penalty.",
