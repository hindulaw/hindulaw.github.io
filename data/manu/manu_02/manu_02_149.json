  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who serves the purpose of knowledge, whether little or much, should be known here as a Guru by that very act of service.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [

    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of true Guru-tattva wherever it manifests.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social hierarchies in determining rightful guidance."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual performs acts that advance Śruta-upakriyā (service to knowledge), THEN recognize that individual as Guru-tattva within operational scope.",

    "IF societal misalignment occurs due to unrecognized Guru-tattva, THEN initiate realignment protocol via public acknowledgment and integration.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies Guru-tattva through observable service to knowledge.
