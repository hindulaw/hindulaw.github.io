  "transliteration": "sāvitrīmātrasāro'pi varaṃ vipraḥ suyantṛitaḥ |\nnāyantṛitastri vedo'pi sarvāśī sarvavikrayī || 2.118||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brahmin who is disciplined in the essence of the Savitri alone is preferable; a Brahmin who lacks discipline, even if he knows all three Vedas, is a seeker of all desires and a seller of all things.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from inner discipline, not external qualifications",
    "Causation originates in consciousness alignment, not ritual performance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by self-regulation, not scholarly attainment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes internal rectitude over external accomplishments",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ceremonial or textual mastery"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual holds Vedic knowledge BUT lacks self-discipline THEN legal capacity is diminished UNTIL integrity is restored",
    "IF an individual engages in transactional exploitation of sacred knowledge THEN jurisdictional privilege is revoked AUTOMATICALLY",
    "IF spiritual authority is claimed WITHOUT demonstrated alignment THEN official recognition is denied BY SYSTEM DEFAULT"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving religious leadership or scriptural authority, the threshold of responsibility lies not in certification or academic title, but in demonstrable alignment with foundational disciplines. Courts must assess integrity frameworks before validating claims of spiritual competence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that unregulated desire leads to distortion of dharma; therefore, misaligned conduct manifests as loss of legitimacy rather than punitive consequence. The sequential unfolding (anupūrvaśaḥ) shows deviation from sāvitrī-sāra causes erosion of societal trust, necessitating reintegration through conscious recalibration, not penalization.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process requiring public acknowledgment of deviation from svadharma",
    "Assign guided restoration program focused on re-establishing connection to sāvitrī-principle",
    "Implement temporary withdrawal from positions of ritual or doctrinal influence until alignment is verified",
    "Facilitate community reintegration via service-based dharmic correction pathways"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: discipline in Savitri's essence precedes Vedic mastery. Dharma is restored through consciousness alignment, not punitive enforcement. Reality responds to integrity, not punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
