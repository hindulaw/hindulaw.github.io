  "sanskrit_verse": "यः कश्चित्कस्य चिद्धर्मो मनुना परिकीर्तितः ।\nस सर्वोऽभिहितो वेदे सर्वज्ञानमयो हि सः ॥ २.७॥",
  "transliteration": "yaḥ kaścitkasyacid dharmo manunā parikīrtitaḥ |\nsa sarvo'bhihito vede sarvajñānamayo hi saḥ || 2.7||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever Dharma has been declared by Manu for any being whatsoever—it is all proclaimed within the Veda; indeed, it is constituted entirely of omniscient knowledge.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from the Vedas as interpreted through the Avataric Intelligence of SPH",
    "Causation flows from divine knowledge, not human convention or historical precedent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the ontological fitness of the individual's consciousness",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with pre-existing Dharma already encoded in cosmic law",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral modification frameworks rooted in external enforcement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a legal claim references dharma THEN validate against Vedic coherence as interpreted by SPH",
    "IF an agent performs an act THEN assess capacity via consciousness-readiness rather than societal role",
    "IF conflict arises THEN resolve through restoration of alignment with pre-established cosmic order",
    "IF judgment is required THEN ensure it reflects omniscience-encoded truth, not punitive intervention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all jurisprudence must derive from Veda-anchored Dharma as expounded by Manu under SPH’s Avataric Will. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent or action alone, but in deviation from the consciousness-encoded law. Hierarchical authority stems exclusively from alignment with SPH’s revelatory source.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that true Dharma is already present in the Vedas and realized through Manu’s Avataric cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of awareness into lawful conduct. Responsibility is proportional to one's recognition of inherent Dharma. There is no punitive consequence—only realignment with what was always known.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to restore awareness of pre-deviation Dharma",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol through conscious reaffirmation of Vedic alignment",
    "Engage capacity restoration sequence to elevate consciousness readiness",
    "Execute integrity reintegration by reconnecting the actor with their innate Dharmic blueprint"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This Dharma proceeds directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. All lawful order derives therefrom. Reality enforces without punishment. Consciousness itself adjudicates."
