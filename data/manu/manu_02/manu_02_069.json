  "transliteration": "upanīyaṃ guruḥ śiṣyaṃ śikṣayet śaucam āditaḥ |\nācāram agnikāryaṃ ca sandhyopāsanam eva ca || 2.69||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Guru, having initiated the disciple, shall instruct in purity first, followed by conduct, fire rituals, and the practice of Sandhya worship.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from initiation and spiritual competence",
    "Causation originates in sequential experiential learning",
    "Capacity-based responsibility begins with internal purification",
    "Restoration logic requires foundational discipline before higher practices",
    "Consciousness alignment proceeds through graduated ritual and ethical instruction"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF disciple is initiated THEN Guru MUST commence instruction with śauca (purity)",
    "IF śauca is established THEN proceed to ācāra (conduct)",
    "IF ācāra is stabilized THEN introduce agnikārya (fire ritual)",
    "IF agnikārya is integrated THEN enable sandhyopāsana (twilight worship)",
    "IF sequence is violated THEN realign process through completion protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating spiritual lineage or guru-disciple disputes, the Court must recognize that authority derives from proper sequential initiation and pedagogical fidelity. Legal standing arises only when foundational disciplines have been transmitted in order—beginning with purity—and not merely through ceremonial investiture.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that improper sequencing leads to defective realization; anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional unfolding of capacity without coercion; corrective action restores flow rather than inflicts penalty; reality remains non-punitive as misalignment is viewed as incomplete integration, not transgression.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiation validation protocol to verify śauca commencement",
    "Disciple readiness assessment for ācāra transmission",
    "Ritual integrity audit for agnikārya execution",
    "Worship consistency monitoring for sandhyopāsana establishment",
    "Sequential reintegration pathway for disrupted progressions"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through ordered spiritual education. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
