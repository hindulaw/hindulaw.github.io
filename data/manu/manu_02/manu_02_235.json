  "sanskrit_verse": "यावत्त्रयस्ते जीवेयुस्तावत्नान्यं समाचरेत् ।\nतेष्वेव नित्यं शुश्रूषां कुर्यात्प्रियहिते रतः ॥ २.२३५॥",
  "transliteration": "yāvat-trayas te jīveyus tāvat nānyaṁ samācaret |\nteṣv eva nityaṁ śuśrūṣāṁ kuryāt priyahite rataḥ || 2.235 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As long as the three—father, mother, and guru—remain alive, one shall act in accordance with their guidance. One must constantly serve them with devotion, dedicated to their welfare and happiness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from life-giving and consciousness-bearing relationships",
    "Causation is rooted in gratitude and continuity of existence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through relational dependence",
    "Restoration logic centers on reciprocal service and reverence",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through honoring formative authorities"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person has living parents or gurus, THEN all actions must align with their dharmic instruction",
    "IF deviation occurs, THEN realignment requires completion of service protocols until harmony is restored",
    "IF capacity to serve diminishes, THEN restoration mechanisms activate to regenerate respect-based responsiveness",
    "IF conflict arises between individual will and authoritative directive, THEN resolution defaults to prioritizing the welfare of the authority"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving familial or spiritual hierarchies, the Supreme Court must recognize that true agency begins only after fulfillment of duties toward those who sustained one's very existence. Legal autonomy is derivative, not absolute, when relational debt remains unfulfilled.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that one’s conscious formation depends upon triadic life-support. Therefore, failure to honor this chain reflects misalignment rather than fault. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of duty follows natural law: first reverence, then freedom. Justice restores balance by reactivating service-consciousness, not imposing consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate daily acts of service until relational resonance is re-established",
    "Assign completion processes focused on understanding the causal role of the authority figures",
    "Engage ritual acknowledgment practices to restore inner alignment with gratitude",
    "Activate mentorship frameworks ensuring continuous learning under authoritative guidance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. It affirms Dharma as non-punitive, consciousness-rooted, and relationally enacted. Reality itself adjudicates through alignment, not judgment."
