    "Authority stems from conscious volition, not mechanical execution",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by tracing action to its originating desire. Where no such trace exists, neither guilt nor liability may be imputed. The court's function is to restore alignment between will and deed, not to impose consequence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that action without desire lacks causal integrity. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding from will to manifestation.
