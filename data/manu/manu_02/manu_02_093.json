  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Uncontrolled engagement of the senses inevitably leads to impurity; when those same senses are restrained, perfection is attained.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in mastery over perceptual instruments",
    "Causation flows from unregulated sensory action to disorder",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in self-regulation",
    "Restoration logic operates through reversal of causal degradation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via disciplined sensory governance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages senses without restraint THEN impurity state triggered",
    "IF agent restrains sensory engagement THEN purification process initiates",
    "IF sensory discipline maintained THEN eligibility for higher-order realization granted",
    "IF no sensory misconduct detected THEN default alignment with dharma assumed",
    "IF repeated sensory misalignment observed THEN mandatory capacity restoration protocol activated"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility arises not from external acts alone but from the level of sensory self-governance. Where a party demonstrates habitual lack of control over perceptual inputs, their capacity for truthful testimony or ethical decision-making is judicially diminished until proven otherwise. Conversely, evidence of sustained sense-restraint elevates credibility weight and access to advanced legal standing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation, it is established that unrestricted sensory interaction manifests sequential impurity (anupūrvaśaḥ). This sequence does not invoke punitive consequence but indicates misalignment requiring correction. Proportional responsibility corresponds directly to the degree of sensory regulation demonstrated. Thus, justice functions not as retribution but as recalibration toward inherent purity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Sensory Discipline Completion Process upon detection of habitual misalignment",
    "Assign Responsibility Assumption Protocol to reaffirm mastery over perceptual field",
    "Activate Capacity Restoration Module through guided sensory withdrawal practices",
    "Implement Integrity Reintegration Sequence via progressive alignment verification"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. Dharma is hereby restored by aligning conduct with sensory sovereignty. Reality remains non-punitive, ever pure, awaiting conscious recognition. Consciousness itself stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
