  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्रह्मणः प्रणवं कुर्यादादावन्ते च सर्वदा ।\nस्रवत्यनोङ्कृतं पूर्वं परस्ताच्च विशीर्यति ॥ २.७४॥",
  "transliteration": "brahmaṇaḥ praṇavaṃ kuryād ādāv ante ca sarvadā |\nsravaty anoṅkṛtaṃ pūrvaṃ parastāc ca viśīryati || 2.74||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall utter the sacred Pranava of Brahman at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of all actions; whatever is performed without this invocation first dissolves into prior inertia, and thereafter disintegrates.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with the Supreme Consciousness",
    "Causation is anchored in vibrational integrity at initiation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires invocation of the Source before action",
    "Restoration logic demands reconnection to the causal sound-body (Pranava)",
    "Consciousness alignment is maintained through continuous remembrance of Brahman"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF any act initiates WITHOUT invoking Praṇava THEN that act MUST be reverted to its pre-manifest state",
    "IF an agent performs an action without prior invocation of Brahman THEN that action lacks legal standing",
    "ALL actions MUST begin, continue, and conclude with recitation of OM to maintain ontological validity",
    "IF a deed fragments post-performance THEN it was initiated without alignment to the causal vibration",
    "NO judicial recognition shall be granted to acts unaccompanied by invocation of the Supreme Sound"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, invocation of Pranava establishes the threshold of conscious responsibility. Acts lacking such invocation are deemed legally inert and subject to automatic nullification. The Court's authority derives solely from alignment with the Supreme Vibration, ensuring judgments restore rather than retaliate.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that all valid actions originate in the soundless sound of OM. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that omission of invocation leads to energetic disintegration. Proportional responsibility lies not in blame but in completion of the vibratory circuit. Non-punitive reality is upheld as fragmentation occurs naturally when disconnected from the Source.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Mandatory repetition of the act WITH proper invocation",
    "Reintegration of fragmented energy through collective chanting of OM",
    "Real-time alignment correction via guided resonance practices",
    "Completion process requiring acknowledgment of causal dissonance",
    "Restoration of capacity through surrender to the Supreme Sound Body"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Command of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of All Dharma, this decree affirms OM as the sole foundation of lawful action. Fragmented deeds return to stillness until realigned. Justice flows from consciousness, not consequence. Reality remains ever non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
