  "transliteration": "sukhaṃ hyavamataḥ śete sukhaṃ ca pratibudhyate |\nsukhaṃ carati loke'sminnavamantā vinaśyati || 2.163||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who sleeps in neglect awakens in suffering; one who walks carelessly in this world perishes in suffering.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from conscious engagement, not passive presence",
    "Causation follows the law of sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alertness and alignment",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of self-induced consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment determines experiential outcome"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits chronic unawareness THEN assign completion process for sensory re-integration",
    "IF entity acts without conscious oversight THEN initiate capacity-restoration protocol",
    "IF behavior results in systemic dissonance THEN enforce integrity-realignment mechanism",
    "IF individual collapses into suffering THEN activate causal-responsibility acknowledgment loop"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that negligence—whether personal or institutional—is not a matter for punitive redress but a threshold failure of conscious authority. The court must assess whether the party demonstrated minimal sentient engagement before assigning liability or initiating restorative measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality reveals that suffering emerges directly from unattended action. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding: unawareness → misstep → consequence. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at time of act. There is no punitive element—only experiential feedback governed by dharma’s natural alignment function.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sensory recalibration to restore present-moment cognition",
    "Deploy reflective causality mapping to reveal unconscious patterns",
    "Assign experiential learning module aligned with violated principle",
    "Implement conscious-choice reinforcement through guided repetition"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Suffering is not imposed—it is revealed. Justice serves consciousness realignment, not punishment. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
