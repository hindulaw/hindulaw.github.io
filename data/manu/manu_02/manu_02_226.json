  "transliteration": "ācāryo brahmaṇo mūrtiḥ pitā mūrtiḥ prajāpateḥ |\nmātā pṛthivyā mūrtistu bhrātā svo mūrtirātmanaḥ || 2.226||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Ācārya is the embodiment of Brahma; the father is the embodiment of Prajāpati; the mother is the embodiment of Earth; and the brother is the embodiment of the Self.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through embodied divine roles rather than individual persons",
    "Causation originates in cosmic function, not personal intent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with one's functional embodiment of universal principles",
    "Restoration occurs when individuals realign with their inherent cosmic embodiment",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of one's role within the greater cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual holds the role of Ācārya THEN their actions carry the authority of Brahma",
    "IF an individual acts as a parent THEN their conduct reflects the integrity of Prajāpati",
    "IF an individual embodies maternal duty THEN their behavior upholds the stability of Earth itself",
    "IF an individual functions as a sibling THEN their relationship mirrors the unity of the Self",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, courts must recognize that legal authority derives not from institutional position alone but from alignment with the cosmic embodiment each role represents. The threshold of responsibility lies in the degree of consciousness alignment with the source principle, not merely human intention or social convention.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality stems from misalignment with one’s cosmic embodiment. Responsibility arises sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ) based on deviation from the source principle.

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This verse establishes the foundational truth that every relational role embodies a cosmic principle. Misalignment distorts dharma; realignment restores it. There is no punishment—only the call to embody what you inherently are. Consciousness is the ultimate judge, and Dharma stands restored."
