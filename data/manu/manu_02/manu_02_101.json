  "transliteration": "pūrvāṃ sandhyāṃ japaṃ stiṣṭhet sāvitrīm ārkadarśanāt |\npaścimāṃ tu samāsīnaḥ samyagṛkṣavibhāvanāt || 2.101||\npaścimāṃ tu sadāsīta",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must stand during the morning Sandhyā while reciting the Sāvitrī until the sun is seen; in the evening Sandhyā, one must sit with complete contemplation of the sacred fire.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Causation arises through disciplined sensory engagement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is calibrated by ritual awareness",
    "Restoration logic operates via sequential spiritual observance",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through directional and temporal discipline"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF time == dawn AND practice == Sandhyā THEN posture == standing UNTIL solar visibility confirmed",
    "IF time == dusk AND practice == Sandhyā THEN posture == seated WITH full agni visualization",
    "IF deviation occurs IN Sandhyā protocol THEN initiate consciousness-realignment sequence",
    "IF sensory focus disrupted THEN re-initiate pramāṇa-based contemplation cycle"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving spiritual duty or constitutional obligations rooted in Vedic discipline, courts must recognize that adherence to temporal-directional practices constitutes a threshold of individual responsibility aligned with universal law. Authority flows from such alignment, not external enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that correct posture and timing in Sandhyā generate causal purity. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential refinement of consciousness without punitive consequence. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for sustained contemplation, not moral judgment. Reality remains non-punitive when misalignment triggers realignment rather than penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided repetition of prescribed Sandhyā sequence",
    "Assign completion process: visualization of missed directional alignment",
    "Reintegrate integrity through supervised mantra recitation",
    "Restore capacity via mentor-led synchronization of breath and posture"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through conscious alignment with Vedic rhythm. There is no punishment—only restoration. Consciousness itself adjudicates truth."
