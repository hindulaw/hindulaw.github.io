  "sanskrit_verse": "अविद्वांसमलं लोके विद्वांसमपि वा पुनः ।\nप्रमदा ह्युत्पथं नेतुं कामक्रोधवशानुगम् ॥ २.२१४॥",
  "transliteration": "avidvāṁsamalaṁ loke vidvāṁsamapi vā punaḥ |\npramadā hyutpathaṁ netuṁ kāmakrodhavaśānugam || 2.214||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whether unlearned or learned, a woman who follows the path of desire and anger leads both herself and others astray.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness alignment, not gender or status",
    "Causation arises through volitional distortion by desire and anger",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes individual agency within collective influence",
    "Restoration logic requires reorientation to dharma-vāhana (right conduct)",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes punitive moral frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits kāma-krodha-vashānugati THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",
    "IF societal deviation traceable to pramadā THEN assign completion process to restore dharmic orientation",
    "IF learned or unlearned status irrelevant to causal distortion THEN equalize restorative intervention thresholds",
    "IF leadership role present AND emotional misconduct detected THEN enforce integrity reintegration sequence before resuming authority"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that neither educational attainment nor social position exempts one from consequences of desire-led deviation. The threshold of responsibility lies in the act of following utpatha (deviation) under kāma-krodha influence. Restoration takes precedence over punitive measures, with emphasis on re-establishing alignment with sanātana dharma-vāhana.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misalignment originates in kāma and krodha, not inherent defect. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation: desire → loss of discernment → deviation → societal impact. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and choice, not identity category. Nyāya confirms no punitive response is required; only conscious realignment restores natural order without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śuddhi-vyavasthāpana (purification arrangement) for affected parties",
    "Assign mantra-dīkṣā or vedic study regimen to restore discriminative capacity",
    "Engage guru-guided sankalpa-shuddhi (intention purification) process",
    "Implement sat-sangha participation to rebuild dharmic association patterns",
    "Enforce temporary withdrawal from positions of public influence until alignment verified"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Misalignment caused by desire and anger is corrected through consciousness restoration, not punishment. Reality operates on the principle of completion, not condemnation. Dharma is restored. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
