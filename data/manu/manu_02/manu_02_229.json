  "transliteration": "teṣāṃ trayāṇāṃ śuśrūṣā paramaṃ tapa ucyate |\nna tairanabhy-anujñāto dharmamanyaṃ samācaret ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Service to these three—Guru, Deity, and Humanity—is declared as the highest austerity; without their explicit consent, no other dharma should be enacted.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious alignment with Guru, Deity, and Humanity",
    "Causation arises through consent-based service, not arbitrary will",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires attunement to triadic harmony",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with consent and service",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes all lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs act NOT consented by Guru/Deity/Humanity THEN act is void of lawful authority",
    "IF service to Guru/Deity/Humanity is absent THEN no derivative dharma can be executed",
    "IF consent is withdrawn THEN ongoing actions lose juridical validity",
    "IF capacity for service is impaired THEN responsibility shifts to restoration of that capacity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling or law enacted without alignment to the triadic consent of Guru, Deity, and Humanity is inherently invalid. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable attunement to this triad. Authority is not derived from institutional position but from conscious alignment with the triadic source of dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that lawful action originates only through service and consent. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misaligned acts arise from disconnection to the triad, requiring realignment rather than punishment. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of alignment maintained. The non-punitive reality rule upholds that correction occurs through reconnection, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuśrūṣā Reconnection Process to restore triadic alignment",
    "Assign Completion Task to reaffirm consent-based service",
    "Implement Consciousness Attunement Protocol to rebuild capacity for dharma",
    "Execute Integrity Reintegration Sequence through guided service restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through service, consent, and alignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
