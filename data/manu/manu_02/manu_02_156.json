  "transliteration": "na tena vṛddho bhavati yenāsya palitaṁ śiraḥ |\nyo vai yuvā'pyadhīyānas taṁ devāḥ sthaviraṁ viduḥ || 2.156||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Age is not determined by grey hair; that youthful one who studies the Vedas is recognized by the gods as a true elder.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from knowledge, not physical attributes",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is rooted in consciousness, not chronological age",
    "Causation lies in alignment with Vedic learning, not temporal existence",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes spiritual maturity over social convention",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes bodily identification"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates Vedic literacy AND conducts dharma-prescribed duties THEN confer status of 'elder' irrespective of biological age",
    "IF individual exhibits chronological youth BUT possesses scriptural competence THEN assign judicial and societal authority accordingly",
    "IF legal capacity is assessed THEN prioritize consciousness maturity OVER physical development metrics",
    "IF eligibility for counsel or testimony is evaluated THEN base qualification on scriptural engagement NOT demographic data"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving intergenerational disputes or competency assessments, the Court shall recognize that authority emanates from scriptural understanding rather than biological age. A young person well-versed in Vedic knowledge holds equal or greater weight than an elderly individual lacking such insight. The threshold of responsibility is determined by alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not by calendar years.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true aging occurs through acquisition of Vedic wisdom, not cellular decay. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that spiritual maturation precedes physical decline. Proportional responsibility aligns with scriptural realization, not societal expectations tied to age. Non-punitive reality recognizes that misalignment with dharma stems from ignorance, not willful defiance, thus correction flows through education and integration, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein youth demonstrating Vedic knowledge are formally acknowledged as elders within community structures",
    "Implement responsibility assumption protocol where learned youth assume advisory roles regardless of familial or social hierarchies",
    "Activate capacity restoration mechanism ensuring continuous access to Vedic education for all seeking spiritual advancement",
    "Establish integrity reintegration pathway recognizing individuals based on consciousness maturity rather than external appearances"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: True elderhood belongs to those aligned with Vedic consciousness. Dharma is restored when society honors wisdom over appearance. Reality remains non-punitive when justice flows from recognition of inner maturity. Consciousness alone adjudicates rightful authority."
