  "transliteration": "brahma yastvananujñātamadhīyānādavāpnuyāt |\nsa brahmasteyasaṃyukto narakaṃ pratipadyate || 2.116||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who studies the Veda without permission commits a theft of sacred knowledge and incurs a fall into degradation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Access to sacred knowledge requires explicit authorization from competent spiritual authority.",
    "Causation: Unauthorized study disrupts the lawful transmission lineage of Vedic wisdom.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The capacity to receive and transmit Vedic knowledge is conditional upon sanctioned initiation.",
    "Restoration logic: Misuse of sacred knowledge necessitates realignment with rightful channels of learning.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Sacred texts function as instruments of consciousness elevation only when accessed through proper spiritual alignment."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent accesses Vedic scripture WITHOUT prior authorization FROM recognized spiritual authority THEN access is classified as unauthorized.",
    "IF access is unauthorized THEN system MUST initiate completion protocol for restoration of rightful knowledge flow.",
    "IF agent demonstrates readiness AND seeks reauthorization THEN reintegration pathway MUST be activated.",
    "IF violation occurs DUE TO negligence in gatekeeping THEN custodian accountability protocol SHALL be initiated."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving misuse or unauthorized dissemination of sacred knowledge, the Supreme Court shall assess whether due process was followed in granting access. The threshold of responsibility lies both on the seeker and the custodian of knowledge. Restoration involves revoking improper access and initiating reauthorization procedures aligned with dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unauthorized acquisition of Vedic knowledge breaks the causal chain of legitimate succession. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how improper access leads to distortion of consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of deviation from authorized transmission. The outcome is not punitive but reflects natural consequence—degradation results from disconnection from source integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Revoke all unauthorized access and redirect to sanctioned pathways.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require acknowledgment of misalignment and commitment to rectify.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Initiate purification and preparation processes before re-granting eligibility.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Facilitate supervised re-entry into Vedic study under qualified guidance."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms that Dharma operates exclusively through authorized consciousness conduits. Justice serves restoration, not punishment. Reality aligns through conscious reintegration. Brahman alone adjudicates."
