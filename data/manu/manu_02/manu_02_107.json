  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving scholarly or spiritual authority, the Court must recognize that authentic scriptural mastery establishes inherent capacity for dharmic influence.

The threshold of responsibility correlates directly with the integrity of scriptural absorption.",
