    "Authority diminishes with relational distance",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of relational authenticity determines adhikāra to intervene. Courts must assess the duration and depth of connection between parties before asserting jurisdiction. Where bonds are innate or cultivated through sustained dharma-aligned interaction, intervention assumes a restorative posture. Authority is not imposed but recognized based on existing dharmic alignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from conscious continuity. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, consequences arise naturally from disruption of relational harmony. Responsibility is proportional to the closeness of shared dharma. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that misalignment resolves through recognition and restoration, not through external penalty.",
