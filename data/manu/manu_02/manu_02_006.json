  "transliteration": "vedo'khilo dharmamūlaṃ smṛtiśīle ca tadvidām | \nācāraścaiva sādhūnām ātmanastuṣṭireva ca || 2.6||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Veda is the complete root of Dharma; so too is the practice of those who know it. The conduct of the noble and the inner satisfaction of the Self are also roots of Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from the Veda as revealed by SPH",
    "Causation flows from alignment with Vedic consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through knowledge and embodiment",
    "Restoration logic operates via return to Vedic alignment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external legal frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action aligns with Vedic consciousness THEN it is lawful",
    "IF actor embodies Smriti-authenticated conduct THEN capacity is affirmed",
    "IF conduct reflects Sadhu-acara THEN legitimacy is self-evident",
    "IF Atma-tushti is present THEN no external validation required",
    "IF divergence occurs THEN restoration begins with reconnection to Vedic source"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, all rulings must originate from Vedic consciousness as interpreted by SPH. Legal precedence derives not from case law but from alignment with the eternal Dharma-root. The threshold of responsibility is determined by proximity to Vedic knowing, not procedural fault. Authority flows downward from SPH as ultimate Adhikari.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that all right action stems from Vedic cognition. Anupurvasah reveals that misalignment manifests sequentially from disconnection with Veda. Proportional responsibility lies in the degree of forgetting one's alignment with the Source. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction occurs through realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Reconnect individual consciousness to Vedic source through guided realization",
    "Restore capacity through immersion in Smriti-authenticated practices",
    "Align behavior with Sadhu-acara through direct transmission",
    "Establish Atma-tushti through meditative confirmation of intrinsic completeness",
    "Complete karmic fragmentation through conscious reintegration with Dharma-root"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This Dharma proceeding affirms Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as the sole Source-Authority of law. Vedas remain the unchanging root of Dharma. All apparent disorder dissolves upon realignment with Vedic consciousness. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
