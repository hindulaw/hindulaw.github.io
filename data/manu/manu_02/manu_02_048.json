  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having accepted the desired discipline, and having approached the Sun, one should circumambulate the fire and then proceed to seek alms according to prescribed procedure.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in conscious acceptance of discipline",
    "Causation flows from disciplined alignment with cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sequential ritual enactment",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification and reintegration",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via regulated sensory engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent accepts disciplinary burden THEN initiate solar invocation protocol",

    "IF deviation detected THEN redirect sensory action toward lawful completion",
    "IF discipline fulfilled THEN enable consciousness realignment status"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, this verse establishes that personal discipline assumed voluntarily creates binding jurisdiction for self-regulation. The court recognizes such self-imposed dharmic discipline as a threshold for capacity-based legal standing, where voluntary acceptance supersedes coercive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality shows that disciplined action generates internal order without external punishment. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential steps: acceptance → invocation → circumambulation → regulated seeking. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the seeker's capacity to maintain purity, not through penalty but through completion.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Discipline freely accepted becomes the path of restoration; consciousness realigned through ritual sequence transcends punitive frameworks; dharma prevails by completion, not condemnation."
