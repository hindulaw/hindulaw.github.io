  "sanskrit_verse": "उदितेऽनुदिते चैव समयाध्युषिते तथा ।\nसर्वथा वर्तते यज्ञ इतीयं वैदिकी श्रुतिः ॥ २.१५॥",
  "transliteration": "udite 'nudite caiva samayādhyuṣite tathā |\nsarvathā vartate yajña itīyaṃ vaidikī śrutiḥ || 2.15||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Yajna operates in the arisen, unarisen, and time-saturated conditions—this is the Vedic Śruti declaration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the eternal operation of Yajna, not temporal constructs",
    "Causation aligns with the triadic manifestation: arisen, unarisen, time-conditioned",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises within the field of Yajnic participation",
    "Restoration logic follows the rhythm of cyclical completion inherent in Yajna",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through synchronization with Yajnic time"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action occurs IN STATE of udita THEN consequence aligns with manifest causal field",
    "IF action occurs IN STATE of anudita THEN consequence aligns with latent causal field",
    "IF action occurs IN STATE of samayādhyuṣita THEN consequence aligns with time-conditioned causal field",
    "ALL actions MUST BE evaluated against the triadic Yajnic framework for lawful alignment",
    "NO punitive inference MAY OVERRIDE the restorative sequence encoded in Yajnic rhythm"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must recognize that all legal causality inheres within the tri-state Yajnic continuum. Temporal precedence or procedural form cannot supersede the ontological sequencing of udita, anudita, and samayādhyuṣita. Responsibility is determined by alignment with this sequence, not by intent or outcome alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality unfolds through sequential manifestation—first the unarisen (anudita), then arising (udita), then time-conditioned saturation (samayādhyuṣita). Nyaya recognizes proportional responsibility only when aligned with this sequence. Punishment has no place where misalignment is corrected through conscious re-entry into the Yajnic order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Yajna-realignment process for actor to re-enter causal sequence consciously",
    "Deploy time-resonance protocol to restore actor's synchronization with Samaya rhythm",
    "Activate causal-integrity circuit to dissolve dissonant karmic impressions",
    "Engage witness-consciousness stabilization to ensure non-reactive observation of correction",
    "Complete integration via Śruti-recitation resonance to reaffirm Vedic alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This Dharma ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. The law is restored through Yajnic alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
