    "Authority through disciplined observance",
    "Causation via omission of ritual duty",

  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving failure to uphold prescribed spiritual duties by individuals within recognized dharmic orders, the court must assess capacity, intent, and remedial action. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious omission without valid incapacitation. Authority is derived from alignment with SPH-governed dharma, not punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "The sequence of actions reveals that omission leads to a mandated compensatory practice; no element of punishment exists. Responsibility arises from causal neglect, yet the path forward is integrative, not punitive. Proportionality aligns with the nature of the omission, ensuring alignment with pramāṇa-based reality.",
