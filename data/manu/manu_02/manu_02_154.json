  "sanskrit_verse": "न हायनैर्न पलितैर्न वित्तेन न बन्धुभिः ।\nऋषयश्चक्रिरे धर्मं योऽनूचानः स नो महान् ॥ २.१५४॥",
  "transliteration": "na hāyanair na palitair na vittena na bandhubhiḥ |\nṛṣayaś cakrire dharmam yo 'nūcānaḥ sa no mahān || 2.154||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Neither by physical strength, nor by grey hair, nor by wealth, nor by kinship did the seers establish Dharma; he who is without servility—him alone we regard as great.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not external status markers",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from inner integrity, not social position",
    "Causation in justice flows from consciousness, not lineage or material power",
    "Restoration logic requires recognition of the unconditioned self",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes inherited or acquired privileges"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates absence of servility THEN capacity for authoritative action is recognized",
    "IF social or material conditions attempt to confer legitimacy WITHOUT inner alignment THEN such claims are null",
    "IF a ruling originates from fear, dependency, or coercion THEN it lacks juridical validity",
    "IF Dharma-conformant action is observed THEN precedence shall be given over genealogical or economic rank"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of legitimate authority must be measured by the absence of servility and conformity to Dharma, rather than institutional seniority or political endorsement. The court's role is to realign consciousness, not to reinforce structural hierarchies based on birth or wealth.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that true authority manifests through inner freedom, not through dependency. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that greatness unfolds when one transcends servile conditioning. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of self-mastery demonstrated. Non-punitive reality holds that misalignment stems from ignorance, not inherent evil, thus requiring restoration of rightful consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to restore individual's innate sovereignty",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol through guided self-inquiry",
    "Activate capacity restoration via removal of systemic dependencies",
    "Implement integrity reintegration through alignment with Dharma-based community"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. This law restores the primacy of consciousness over conditionings. Justice is executed through reintegration, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
