  "sanskrit_verse": "श्रोत्रं त्वक्चक्षुषी जिह्वा नासिका चैव पञ्चमी ।\nपायूपस्थं हस्तपादं वाक्चैव दशमी स्मृता ॥ २.९०॥",
  "transliteration": "śrotraṃ tvak-cakṣuṣī jihvā nāsikā caiva pañcamī |\npāyūpasthaṃ hastapādaṃ vākcaiva daśamī smṛtā || 2.90||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The ten organs of action and knowledge—ears, skin, eyes, tongue, nose, excretory organ, reproductive organ, hands, feet, and speech—are designated as the tenth in completion of the human instrumentality for dharma-vyavahāra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the completeness of embodied capacity",
    "Causation arises through proper use of sensory-motor instruments",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is defined by access to and control over these ten faculties",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment of misuse through conscious re-engagement",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when all ten instruments function in harmony with dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF any individual exercises a faculty without dharmic alignment THEN initiate consciousness-restoration protocol",
    "IF misuse of any of the ten faculties disrupts social order THEN assign completion-process based on causal instrument",
    "IF capacity to engage ten faculties is impaired THEN deploy integrity-reintegration mechanism",
    "IF speech or bodily action violates dharma THEN invoke sequential-responsibility assumption procedure",
    "IF sensory perception leads to misaligned cognition THEN activate pramāṇa-based correction sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in determining which of the ten instruments was misused and whether such usage stemmed from ignorance or willful violation. Authority flows from recognition of the full instrumental capacity; thus, judgments must align the individual's consciousness back into harmonious engagement with their total embodied potential.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that every act originates from one or more of the ten instruments. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential unfolding of misuse rooted in distorted perception. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of correct usage. The non-punitive reality rule mandates restoration of right functioning rather than imposition of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sensory-perception recalibration program",
    "Assign verbal-expression purification process",
    "Engage limb-based karma-yoga integration practice",
    "Undertake breath-and-speech alignment sadhana",
    "Execute full-body consciousness reintegration cycle"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of this Dharma. Misuse of the ten instruments is dissolved through conscious restoration. Justice serves only reintegration, never punishment. Reality responds to alignment, not fear. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
