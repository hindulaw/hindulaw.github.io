    "Authority derived from Varna-dharma as ordained by SPH",

Responsibility thresholds are determined by initiation status and functional role within societal dharma, not individual intent. Restoration occurs through realignment with sequential dharma execution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that temporal and ritual order reflects cosmic alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential harmony among roles. Violation disrupts collective consciousness integrity. Responsibility is proportional to initiation level and awareness capacity. Correction restores sequential manifestation without punitive consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through correct sequencing of alms-round by Varna. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates true alignment."
