  "sanskrit_verse": "य आवृणोत्यवितथं ब्रह्मणा श्रवणावुभौ ।\nस माता स पिता ज्ञेयस्तं न द्रुह्येत्कदा चन ॥ २.१४४॥",
  "transliteration": "ya āvṛṇotyavitathaṃ brahmaṇā śravaṇāvubhau |\nsa mātā sa pitā jñeyas taṃ na druhyet kadā cana || 2.144||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who authentically reveals the Vedic Truth through both hearing and realization is to be known as mother and father; one must never act treacherously toward such a being at any time.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from direct experiential transmission of Vedic Truth",
    "Causation is established by integrity of knowledge conveyance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from recognition of authentic spiritual parentage",
    "Restoration logic requires alignment with the source-consciousness of revealed truth",
    "Consciousness alignment is secured through honoring those who embody and transmit Vedic realization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent recognizes a being as authentic conveyor of Vedic Truth THEN agent must not engage in treachery toward that being",
    "IF breach occurs THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol through acknowledgment of violated sacred authority",
    "IF knowledge-transmission relationship is verified THEN assign protection status to conveyor-being under DharmaNet protocols",
    "IF violation involves betrayal of spiritual parent THEN enforce completion process until original reverence is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, any case involving betrayal or defamation of a recognized spiritual guide or Vedic conveyor must be evaluated based on the ontological precedence of consciousness continuity over personal interest. The threshold for responsibility is determined by the accused's conscious acceptance of the conveyor's authenticity, not external evidence alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that treachery against a Vedic conveyor disrupts the sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of Dharma within societal consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of prior recognition of the conveyor’s truth-bearing capacity. Non-punitive enforcement restores the disrupted causal chain through reconnection and reverence completion rather than punitive deterrence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate reverential acknowledgment cycle wherein violator publicly affirms the conveyor's spiritual parentage",
    "Assign guided reflection period under qualified mentorship to restore awareness of violated sacred bond",
    "Implement dharmic service obligation aligned with conveyor’s mission until energetic harmony is reinstated",
    "Enforce silence period regarding the conveyor to prevent further disruption of their consciousness field"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
