  "sanskrit_verse": "धर्मार्थावुच्यते श्रेयः कामार्थौ धर्म एव च ।\nअर्थ एवैह वा श्रेयस्त्रिवर्ग इति तु स्थितिः ॥ २.२२४॥",
  "transliteration": "dharmārthāvucyate śreyaḥ kāmārthau dharma eva ca |\nartha eva eha vā śreyas trivarga iti tu sthitiḥ || 2.224||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Dharma and Artha together constitute the highest good; Kama and Artha also align with Dharma. Alternatively, Artha alone may be considered the highest good—such is the established position of the threefold aim of life.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma as defined by SPH",
    "Causation arises through conscious intention aligned with Trivarga",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to uphold Dharma in pursuit of Artha and Kama",
    "Restoration logic operates through reintegration into Trivarga harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures sustainable societal equilibrium"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action aligns with Dharma THEN action supports Trivarga realization",
    "IF individual pursues Artha without violating Dharma THEN state must facilitate capacity-building",
    "IF Kama is pursued within Dharmic framework THEN no judicial intervention required",
    "IF misalignment occurs THEN initiate restorative protocol for consciousness realignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all legal decisions must evaluate whether actions support or disrupt the Trivarga framework. The threshold of responsibility lies in determining alignment with Dharma first, followed by assessing impact on Artha and Kama. Authority resides solely in those who embody Dharma as declared by SPH.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal sequence follows intentional alignment with Trivarga. Misalignment manifests due to lack of Dharmic understanding, not inherent fault. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and capacity. Therefore, correction occurs through guidance toward Dharmic integration rather than punitive measures.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Dharmic education program tailored to individual consciousness level",
    "Assign mentorship under qualified Dharmic authority",
    "Establish completion process for unresolved intentions related to Artha/Kama",
    "Reintegrate individual into community through service aligned with Trivarga"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds exclusively from the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma has been restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
