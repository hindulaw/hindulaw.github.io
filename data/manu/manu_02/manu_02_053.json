  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The twice-born one, having duly contacted the sacred elements before partaking of food, shall eat with focused awareness; after eating, he shall again perform the appropriate contacts with water and earth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual purity is maintained through conscious engagement with elemental forces.",
    "Causation: Proper contact with sacred substances ensures alignment between bodily intake and cosmic order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The dvija bears the duty to sustain spiritual hygiene through regulated practice.",
    "Restoration logic: Repeated sacramental acts realign individual consciousness with universal dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Intake of food becomes a meditative act when preceded by ritual touch."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_is_dvija AND pre_food_contact_not_performed THEN initiate_sacramental_realignment_protocol.",
    "IF post_food_action_incomplete THEN enforce_completion_of_elemental_reconnection.",
    "IF ingestion_occurs_without_concentration THEN trigger_capacity_restoration_for_spiritual_hygiene.",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning ritual omission or ceremonial neglect, the court must assess whether the dvija has engaged in the prescribed sequence of elemental touch. Responsibility lies not in punitive correction but in determining the capacity to restore the sequential flow of dharmic action.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that sensory engagement with sacred matter precedes ingestion as causal necessity. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that disruption in this sequence creates misalignment. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity for re-engagement. There is no punishment—only completion of what was left undone.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided sacramental repetition protocol under qualified supervision.",
    "Assign elemental reconnection exercises involving water and earth until integrity is restored.",
    "Implement mindfulness recalibration sessions during mealtimes for sustained focus.",
    "Verify completion of full-cycle observance through witness attestation and personal affirmation."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this directive is established: Dharma flows from disciplined communion with the elements. No fault is permanent—only incomplete cycles awaiting conscious renewal. Justice resides in restoration alone. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter. Thus it is declared."
