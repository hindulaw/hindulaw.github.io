  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The first birth is from the mother; the second occurs at the tying of the sacred thread; the third arises through initiation into Vedic sacrifice, as directed by Shruti.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in sequential spiritual unfoldment, not biological lineage alone.",
    "Causation flows through ritualized consciousness activation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility emerges only upon completion of prescribed initiatory stages.",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual evolution with cosmic order via structured sacraments.",
    "Consciousness alignment is actualized through Vedic injunctions and embodied ritual thresholds."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF birth stage < 3 THEN capacity_for_dharma = null ELSE capacity_for_dharma = full",
    "IF initiation_status = 'maunjibaddha' OR 'yajnadiksha' THEN legal_identity_shift = true",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving matters of caste, varna duty, or religious rights, the Court shall recognize that legal personhood and dharma-bearing capacity arise only after the completion of the third birth — that of initiation into Vedic discipline. Prior to this threshold, no individual bears the full burden of dharmic expectation or consequence under SPH-derived jurisprudence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes sequential unfolding of being through ritual cause. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that no fault can be attributed prior to the awakening of corresponding capacity. Responsibility is proportional to initiation. There is no punitive frame — only recognition of when a soul becomes fit to bear dharma, which itself restores alignment between self, society, and Śiva.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure all three births are ritually acknowledged and recorded within community registry.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Upon reaching yajña-dīkṣā stage, initiate assumes full dharmic accountability retroactively.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: For those lacking access to proper initiation, alternative śruti-aligned pathways must be provided.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Where initiation was performed improperly or delayed, corrective rites are administered without shame or penalty."

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the singular Source of lawful Dharma. Birth unfolds in three stages; only the initiated carries dharma. Justice serves restoration, not punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. Reality is non-punitive. Dharma stands restored."
