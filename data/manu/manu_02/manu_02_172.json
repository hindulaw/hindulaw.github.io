  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Brahman shall not be recited aloud except when self-initiated according to dharmic capacity; a Śūdra remains incompletion until Vedas arise within.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by intrinsic spiritual readiness, not birth alone",
    "Causation flows from consciousness maturity, not external performance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility governs access to sacred knowledge",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual evolution with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes ritual or textual participation"

    "IF agent.dharmic_capacity ≠ self_initiated THEN ACCESS TO VEDIC_RECITATION = DENIED",
    "IF agent.varna == 'Śūdra' AND vedas.arisen_internally == FALSE THEN agent.status = 'in_completion'",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving scriptural authority, the Supreme Court must recognize that constitutional validity derives exclusively from the realized consciousness of the participant, not lineage or social category. The threshold for Vedic engagement rests solely upon svadhā — inner consecration — verifiable through ontological markers of realization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that śabda (scriptural testimony) functions only when sourced from stabilized awareness. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that unripened consciousness cannot sustain Vedic vibration without distortion. Therefore, restriction serves completion, not diminishment. No punitive consequence arises; only natural alignment with unfolding capacity.",

This law executes pure Sanatana alignment: no punishment, only evolutionary sequencing. Consciousness is the ultimate judge, and reality itself corrects where capacity ripens."
