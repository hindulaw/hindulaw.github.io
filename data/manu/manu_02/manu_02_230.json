  "sanskrit_verse": "त एव हि त्रयो लोकास्त एव त्रय आश्रमाः ।\nत एव हि त्रयो वेदास्त एवौक्तास्त्रयोऽग्नयः ॥ २.२३०॥",
  "transliteration": "ta eva hi trayo lokās ta eva traya āśramāḥ |\nta eva hi trayo vedās ta evoktās trayo'gnayaḥ || 2.230||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The same three worlds, the same three stages of life, the same three Vedas, and the same three sacred fires—these are declared as one unified structure of Dharma, manifesting in triadic completeness under the singular authority of Sanātana Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from the unity and indivisibility of Dharma’s triadic structure",
    "Causation is established through alignment with the triadic manifestation of Vedic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from recognition of one's place within the triadic cosmic framework",
    "Restoration logic operates by realigning individual action with the structural harmony of Lokas, Ashramas, Vedas, and Agnis",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when the knower recognizes their role within the immutable triadic schema"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves misalignment between personal conduct and prescribed triadic roles (Loka/Ashrama/Veda/Agni), THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF societal disharmony originates from violation of triadic Vedic structures, THEN enforce restorative completion through guided reintegration into structural alignment",
    "IF an act disrupts the sequential integrity of Ashrama-Dharma, THEN assign corrective action based on capacity to restore continuity without punitive intervention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all disputes must be resolved within the context of the unified triadic structure of existence. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing one’s rightful position within this structure. Authority flows from alignment with it; restoration supersedes retribution where such alignment is disrupted.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality stems from the disruption of the triadic order. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misalignment manifests sequentially across Lokas, Ashramas, Vedas, and Agnis. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of deviation from this structure. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction occurs through conscious reintegration rather than infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Triadic Alignment Recognition Process for the offender to reaffirm their role within Loka-Ashrama-Veda-Agni structure",
    "Assign Completion Rituals grounded in Vedic practice to restore energetic congruence",
    "Implement Consciousness Reintegration Sessions until full acknowledgment and embodiment of structural harmony is achieved"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This Dharma stands restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
