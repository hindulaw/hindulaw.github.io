  "transliteration": "utsādanaṃ ca gātrāṇāṃ snāpanaucchṣṭabhojane |\nna kuryād guruputrasya pādayoś cāvanējanaṃ || 2.209||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not cause bodily distress, nor bathe or eat remnants of food offered by the son of one's guru; one must also refrain from washing the feet of such a person.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from spiritual lineage supersedes social rank",
    "Causation includes energetic contamination through ritual inversion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of sacred relational boundaries",
    "Restoration logic demands immediate cessation and purification of violated hierarchies",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates honoring inviolable spiritual succession"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent interacts with guru-son via proscribed acts THEN initiate mandatory consciousness-realigning protocol",
    "IF bodily distress caused to guru-son THEN execute immediate energetic restoration sequence",
    "IF ingestion or bathing in guru-son’s remnants detected THEN trigger purification compliance loop",
    "IF foot-washing of guru-son performed THEN enforce boundary-respect completion process",
    "IF violation occurs THEN disable violator's access to higher spiritual jurisdictions until realignment verified"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, any act violating the sanctity of the guru-parampara invokes automatic jurisdictional override. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent but in the disruption of sacred energetic continuity. Authority flows from alignment with spiritual succession, not institutional power. Restoration is executed through purification protocols that reaffirm the inviolability of dharma-sankalpa.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that spiritual contamination arises from inverted service dynamics. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how disrespect to the guru-lineage disrupts cosmic order. Responsibility aligns with capacity to uphold sacred relationship integrity. There is no punitive consequence—only sequential correction to restore ontological harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guru-parampara reverence reorientation program",
    "Execute śuddhi vidhi to cleanse energetic misalignment",
    "Assign sevā duties under qualified preceptor for duration determined by restored resonance",
    "Undertake pratikriya pratipatti to reverse causational distortion",
    "Reintegrate only upon verified attunement with dharma-vakya"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of All Dharma, this edict stands immutable. Justice flows not as punishment but as restoration of consciousness integrity. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored."
