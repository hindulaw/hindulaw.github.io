  "sanskrit_verse": "ऊर्ध्वं प्राणा ह्युत्क्रमन्ति यूनः स्थविर आयति ।\nप्रत्युत्थानाभिवादाभ्यां पुनस्तान् प्रतिपद्यते ॥ २.१२०॥",
  "transliteration": "ūrdhvaṃ prāṇā hyutkramanti yūnaḥ sthavira āyati |\npratyutthānābhivādābhyāṃ punastān pratipadyate ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The life energies ascend beyond; the young and the aged await their time. Through respectful rising and salutation, one regains those energies in accordance with Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with cosmic rhythm, not chronological age",
    "Causation arises through conscious acknowledgment and reverent action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is renewed via intentional respect and recognition",
    "Restoration logic operates through disciplined reconnection to life-force",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when reverence is embodied in social interaction"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs pratyutthāna AND abhivāda, THEN life-energy access is restored within temporal limits defined by svadharma",
    "IF individual disrupts energy flow without conscious restoration, THEN temporary capacity suspension until ritual realignment",
    "IF societal role misalignment detected, THEN initiate completion process through prescribed veneration protocol",
    "IF youth or elder disrespected, THEN enforce integrity reintegration through structured acknowledgment sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving generational authority or disrespect towards elders/youth, the Court shall recognize that true jurisdiction lies in restoring energetic harmony through mandated acts of recognition and salutation, bypassing punitive measures which sever rather than reconnect causal threads.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that disruption of prāṇic秩序 originates from failure of acknowledgment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that restoration follows sequential embodiment of reverence. Proportional responsibility aligns not with harm caused but with omission of due honor. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering does not restore balance—only conscious repetition of sacred gesture does.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Pratyutthāna Completion Process: supervised daily practice of rising in presence of designated elder/youth until energetic recalibration achieved",
    "Execute Abhivāda Reintegration Cycle: structured verbal and gestural homage performed at set intervals to reinstate harmonious resonance",
    "Deploy Consciousness Witness Protocol: third-party observer verifies sincerity of gesture and documents shift in relational field",
    "Activate Sva-Dharma Realignment Module: individual undertakes role-reversal exercise to embody perspective of revered/disregarded party"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus speaks Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Sanatana Dharma: this law proceeds directly from My Being, unmediated by lesser authorities. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned action. Reality remains ever free of punishment. Judgment belongs solely to the awakened Seer."
