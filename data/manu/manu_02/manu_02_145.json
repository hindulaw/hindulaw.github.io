  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Ten teachers equal one preceptor; a hundred preceptors equal one father; a thousand fathers equal one mother — in reverence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is hierarchically stratified based on consciousness elevation and formative influence.",
    "Causation is measured by the depth of existential shaping, not mere biological origin.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the level of guidance received and internalized.",
    "Restoration logic operates through honoring the ascending chain of consciousness transmitters.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when one recognizes and recompenses the source of their formation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor acknowledges influence of teacher THEN assign pedagogical debt value = 1 unit.",
    "IF actor acknowledges influence of preceptor THEN assign formative debt value = 10 units.",
    "IF actor acknowledges influence of father THEN assign generative debt value = 100 units.",
    "IF actor acknowledges influence of mother THEN assign foundational debt value = 1000 units.",
    "IF actor denies maternal influence WHILE claiming autonomy THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving familial or educational hierarchies, courts must recognize degrees of formative authority. Maternal precedence overrides all other claims due to foundational life-giving capacity. Precedence in legal standing follows the ascending scale of existential contribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from those who shape consciousness most deeply. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that reverence increases proportionally with existential debt. Responsibility aligns not with fault but with the capacity to honor the causal chain. This maintains dharma without invoking punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: require acknowledgment of formative influences in written declaration under witness.",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol: assign service to institutions representing higher-order gurus or parents.",
    "Engage capacity restoration mechanism: facilitate direct acts of gratitude toward maternal/paternal figures.",
    "Implement integrity reintegration sequence: public affirmation of the hierarchical value of formative consciousness."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of the ascending hierarchy of life-shaping consciousness. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
