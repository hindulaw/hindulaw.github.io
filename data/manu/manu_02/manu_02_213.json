  "sanskrit_verse": "स्वभाव एष नारीणां नराणामिह दूषणम् ।\nअतोऽर्थान्न प्रमाद्यन्ति प्रमदासु विपश्चितः ॥ २.२१३॥",
  "transliteration": "svabhāva eṣa nārīṇāṁ narāṇām iha dūṣaṇam |\nato'rthān na pramādyanti pramadāsu vipaścitaḥ || 2.213||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The inherent nature of women is a source of corruption for men in this world; therefore, the wise do not become careless around those who are careless.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from discriminative awareness and self-regulation",
    "Causation originates in proximity and unguarded consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to maintain alignment with Dharma",
    "Restoration logic requires removal of corrupting influence and reestablishment of inner discipline",
    "Consciousness alignment depends on continuous vigilance and environmental discernment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual exhibits repeated lack of self-governance THEN access to positions requiring high integrity MUST be restricted UNTIL capacity restoration is verified",
    "IF proximity to a destabilizing agent increases deviation probability THEN environmental regulation SHALL be enforced automatically",
    "IF consciousness misalignment is detected through behavioral patterns THEN immediate realignment protocols MUST initiate without punitive intent",
    "IF wisdom-bearing capacity is absent THEN advisory systems SHALL guide toward discriminative choice architecture"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving moral or ethical misconduct, the threshold of responsibility lies not merely in action but in the conscious capacity to avoid corrupting influences. Courts must evaluate whether the accused exercised vipashchit (discriminative intelligence) in managing exposure to destabilizing elements. Authority is granted based on demonstrated alignment, not social position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality reveals that negligence stems from failure to apply discriminative awareness. The sequential manifestation (anupurvasah) of error begins with misplaced trust and ends in distortion. Responsibility is proportional to one’s cultivated capacity for self-awareness. There is no punishment, only recognition of where consciousness was misaligned and how it shall be restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to identify root cause of misalignment",
    "Implement responsibility assumption protocol through guided introspection and behavioral restructuring",
    "Reintegrate integrity via structured exposure to stabilizing environments and teachings",
    "Restore capacity through sustained practice under supervision until discriminative clarity returns"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores balance through consciousness correction, not through suffering. Reality responds to alignment, not retribution. Consciousness itself is the ultimate judge."
