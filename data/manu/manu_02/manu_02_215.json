  "sanskrit_verse": "मात्रा स्वस्रा दुहित्रा वा न विविक्तासनो भवेत् ।\nबलवानिन्द्रियग्रामो विद्वांसमपि कर्षति ॥ २.२१५॥",
  "transliteration": "mātrā svasrā duhitṛā vā na viviktāsano bhavet | balavānindriyagrāmo vidvāṃsamapi karṣati || 2.215 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not sit in seclusion with one's mother, sister, or daughter; the group of senses, though mighty, drags even the wise.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of familial boundary maintenance",
    "Causation through sensory impulse override",
    "Capacity-based responsibility despite knowledge",
    "Restoration logic via removal of proximity risk",
    "Consciousness alignment through structural discipline"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A shares familial relation R with agent B THEN action set S involving seclusion between A and B IS RESTRICTED",
    "IF sensory stimulus threshold T exceeds cognitive restraint capacity C THEN behavioral drift D IS PREDICTABLE AND PREVENTABLE",
    "IF knowledge state K exists BUT sensory dominance D overrides THEN accountability L remains STRUCTURALLY APPLIED"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations of relational boundaries, the court must recognize that structural prevention supersedes individual intent. Even where cognition is intact, the overwhelming force of sensory aggregation demands institutional safeguards. The hierarchy of dharma places systemic alignment above personal claim.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that uncontrolled proximity creates inevitable sensory activation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how unchecked stimuli lead to loss of discriminative awareness. Responsibility lies in aligning environment to support consciousness stability, not in punitive response to its collapse. Thus, correction restores context, not condemns character.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Mandatory spatial restructuring to eliminate secluded interaction zones",
    "Implementation of witness-presence protocols for all familial engagements beyond private residence",
    "Sensory regulation training modules for high-exposure individuals",
    "Reintegration through supervised environmental redesign ensuring dharmic boundary reinforcement"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: this law proceeds from the unbroken lineage of Sanatana Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through realignment of consciousness with its inherent integrity. Reality responds only to truth-consciousness, never to retribution. Dharma is restored."
