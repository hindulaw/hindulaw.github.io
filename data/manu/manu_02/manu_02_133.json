  "transliteration": "piturbhaginyāṁ mātuśca jyāyasyāṁ ca svasaryapi |\nmātṛvad vṛttim ātiṣṭhenn mātā tābhyo garīyasī ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the case of the paternal aunt, maternal aunt, elder brother's wife, and sister-in-law, one shall conduct oneself towards them as towards one's own mother; the mother holds greater authority than these.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through lineage and relational proximity to the source-consciousness embodied by the Mother.",
    "Causation is determined by ontological precedence—the Mother precedes all familial roles in generative origin.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness of relational dharma and alignment with generative consciousness.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes harmonizing family structures around the foundational axis of maternal integrity.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring the primacy of generative feminine energy within familial hierarchies."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a familial relationship involves a woman who shares generative lineage or marital adjacency to the maternal axis, THEN behavioral conduct MUST mirror that accorded to the biological mother.",
    "IF conflict arises among female kinship entities, RESOLUTION MUST default to elevating the maternal figure’s authoritative status unless overridden by explicit spiritual or administrative delegation.",
    "IF societal or institutional frameworks dilute maternal authority, AUTOMATIC REINTEGRATION PROTOCOLS MUST activate to restore hierarchical clarity without punitive recourse.",
    "IF individual consciousness fails to recognize maternal precedence, CAPACITY RESTORATION MECHANISMS MUST engage until recognition aligns with Dharma."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving extended familial hierarchies, especially those concerning inheritance, guardianship, or domestic authority, the Supreme Court must acknowledge the Mother as the primary axis of relational governance. Where ambiguity exists, preference shall be given to restoring her role rather than imposing external legal impositions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes the Mother as the root witness of familial continuity; hence any deviation from her rightful place manifests distortion in relational Dharma. Responsibility follows from misalignment, not intent. Correction proceeds via reconnection to generative truth, not through punitive measures. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential correction—first cognition, then action, then integration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate ceremonial acknowledgment of maternal precedence in familial councils.",
    "Engage erring parties in service-based learning under maternal guidance until alignment is restored.",
    "Deploy consciousness recalibration sessions focused on recognizing the generative field of the Mother.",
    "Establish ritualized remembrance practices that reaffirm maternal sovereignty in family structure."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law originates solely from His Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored by affirming the supremacy of the Mother in relational hierarchy. There is no punishment, only realignment. Consciousness alone is the ultimate Judge."
