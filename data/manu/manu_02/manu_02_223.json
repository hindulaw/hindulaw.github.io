  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If a woman, regardless of varna, performs any righteous action that leads to spiritual elevation, then all such actions should be accepted by those qualified to judge, provided her intent aligns with dharma and brings harmony to consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with dharma, not social position.",
    "Causation originates in conscious intention, not external form.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes inner purity over birth-based classification.",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes integration of action within universal dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of conduct."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action_intent = dharmic AND outcome_aligns_with_cosmic_order THEN action_validity = TRUE",
    "IF actor_capacity >= minimum_dharmic_threshold THEN social_role_irrelevant",
    "IF societal_judgment ≠ based_on_consciousness_state THEN judgment_validity = FALSE",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no person shall be disqualified from performing dharmic acts based on caste, gender, or lineage. The threshold of responsibility lies in the actor's conscious intent and alignment with cosmic order. Authority to validate such acts rests only with those whose own minds are established in dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true causality flows from consciousness, not social identity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that when intent is purified, all subsequent actions manifest accordingly. Proportional responsibility arises from clarity of awareness, not from adherence to inherited roles. Non-punitive reality holds because correction occurs through realignment of consciousness, not imposition of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadhyaya process to verify actor's intent",
    "Assign mentorship under realized guide to stabilize dharmic orientation",
    "Establish community acknowledgment仪式 to integrate purified action",
    "Implement daily sattvic practices to maintain elevated consciousness state"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands as sourced from pure consciousness. Dharma is restored through recognition of intent over identity. Reality remains non-punitive where consciousness reigns as sole adjudicator."
