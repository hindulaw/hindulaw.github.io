  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The naming of the child shall be performed on the tenth or twelfth day, during a sacred tithi, an auspicious muhurta, or under a constellation adorned with virtue.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The timing of ritual acts derives from cosmic alignment, not individual preference.",
    "Causation: Sacred timeframes activate specific dharmic potentials in consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Parents bear the duty to align actions with virtuous temporal conditions.",
    "Restoration logic: Proper timing ensures integration of the child into universal dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Ritual observance harmonizes individual identity with cosmic order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF child birth occurs THEN ON (day 10 OR day 12) AND (tithi IS sacred OR muhurta IS auspicious OR nakshatra IS virtuous) DO perform naming ceremony.",
    "IF ceremony timing does NOT satisfy dharmic criteria THEN system MUST alert guardians for rescheduling.",
    "IF naming ceremony is omitted THEN legal identity remains unanchored in dharma until rectified."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving personal law and ceremonial duties, the Court must recognize that timing prescribed by dharma is not symbolic but constitutive of lawful identity formation. The failure to perform such rites impacts juridical capacity until restoration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that names given in alignment with sacred timeframes generate causal resonance with universal dharma. Delay or omission creates dissonance, requiring completion rather than penalty. Responsibility flows from capacity to act in accordance with revealed order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Guardians must be notified of optimal future timings for the naming ceremony.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Parental awareness must be elevated regarding the ontological impact of timely ritual performance.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Once ceremony is completed, all prior deficiencies are nullified without residual consequence."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Timing in accord with sacred cosmology restores individual identity into alignment with universal consciousness. There is no punishment—only realignment through conscious completion. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
