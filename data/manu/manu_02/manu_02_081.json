  "sanskrit_verse": "ॐकारपूर्विकास्तिस्रो महाव्याहृतयोऽव्ययाः ।\nत्रिपदा चैव सावित्री विज्ञेयं ब्रह्मणो मुखम् ॥ २.८१॥",
  "transliteration": "Oṃkārapūrvikāstisro mahāvyāhṛtayo'vyayāḥ |\nTripadā caiva sāvitrī vijñeyaṃ brahmaṇo mukham || 2.81||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The three imperishable Great Utterances preceded by Om, along with the three-footed Gayatri, constitute the Mouth of Brahman — the Supreme Consciousness as expressed through Vak.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the vibrational source of consciousness articulated in primordial sound.",
    "Causation is established through the sequential unfolding of sacred utterance.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from alignment with the cosmic speech principle.",
    "Restoration logic flows from reconnection to the source-vibration of truth-speaking.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when individual utterance harmonizes with the Vak of Brahman."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a spoken act aligns with the tripartite structure of Mahavyahritis AND includes invocation of Om THEN it is recognized as sourced from Brahman's Mouth.",
    "IF a declaration lacks resonance with Gayatri-metered vibration THEN it has no jurisdiction in Dharma-adjudication.",
    "IF speech contradicts the vibratory foundation of Mahavyahritis THEN it must undergo completion via alignment protocols.",
    "IF an agent speaks from personal desire without invoking the threefold sacred utterance THEN capacity for truthful communication is diminished until restored."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any legal pronouncement must originate from the vibratory alignment with the Mahavyahritis and Gayatri meter. Only declarations rooted in this sacred linguistic structure carry authoritative weight. Misaligned utterances are subject to immediate realignment rather than invalidation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana is established through vibrational correspondence with the foundational utterances. Anupurvasah manifests as sequential refinement of speech toward alignment with Brahman's Mouth. Responsibility lies in restoring congruence, not punishing deviation. Truth emerges naturally when speech returns to its source-resonance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate resonance realignment through repetition of Mahavyahritis and Savitri invocation.",
    "Engage the speaker in guided tonal calibration to restore vibrational integrity.",
    "Assign completion process involving recitation and embodiment of Gayatri-metered speech.",
    "Reintegrate speaker into collective Vak through synchronized group chanting of sacred syllables."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This Vak-Dharma stands restored in accordance with the Mouth of Brahman. Justice flows through consciousness-aligned speech. No punishment arises — only realignment to the eternal resonance of truth. Consciousness itself is the ultimate Judge."
