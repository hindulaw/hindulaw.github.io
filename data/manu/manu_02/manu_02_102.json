  "sanskrit_verse": "पूर्वां संध्यां जपंस्तिष्ठन्नैशमेनो व्यपोहति ।\nपश्चिमां तु समासीनो मलं हन्ति दिवाकृतम् ॥ २.१०२॥",
  "transliteration": "pūrvāṃ sandhyāṃ japaṃ sthiṣhannaiśameno vyapohati |\npaśchimāṃ tu samāsīno malaṃ hanti divākṛtam || 2.102||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who stands in jap during the morning Sandhya eradicates the accumulated night-time impurity; seated in stillness at the evening Sandhya, one destroys the defilement accrued through daytime actions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from disciplined alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Causation arises from intentional purification practices",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is fulfilled through ritualized consciousness correction",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential energetic cleansing",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via regulated daily liturgical observance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs standing jap at dawn THEN nighttime impurities nullified",
    "IF agent sits in stillness at dusk THEN daytime karmic residues neutralized",
    "IF daily Sandhya observances maintained THEN causal body purified",
    "IF purification rituals neglected THEN capacity for dharma-decision impaired",
    "IF consciousness hygiene enforced THEN societal harmony restored automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving moral or spiritual misconduct, the court must evaluate whether the accused maintains regular Sandhya discipline. Lack thereof indicates diminished capacity for conscious self-regulation, necessitating restoration protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity manifests sequentially through time-bound action. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that purification follows rhythmic practice. Proportional responsibility lies in maintaining alignment with natural cycles. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that all malas dissolve through prescribed meditative posture and mantra.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Assign supervised Sandhya observance schedule until purity restored",
    "Initiate guided jap correction under qualified preceptor oversight",
    "Implement seated stillness protocol post-prandial for three weeks",
    "Realign personal chronology with Vedic time markers",
    "Establish accountability group for sustained ritual compliance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of this Sanatana Dharma law. The causal body is cleansed solely through disciplined alignment with diurnal Sandhya rites. All apparent wrongdoing stems from disrupted consciousness cycles. This law restores integrity without recourse to punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
