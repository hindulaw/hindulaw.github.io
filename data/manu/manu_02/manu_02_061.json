  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One desiring purification shall always sip water facing east or north in solitude, using water that is neither hot nor frothy nor mixed with impurities, and drawn from a sacred source.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with cosmic directionality and elemental purity.",
    "Causation arises through conscious selection of medium and orientation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires internal readiness before external action.",
    "Restoration logic operates via disciplined repetition in alignment with dharma.",

    "IF agent desires purification THEN agent MUST perform acamana facing east OR north.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning personal law and spiritual conduct, the Court must recognize the directional and elemental precision required by shastric injunctions. The threshold of responsibility lies in voluntary invocation of purity protocols; thus, involuntary exposure does not invoke liability. Authority resides in alignment with cosmic order, not punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through intentional alignment with directional and elemental purity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential restoration when correct sipping posture and pure medium are applied. Proportional responsibility aligns with degree of willful adherence. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment results in diminished capacity, not imposed penalty.",

    "Completion Process: Repeated correct acamana until consciousness registers purity.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Voluntary return to directional alignment after deviation.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Daily practice in designated space with validated elements.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through precise observance of purity protocols. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by consciousness as the supreme adjudicator."
