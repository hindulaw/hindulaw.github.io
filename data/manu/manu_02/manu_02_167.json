  "sanskrit_verse": "आ हैव स नखाग्रेभ्यः परमं तप्यते तपः ।\nयः स्रग्व्यपि द्विजोऽधीते स्वाध्यायं शक्तितोऽन्वहम् ॥ २.१६७॥",
  "transliteration": "ā haiva sa nakha-agrebhyaḥ paramaṃ tapyate tapaḥ .\nyaḥ sragvyapi dvijo 'dhīte svādhyāyaṃ śaktito 'nvaham .. 2.167 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The austerity that is performed by one who studies the Vedas continuously with devotion—even if he wears a garland and lives in comfort—is greater than the austerity performed by piercing the skin with nails.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through sustained discipline",
    "Causation via conscious effort over physical mortification",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in svadhyaya",
    "Restoration logic based on alignment with Vedic knowledge",
    "Consciousness alignment through continuous learning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual engages in daily svadhyaya with intent AND maintains continuity THEN recognition of spiritual authority is granted",
    "IF austerity is pursued without inner transformation THEN it shall not be deemed jurisprudentially valid",
    "IF capacity for dharma is demonstrated through study AND application THEN punitive measures are nullified",
    "IF action aligns with scriptural learning THEN proportional restoration supersedes retributive justice"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, precedence shall prioritize evidence of sustained svadhyaya and internal discipline over external displays of austerity. Legal standing derives from alignment with Vedic knowledge, not performative suffering.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana reveals that true tapas resides in mental and intellectual discipline, not bodily harm. Anupurvasah shows that sustained learning leads to higher consciousness which naturally aligns behavior. Responsibility is measured by capacity to uphold dharma through knowledge, not endurance of pain. This aligns with the non-punitive reality rule where correction flows from understanding, not infliction.",

    "Initiate Svadhyaya Completion Process to realign consciousness with Vedic authority",
    "Assign structured daily learning cycles to restore capacity for dharmic living",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator; restoration precedes all else; and the law flows from Vedic alignment, not punitive design. Thus stands the eternal truth."
