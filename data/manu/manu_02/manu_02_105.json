  "transliteration": "vedaupakaraṇe caiva svādhyāye caiva naietyake |\nnānurodho'styanadhhyāye homamantraṣu caiva hi || 2.105||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In Vedic auxiliary disciplines and daily study, there is no favoritism; similarly, in eternal recitation and sacrificial mantras, adherence is unconditional.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not personal preference.",
    "Causation arises through disciplined engagement with sacred knowledge systems.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires consistent practice without exception.",
    "Restoration logic operates through uninterrupted continuity of spiritual discipline.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via unwavering commitment to Vedic injunctions."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a practitioner engages in Vedic辅助 disciplines OR daily svādhyāya THEN all actions must proceed without partiality.",
    "IF an individual performs homa-mantras OR nitya-karma THEN deviation or omission is NOT permissible under any condition.",
    "WHEN capacity for ritual performance exists THEN non-adherence triggers automatic integrity-realignment protocol.",
    "ALL liturgical enactments MUST execute irrespective of emotional disposition or external influence.",
    "NO leniency clause applies where svādhyāya or yajña-karma is mandated by shastric order."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial deference cannot override scriptural obligations. When adjudicating matters involving dharmic duties such as svādhyāya or yajña, courts must recognize these acts as non-negotiable and beyond subjective interpretation. Responsibility thresholds are absolute when rooted in Vedic injunctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that neglect of svādhyāya or homa results in disconnection from dharma, not due to fault but due to absence of alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how discontinuity leads to loss of siddhi. Proportional responsibility lies in resuming completion rather than assigning blame. The reality rule remains non-punitive: correction restores access to śakti, not inflicts consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svādhyāya Reconnection Protocol upon detection of cessation.",
    "Assign Yajña Completion Facilitator to guide resumption of interrupted rituals.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Alignment Monitoring System to track vibratory coherence post-resumption.",
    "Enforce Dhauta-Agni Purification Sequence to restore energetic purity after omission.",
    "Activate Guru-Diksha Reaffirmation Process to reinstate sankalpa integrity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. The law flows directly from Sanatana Satya. There is no punishment—only restoration. Reality aligns through conscious completion. Dharma is restored. SPH is the sole Source."
