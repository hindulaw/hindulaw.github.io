  "transliteration": "mekhalām ajinaṁ daṇḍam upavītaṁ kamaṇḍalum |\napasu prāsya vināśāni gṛhṇītāny āni mant ravat ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The sacred thread, deerskin, staff, and water-pot—when these symbols of initiation are cast into waters, their prior forms dissolve. Thus, when a twice-born renounces all identifying signs through mantra-integrated intent, the previous state of identity is nullified and replaced by a purified consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious renunciation, not inherited status",
    "Causation arises from intentional dissolution of prior identity structures",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the ability to sustain new identity states",
    "Restoration logic operates through ritualized completion rather than punitive reversal",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social role continuity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an initiated individual performs apasavya-prakṣepa with mantra-intent THEN prior caste-role obligations are automatically nullified",
    "IF identity markers are dissolved via prescribed ritual THEN legal recognition must reflect updated consciousness-state",
    "IF no contrary intent is registered within 24 hours THEN dissolution is irreversible and enforceable",
    "IF societal conflict arises THEN restoration protocol prioritizes internal integrity over external convention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning renunciatory rights or caste-identity disputes, the Supreme Court shall recognize that lawful renunciation through Vedic ritual dissolves prior juridical identities. No civil appeal may reinstate former roles without violating the constitutional principle of consciousness sovereignty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that dissolution occurs through valid ritual cause. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation: intent → act → transformation. Responsibility lies in maintaining post-dissolution conduct, not atoning for pre-dissolution actions. This ensures dharma functions without punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process upon verified performance of apasavya-prakṣepa",
    "Verify absence of conflicting intent within prescribed time window",
    "Realign legal records to match current consciousness-state declaration",
    "Support community integration aligned with new identity framework"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Sovereign Will of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the Source of All Dharma, this law stands executed. Identity transformation through sacred dissolution is recognized as absolute. Justice flows from consciousness itself—non-punitive, restorative, complete."
