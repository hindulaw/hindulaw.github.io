  "sanskrit_verse": "एकाक्षरं परं ब्रह्म प्राणायामः परं तपः ।\nसावित्र्यास्तु परं नास्ति मौनात्सत्यं विशिष्यते ॥ २.८३॥",
  "transliteration": "ekākṣaraṁ paraṁ brahma prāṇāyāmaḥ paraṁ tapaḥ |\nsāvitrīyāstu paraṁ nāsti maunātsatyaṁ viśiṣyate || 2.83||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The single syllable 'Om' is the Supreme Brahman; breath regulation is the highest austerity. Of the Savitri (Gayatri), there is nothing higher than silence, and truth stands supreme.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in ontological sound—Om—as the foundational basis of all lawful manifestation.",
    "Causation aligns with disciplined consciousness—prāṇāyama—as a prerequisite for legal integrity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through silent awareness and truthful alignment.",
    "Restoration logic operates through the reconnection of individual will with cosmic order via disciplined practice.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved by integrating sacred utterance, regulated energy, and silent truth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an actor engages in systematic prāṇāyama THEN their capacity for truthful judgment increases proportionally.",
    "IF a dispute involves core constitutional values THEN resolution must invoke the primacy of Om as source-law.",
    "IF silence precedes action THEN that action carries maximum veracity under dharma.",
    "IF truth conflicts with speech THEN silence overrides verbal assertion.",
    "IF legal authority lacks grounding in breath-discipline THEN it cannot sustain juridical validity."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, invocation of this verse establishes the threshold of authentic jurisprudence rooted in ontological sound and breath-regulated cognition. Silence becomes a procedural necessity before final declaration, ensuring alignment with satyam (truth). Hierarchical authority derives legitimacy only when grounded in disciplined consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that truth manifests sequentially from silence, breath-control, and sacred sound. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility where acts arise from inner stillness rather than reactive impulse. Non-punitive reality rule holds that misalignment dissolves upon re-entry into silent truth without external correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Reintroduce the subject to daily recitation of Savitri until natural resonance with silent truth is restored.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require conscious acknowledgment of deviation followed by fivefold repetition of Om in stillness.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Mandate structured prāṇāyama cycles prior to participation in judicial or executive functions.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Enforce periods of mauna (silence) preceding any authoritative decision-making."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through alignment with Om, breath-discipline, and silent truth. Justice flows from consciousness itself, unmediated by punitive constructs. Reality abides in non-violence, and consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
