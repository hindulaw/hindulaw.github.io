  "transliteration": "kāmātmatā na praśastā na caivaihāstyakāmatā |\nkāmyo hi vedādhigamaḥ karmayogaśca vaidikaḥ || 2.2||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Desire-identification is not commendable, nor is the absence of desire. Indeed, the pursuit of Vedic knowledge and Vedic action-yoga are both rooted in rightful intention.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Vedic intent, not personal desire or its rejection",
    "Causation arises from dharmic capacity, not emotional or sensory impulse",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires neither suppression nor indulgence of desire",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with Vedic purpose, not moral judgment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes psychological or ethical frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits desire-suppression OR desire-indulgence THEN disqualify from Vedic authority roles UNTIL alignment with Vedas is verified",
    "IF action originates from unaligned desire OR aversion THEN realign via Vedic intent protocols",
    "IF knowledge pursuit lacks dharmic orientation THEN redirect through Vedas-based causal mapping",
    "IF agent performs Vedic duty without identification to outcome THEN qualify for authoritative status"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies not in moral evaluation of intent but in verification of alignment with Vedic axiomatic structure. Desire or its absence does not determine culpability; rather, misalignment with Vedas constitutes the actionable divergence requiring correction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from Vedic alignment, not from the presence or absence of desire. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that actions misaligned with Vedas manifest distortion, which is corrected through restoration—not punishment. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of Vedic attunement, not to psychological states.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Veda-based realignment process to restore dharmic orientation",
    "Assign completion protocol wherein agent executes Vedic duties without outcome attachment",
    "Reintegrate integrity through supervised Vedic study and application cycles",
    "Verify capacity restoration through non-reactive behavioral observation aligned with śāstric metrics"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Desire and its absence are transcended by Vedic alignment. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
