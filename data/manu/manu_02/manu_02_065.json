  "transliteration": "keśāntaḥ ṣoḍaśe varṣe brāhmaṇasya vidhīyate | rājanyabandho dvāviṃśe vaiśyasya dvyadhike mataḥ || 2.65||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The sacred tonsure (keśānta) is ordained for the Brahmin at sixteen years; for the Kshatriya at twenty-two; and for the Vaishya, two years more than that.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from spiritual readiness, not chronological age alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with varna-dharma and individual development stage",
    "Causation in ritual timing ensures optimal consciousness alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through precise developmental sequencing",
    "Consciousness alignment requires calibrated temporal thresholds"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF varna = 'Brahmin' AND age >= 16 THEN keśānta仪式 IS executable",
    "IF varna = 'Kshatriya' AND age >= 22 THEN keśānta仪式 IS executable",
    "IF varna = 'Vaishya' AND age >= 24 THEN keśānta仪式 IS executable",

    "ALL keśānta仪式 MUST INCLUDE consciousness_validation_check PRIOR TO execution"

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudicates eligibility disputes based on documented spiritual maturity indicators rather than birth-based claims. Burden of proof lies on demonstrating alignment with prescribed chronological and consciousness benchmarks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that keśānta timing follows sequential unfoldment per varna-dharmic structure. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures no premature activation disrupts karmic-integrity. Proportional responsibility arises only when capacity is manifest. Non-punitive reality rule confirms misalignment creates self-correcting disharmony, not external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process upon reaching designated age threshold",
    "Assign mentorship protocol until consciousness validation achieved",
    "Reintegrate missed samskāra through guided ritual completion sequence",
    "Restore integrity via supervised community acknowledgment ceremony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ordinance originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through proper observance of keśānta according to varna-timed unfolding. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone serves as ultimate adjudicator."
