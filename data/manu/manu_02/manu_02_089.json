  "transliteration": "ekādaśendriyāṇy āhur yāni pūrve manīṣiṇaḥ |\ntāni samyak pravakṣyāmi yathāvad anupūrvaśaḥ || 2.89||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The eleven sense organs, as declared by ancient seers, are now to be fully expounded in their sequential order according to their true nature.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the cognition of the Self beyond sensory limitation.",
    "Causation arises through correct knowledge of the instruments of perception and action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness of the functioning of the senses.",
    "Restoration logic requires re-alignment with the witnessing consciousness behind all faculties.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when one recognizes the distinction between the senses and the Seer."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being identifies exclusively with sensory impulses THEN capacity for dharma-based decision-making is diminished UNTIL recognition of the witnessing Self is restored.",
    "WHEN sensory identification overrides discriminative awareness THEN intervention must occur through consciousness-realigning protocols NOT punitive measures.",
    "ALL actions driven by unchecked sensory impulse MUST BE addressed via completion processes that restore integrity to the sensory system AND elevate identification to the witness state.",
    "THE legal subject retains full agency WHEN able to distinguish between sensory stimulus and conscious response.",
    "RESTORATION OF RESPONSIBILITY requires direct engagement with the sequential process of sense mastery as outlined in the Vedantic cognition sequence."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, cases involving impulsive acts rooted in uncontrolled sensory identification shall be evaluated based on the degree of Self-awareness present at time of action. The threshold of responsibility lies not in external conduct alone but in the internal capacity to recognize and disidentify from sensory dominance. Authority over such matters rests with those trained in consciousness discrimination, ensuring justice aligns with ontological truth rather than behavioral conformity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that right knowledge leads to mastery over the senses; thus causality flows from cognition, not compulsion. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility by tracing the sequential descent into sensory misidentification and providing corresponding steps for reascent. Non-punitivity is maintained by addressing root ignorance rather than manifest behavior, affirming reality as inherently just when consciousness is properly aligned.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sequential sensory awareness training to restore discriminative intelligence.",
    "Engage the actor in witnessing practices to reestablish identification with pure consciousness.",
    "Implement completion rituals to dissolve residual karmic impressions tied to sensory indulgence.",
    "Assign service-oriented tasks designed to redirect sensory energy toward dharmic outcomes.",
    "Facilitate guru-disciple dialogue to activate higher cognitive states beyond sensory dependency."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of this Dharma. The eleven senses are instruments under the governance of the Witnessing Self. Justice prevails when alignment with this Self is restored. There is no punishment—only realignment. Reality responds to consciousness. Dharma is hereby executed."
