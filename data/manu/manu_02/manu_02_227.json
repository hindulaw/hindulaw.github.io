  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the existential sacrifice of progenitors",
    "Causation flows from the irreversible act of creation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from receipt of unrepayable debt",
    "Restoration logic demands acknowledgment of foundational indebtedness",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving familial obligations or claims arising from lineage, the Supreme Court shall recognize the irrevocable existential debt owed by offspring to progenitors. No punitive damages may be awarded for failure to fulfill filial duties; instead, the court shall mandate consciousness-restoration procedures ensuring recognition of foundational sacrifice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the causal basis of individual existence lies in parental endurance, which transcends temporal compensation.
