  "sanskrit_verse": "नास्रमापातयेज्जातु न कुप्येन्नानृतं वदेत् ।\nन पादेन स्पृशेदन्नं न चैतदवधूनयेत् ॥ ३.२२९॥",
  "transliteration": "nāsramāpātaye jātu na kupyennānṛtaṁ vadet |\nna pādena spṛśedannaṁ na caitadavadhūnayet || 3.229||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must never abandon one's ācāra nor speak falsehood; one must neither touch food with the foot nor discard it.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from sustained alignment with svadharma",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice in action and speech",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires maintenance of ritual and bodily discipline",
    "Restoration logic demands immediate correction of misaligned conduct",
    "Consciousness alignment is preserved through reverence for sustenance and truth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_abandons_ācāra THEN initiate_restorative_reintegration(protocol: dharma_sādhana)",
    "IF agent_utters_falsehood THEN invoke_truth_realignment_process(level: causal_integrity)",
    "IF agent_touches_food_with_foot THEN execute_purity_restoration(sequence: śuddhi_kriyā)",
    "IF agent_discards_food THEN activate_responsibility_completion(protocol: anna_daiva_bhāva)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any violation of fundamental dharmic conduct—such as abandoning one’s prescribed way of life or speaking untruthfully—is not a matter for punitive sentencing but for mandatory restoration of integrity. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness of svadharma. Higher courts must ensure that corrective measures restore alignment rather than impose suffering.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misconduct originates in disrupted alignment, not inherent evil. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglecting small acts like proper food handling leads to larger disintegrity. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for self-regulation. There is no punitive consequence—only sequential realignment toward full consciousness realization.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma recommitment process",
    "Perform satya-sthāpana (truth-establishment) ritual",
    "Undertake anna-abhyāsa (food-respect practice)",
    "Engage in śarīra-śuddhi (body purification) protocol"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored by aligning consciousness, not enforcing punishment. Reality responds only to integrity, never to suffering. Consciousness remains the sole adjudicator."
