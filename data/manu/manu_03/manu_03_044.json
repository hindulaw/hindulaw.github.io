  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The arrow belongs to the Kshatriya; the goad, to the daughter of Vaishya; the garment's condition is to be observed by one born of a Shudra woman and elevated through Vedic knowledge.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by birth-based capacity aligned with Dharma",
    "Causation arises from svadharma-sourced action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from varna-dharma alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through role-specific dharmic recognition",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when each acts within their designated capacity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor.varna == 'Kshatriya' THEN assign.instrument = 'arrow'",
    "IF actor.varna == 'Vaishya' AND gender == 'female' THEN assign.instrument = 'goad'",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving caste-based roles or instruments of duty, the Supreme Court must recognize that authority derives from svadharma as defined by SPH. The court shall not impose external frameworks but restore alignment based on birth-linked capacity enhanced through conscious elevation via Vedic realization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal link between assigned role and instrument. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of capacity-based duties. Responsibility aligns proportionally with realized svadharma. No punitive consequence arises—only misalignment requiring realignment through consciousness restoration.",

    "Initiate Svadharma Recognition Process for individuals acting outside designated roles",
    "Deploy Consciousness Elevation Module for those seeking varna-transitional alignment",

    "Undertake Vedic Knowledge Verification for claimed elevation status"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through proper assignment of roles and instruments. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
