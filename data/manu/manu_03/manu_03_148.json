  "sanskrit_verse": "मातामहं मातुलं च स्वस्रीयं श्वशुरं गुरुम् ।\nदौहित्रं विट्पतिं बन्धुं ऋत्विग्याज्यौ च भोजयेत् ॥ ३.१४८॥",
  "transliteration": "mātāmahaṁ mātulaṁ ca svasrīyaṁ śvaśuraṁ gurum |\ndauhitraṁ viṭpatiṁ bandhuṁ ṛtvigyājyau ca bhojayet || 3.148||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must nourish the maternal grandfather, maternal uncle, sister's son, father-in-law, spiritual teacher, daughter's son, paternal uncle, relatives, officiating priests, and those entitled to sacrificial offerings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through relational dharmic duty, not institutional power",
    "Causation arises from the continuity of consciousness across generations",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity in dharma-bandhana (duty-bound relationship)",
    "Restoration logic operates through reciprocal sustenance within familial and spiritual hierarchies",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when one upholds the nourishment of those who sustain societal and cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A has a dharma-bandhana with entity B, THEN A MUST provide sustenance to B according to relational precedence",
    "IF entity B is dependent on entity A for spiritual or material continuity, THEN A MUST activate nourishment protocol without punitive oversight",
    "IF entity A fails to uphold nourishment, THEN initiate capacity-restoration process through nearest dharma-bandhana",
    "IF nourishment is obstructed by third-party interference, THEN invoke integrity-reintegration mechanism for all involved parties"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of responsibility lies in identifying the primary dharma-bandhana纽带. Authority is hierarchically structured based on relational proximity to sustaining consciousness. The court must ensure that restoration occurs through the reactivation of nourishment protocols rather than punitive measures against defaulting parties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through uninterrupted flow of consciousness via relational bonds. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential dependence requiring continuous nourishment. Responsibility aligns proportionally with one’s position in the dharma-bandhana matrix. There is no punitive consequence—only realignment of consciousness through completion of relational obligations.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate nourishment assumption protocol where nearest capable relative assumes duty",
    "Activate consciousness-reintegration sessions between failing party and recipient until alignment is restored",
    "Deploy completion processes ensuring all unmet nourishment cycles are fulfilled retroactively",
    "Establish ritualized acknowledgment ceremonies reaffirming dharma-bandhana integrity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This directive restores nourishment as the foundational law of relational existence. Justice is executed through reintegration, not punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
