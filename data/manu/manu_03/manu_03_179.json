  "transliteration": "vedavid cāpi vipro 'sya lobhāt kṛtvā pratigraham |\nvināśaṁ vrajati kṣipram āmapātram ivāmbhasi || 3.179||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Even a Vedic scholar Brahmin, if he accepts gifts out of greed, swiftly proceeds to ruin, like water poured into an impure vessel.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is conditional upon alignment with dharma, not mere scholarly status",
    "Causation arises from the motive of greed, not the act of receiving alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes that spiritual knowledge obligates purity of conduct",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of the cause of degradation before reintegration",
    "Consciousness alignment requires the abandonment of greed as a precondition for societal harmony"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person in spiritual authority accepts offerings driven by greed THEN their capacity for dharmic guidance is automatically suspended",
    "IF spiritual misconduct occurs due to greed THEN initiate automatic integrity restoration protocol before re-engagement in dharma duties",
    "IF a learned individual violates dharma through desire THEN trigger consciousness realignment process而非 punitive measures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating cases involving spiritual leaders or scholars accused of financial impropriety, the Supreme Court must assess intent rooted in greed rather than the transaction itself. Authority derived from learning does not exempt one from accountability when greed distorts dharma. The court's role is to restore integrity, not impose punishment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that greed, not the receipt of gifts, is the causal factor leading to downfall. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that the sequence begins with internal corruption, followed by loss of spiritual efficacy. Responsibility is proportional to the level of awareness and breach. As per non-punitive reality rule, the focus is on realigning consciousness rather than inflicting consequences.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein the individual returns or sanctifies all improperly received items",
    "Enforce assumption-of-responsibility ceremony where the individual publicly acknowledges deviation from dharma",
    "Undertake capacity restoration via guided introspection and purification rituals under qualified supervision",
    "Implement integrity reintegration pathway involving supervised service to reaffirm commitment to dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through consciousness realignment. There is no punishment—only the natural consequence of misaligned action. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
