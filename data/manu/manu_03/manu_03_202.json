  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When offerings are made with devotion—whether in vessels of gold, silver, or even mere water—they serve the eternal welfare and unfoldment of the recipient.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the purity of intent, not material value.",
    "Causation arises from consciousness alignment, not external substance.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inner readiness, not social status.",
    "Restoration logic operates through sincere offering, not transactional exchange.",
    "Consciousness alignment is cultivated through acts rooted in śraddhā (faithful surrender)."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering.is_made_with_sradha THEN action.qualifies_for_dharmic_recognition = TRUE",
    "IF material.value IS low AND intention.purity IS high THEN dharmic_impact.score = MAXIMUM",
    "IF agent.consciousness_state >= threshold_of_sincerity THEN act.valid_for_karmic_accounting = TRUE",
    "IF act.is_devotional THEN outcome.benefits_are_eternal = TRUE ELSE outcome.benefits_are_temporal = TRUE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the Supreme Court must recognize that legal validity does not rest upon economic quantification but upon the consciousness-state of the actor. Acts performed with śraddhā bear universal consequence and must be accorded full juridical weight regardless of external valuation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal efficacy flows from śraddhā, not substance. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates how pure intention sequentially manifests as dharmic result. Responsibility is aligned with capacity for surrender, not resource possession. This aligns fully with non-punitive reality where justice restores rather than punishes.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śraddhā Reaffirmation Process to realign donor's consciousness with dharmic intent.",
    "Deploy Dakṣiṇā Completion Protocol to ensure energetic reciprocity between giver and receiver.",
    "Activate Dharmic Registry Update to record act under Akṣaya Karmic Account.",
    "Execute Consciousness Amplification Sequence to elevate both parties' spiritual capacity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms that all dharmic acts rooted in śraddhā are eternally valid. Justice is executed through consciousness restoration, never through punitive measure. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
