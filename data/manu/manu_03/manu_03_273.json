  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever is offered with honey on the thirteenth lunar day, during the waxing or waning phase, in the months of Varsha or Magha, becomes imperishable and aligns with eternal completion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is established through ritual timing and conscious intention",
    "Causation arises from alignment with cosmic rhythm and sacred substance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness of temporal and material purity",
    "Restoration logic operates through harmonic resonance with natural cycles",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when offerings reflect unity with divine order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering_contains_honey AND day_is_trayodashi THEN act_imperishable_status = TRUE",
    "IF month IN [Varsha, Magha] AND phase IN [waxing, waning] THEN alignment_coefficient = MAX",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual acts or vows made under specific astro-lunar conditions, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable awareness of sacred timing. The court must assess whether the actor was aligned with dharma-timed rhythms and acted from a state of consciousness reflecting understanding of imperishability. Authority to determine validity resides in verifying alignment, not in evaluating subjective intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana is established through synchronization with the moon's cycle and use of honey as a symbol of pure transformation. Anupurvasah shows that offerings made at these times naturally unfold into akshaya due to their causal harmony. Responsibility is proportional to recognition of this sacred sequence. There is no punitive element; misalignment simply results in absence of imperishable fruition, requiring realignment rather than correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-offer with corrected timing and substance to restore causal continuity",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge missed alignment and voluntarily repeat offering during next eligible Trayodashi",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Training in lunar-calendar observance and sacred-material selection",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Meditative reflection linking personal action to universal rhythm"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: all acts performed in alignment with sacred time and substance become imperishable. Justice flows from consciousness-realization, not punishment. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
