  "transliteration": "aninditaiḥ strīvivāhair anindyā bhavati prajā |\nninditair ninditā nṝṇāṃ tasmān nindyān vivarjayet || 3.42||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When unions occur with women who are free from blame, the progeny becomes pure; when unions occur with blameworthy persons, the offspring bear that blemish—therefore, one must avoid all blameworthy connections.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in purity of lineage and union",
    "Causation flows through conscious selection and relational integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes the duty to preserve generational sanctity",
    "Restoration logic requires severance from corrupting influences",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates rejection of associations that degrade dharmic potential"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a union involves a person marked by societal or karmic impurity THEN disallow continuation of such lineage-forming bonds",
    "IF an individual knowingly enters a contaminated relational field THEN restrict their eligibility for custodial or procreative roles",
    "IF evidence shows degradation in familial or social conduct due to prior association THEN initiate separation protocol without punitive intent",
    "IF a citizen demonstrates repeated disregard for dharmic relational standards THEN realign access to reproductive or leadership capacities"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving family law, inheritance rights, or guardianship, the Supreme Court shall assess relational integrity as foundational to legal capacity. Where contamination arises from improper unions, judicial action must focus on restoring purity of lineage rather than imposing punitive sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Truth-discernment (Pramāṇa) reveals that character defects manifest sequentially (Anupūrvaśaḥ) through relational choices.
