  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A full year's nourishment is achieved through cow’s milk and rice pudding; similarly, the satisfaction of a twelve-year-old boy is fulfilled by the meat of a goat sacrificed in accordance with Vedic injunctions.",

The court must ensure that guardians execute dharmically-prescribed sustenance protocols without deferral to external jurisprudential frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that physiological and spiritual nourishment are inseparable when sourced from Vedic sacrifice. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation of satiation through correct substances offered at correct times.
