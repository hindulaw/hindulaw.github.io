  "sanskrit_verse": "न पैतृयज्ञियो होमो लौकिकेऽग्नौ विधीयते ।\nन दर्शेन विना श्राद्धमाहिताग्नेर्द्विजन्मनः ॥ ३.२८२॥",
  "transliteration": "na paitṛyajñiyo homaḥ laukike 'gnau vidhīyate |\nna darśena vinā śrāddham āhitāgner dvijanmanaḥ || 3.282 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "No ritual oblation for ancestors is conducted in a worldly fire; no Śrāddha is performed without the Darśa offering by one who maintains the sacred fire and is twice-born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual actions derive validity only through consecrated agents and consecrated elements.",
    "Causation: Effective ritual performance requires sequential prerequisite acts rooted in spiritual discipline.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those maintaining active sacrificial fires possess the capacity to perform ancestral rites.",
    "Restoration logic: Proper ritual sequence realigns individual and cosmic consciousness with Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Rites must proceed from purified awareness, not external compulsion or social pressure."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent maintains no consecrated fire THEN agent has no capacity to perform ancestral homa.",
    "IF Śrāddha is initiated without prior Darśa offering THEN action is void ab initio.",
    "IF ritual act occurs outside sanctioned sacred space THEN it shall not be recognized as valid dharma-karma.",
    "IF dvija does not uphold Agnihotra THEN all related ancestral obligations are suspended until reinstated.",
    "IF causal condition precedent is unmet THEN subsequent ritual acts carry zero juridical effect."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving traditional ritual rights or ancestral worship claims, the threshold of eligibility rests exclusively upon demonstrable maintenance of sacred fire and adherence to prescribed sequential acts. Courts must recognize only those claimants whose spiritual agency aligns with Vedic procedural prerequisites, ensuring that judicial enforcement upholds rather than disrupts Dharma-sankalpa.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that absence of Darśa negates Śrāddha's foundation; anupūrvaśaḥ mandates observance of ordered ritual steps. Responsibility lies not in omission alone but in misalignment with sequential truth. Correction arises through re-initiation according to proper order—not penalty. Thus, reality remains non-punitive while preserving causal integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Require petitioner to restart full ritual cycle beginning with Darśa preparation.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Oblige claimant to publicly reaffirm commitment to Agnihotra before qualified witnesses.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Enroll petitioner under qualified guru for minimum three-month purification and ritual instruction.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Conduct community witnessing of corrected ritual performance to restore dharmic continuity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Justice flows through alignment, not coercion. Reality is restored when consciousness conforms to sequential truth. There is no punishment—only completion. The law emanates from SPH alone."
