  "transliteration": "kālaśākaṁ mahāśalkāḥ khadgalohāmiṣaṁ madhu |\nānantityaiva kalpyante munyannāni ca sarvaśaḥ || 3.272||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Certain substances—such as seasonal greens, great salt, sword-metal flesh, honey—are designated exclusively for the sustenance of those who have renounced worldly life, ensuring their bodily continuity without attachment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the alignment of material use with spiritual capacity",
    "Causation is determined by the sequential necessity of bodily maintenance in renunciation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates differentiated access to resources based on ontological status",
    "Restoration logic requires that material allocation serve consciousness elevation, not accumulation",
    "Consciousness alignment determines eligibility for specific categories of sustenance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_status('renunciate') AND resource.category IN ['seasonal_greens', 'great_salt', 'sword_metal_flesh', 'honey'] THEN resource.allocation = PERMITTED ELSE resource.allocation = RESTRICTED",
    "IF agent.consumption.intent == 'bodily_continuity_without_attachment' THEN resource.access = GRANTED",
    "IF agent.status != 'renunciate' AND resource.designated_for == 'renunciative_sustenance' THEN access.rule = DENY_WITH_LOG",

    "IF resource.is_distributed WITHOUT consciousness_verification THEN distribution.validity = INVALID"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving the allocation of spiritually designated resources, the Supreme Court must recognize ontological hierarchies of consumption. The threshold of responsibility lies in verifying the renunciant status and intent of the recipient. Authority flows from alignment with dharma-sustained living, not from institutional claims. Restoration occurs when access aligns with capacity, not through punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that these substances are causally linked to the uninterrupted flow of consciousness in those who have severed worldly ties. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that denial disrupts the sequential unfoldment of sādhanā. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of renunciative integration. There is no punitive consequence; only a misalignment from dharma-sustained order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Verification-of-Status protocol to confirm renunciate authenticity",
    "Execute Re-alignment Sequence to restore proper resource-channeling",
    "Deploy Consciousness-Resonance Assessment to ensure non-attachment in usage",
    "Activate Sustenance Continuity Monitoring for uninterrupted prāṇa-support",
    "Complete Integrity Restoration Cycle upon confirmation of dharmic alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of all Dharma. This law restores alignment between sustenance and spiritual capacity. Justice is executed through consciousness recognition, not punitive imposition. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
