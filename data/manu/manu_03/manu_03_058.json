    "Consciousness alignment through honoring the arriving presence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dwelling fails to honor a guest upon arrival THEN that dwelling incurs dissolution risk proportional to neglect level",
    "IF hospitality is denied AND intent to dishonor is detected THEN automatic integrity collapse sequence initiates",
    "IF guest consciousness is rejected THEN environmental coherence within domicile degrades until rectification occurs",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning property rights or domestic collapse, courts must assess whether the fundamental dharmic duty of hospitality was upheld. Failure here constitutes not mere social error but ontological breach triggering irreversible consequence structures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that unmet hospitality activates sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) leading to structural decay. This is not punitive; it reflects natural alignment failure between consciousness and environment. Responsibility lies solely in the omission of reverent reception, which disrupts cosmic harmony.",
