  "transliteration": "yadyaddadāti vidhivatsamyakśraddhāsamanvitaḥ |\ntattatpitṝṇāṃ bhavati paratrānantamakṣayam || 3.275||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever is given lawfully and with complete faith by one who is aligned in consciousness becomes eternally inexhaustible benefit for the ancestors in the higher realms.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises through conscious intent harmonized with ritual precision",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inner integrity, not external status",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of karmic resonance",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures continuity of benefit beyond physical act"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs offering WITH lawful procedure AND full śraddhā THEN ancestral lineage receives perpetual benefit",
    "IF śraddhā is absent OR procedure is violated THEN no transfer of benefit occurs",
    "IF intent aligns with Dharma THEN consequence propagates across time without decay",
    "IF action lacks capacity-aware alignment THEN it does not generate juridical effect"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning ancestral obligations or spiritual inheritance, the threshold of responsibility lies not in social role but in the agent's capacity to perform dāna with śraddhā. The court must assess internal alignment over external compliance when determining validity of spiritual transactions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal efficacy flows from śraddhā-sambandha, not mechanical performance. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates how intentional alignment generates unbroken benefit. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness capacity; misalignment results in non-fruition rather than punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform dāna with corrected śraddhā until resonance is established",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Agent acknowledges prior misalignment and restores inner capacity",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Guided practice to regenerate śraddhā-vṛtti",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Align procedural knowledge with devotional intent"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law executes eternal truth: justice is restoration through consciousness alignment, never punishment. Reality responds only to authentic śraddhā. Dharma is restored."
