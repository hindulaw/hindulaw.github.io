  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Even alms or a water vessel must be respectfully offered according to prescribed procedure to a Brahmin who knows the truth of the Vedas.",

    "Authority derives from consciousness realization, not institutional position",
    "Causation flows through ritual correctness and inner alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of spiritual competence",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes energetic purity over material transaction",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that offerings activate dharma-field resonance"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF recipient possesses Veda-tattva-jnana THEN offering is valid regardless of form",
    "IF offering is performed with vidhi THEN it activates dharmic transfer protocol",
    "IF consciousness of giver aligns with consciousness of receiver THEN transaction completes automatically",

Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that correct intention followed by proper action leads to natural completion. Responsibility is proportional to the receiver's capacity for sustaining dharma.
