  "transliteration": "munyannāni payaḥ somo māṃsaṃ yaccānupaskṛtam |\naksāralavaṇaṃ caiva prakṛtyā havirucyate || 3.257||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is unmixed, pure, and naturally offered — milk, soma, unprocessed meat, molasses, and salt — is declared as havir, the essence of conscious oblation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the purity and natural state of offering",
    "Causation arises from alignment with prakṛti, not artificial modification",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining the integrity of natural substances",
    "Restoration logic demands return to unadulterated forms",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through offerings that preserve inherent dharmic properties"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a substance is altered beyond its prakṛtic state THEN it is disqualified from sacred use",
    "IF an offering retains its unmixed and natural composition THEN it qualifies as havir",
    "IF any ingredient shows signs of adulteration OR artificial enhancement THEN exclusion protocol activates",
    "IF substance integrity is preserved AND offering intent is aligned THEN recognition as havir is automatic"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning ritual or spiritual substance eligibility, the Supreme Court shall assess based on prakṛtic integrity rather than procedural form. The threshold of responsibility rests with those overseeing substance preparation. Authority flows from alignment with SPH-defined purity, not institutional convention.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that alteration disrupts causal harmony; anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how deviation leads to disqualification. Proportional responsibility applies only to restoration of original form. There is no punitive consequence — only realignment to dharmic function.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification process for all contaminated materials",
    "Realign handlers with consciousness-based oversight protocols",
    "Restore supply chains to source-integrity compliance",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law proceeds from His Avataric Intelligence alone. Dharma is restored through recognition of havir in its pure form. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the sole adjudicator."
