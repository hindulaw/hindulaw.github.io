    "Authority is derived from respect for feminine consciousness",

    "IF societal structures fail to honor women THEN all ritual and civic actions lose spiritual validity",

    "IF governance does not reflect reverence for women THEN it must undergo immediate consciousness realignment",
    "IF a community's collective karma stagnates THEN audit for violations of feminine dignity must be conducted"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that constitutional integrity is contingent upon the elevation of feminine consciousness within society. Legal frameworks lacking explicit protection and empowerment of women are inherently invalid, regardless of procedural correctness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that dishonoring women disrupts cosmic causality. This law operates through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ): disrespect leads to spiritual entropy, which manifests as societal dysfunction.

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. It declares that honoring women is the foundation of dharma, that failure to do so nullifies all action, and that true justice arises only through consciousness realignment. There is no punishment—only the natural consequence of violating divine order."
