  "sanskrit_verse": "भुक्तवत्स्वथ विप्रेषु स्वेषु भृत्येषु चैव हि ।\nभुञ्जीयातां ततः पश्चादवशिष्टं तु दम्पती ॥ ३.११६॥",
  "transliteration": "bhuktavatsva atha vipreṣu sveṣu bhṛtyeṣu caiva hi |\nbhuñjīyātāṁ tataḥ paścād avaśiṣṭaṁ tu dampatī || 3.116||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "After feeding the Brahmins, one's own servants, and other dependents, the remainder shall be enjoyed by the married couple.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from sacrificial duty fulfilled towards higher spiritual orders",
    "Causation is established through sequential service obligations before personal enjoyment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires householders to prioritize sustenance of spiritual and dependent structures",
    "Restoration logic ensures that material surplus arises only after sacred and social debts are settled",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through structured renunciation prior to relational enjoyment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF household has completed offerings to Brahmins AND provided for all domestic dependents THEN surplus assets MAY BE utilized by married couple",
    "IF any dependent group remains unfed OR unprovided PRIOR TO marital consumption THEN access to remaining resources IS DENIED until completion",
    "IF resource distribution sequence IS violated THEN automatic suspension of entitlement rights UNTIL restitution protocol completes",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected via audit THEN mandatory realignment process initiated through supervised redistribution cycle"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving inheritance or familial asset division, the threshold of lawful entitlement rests upon demonstrable fulfillment of pre-existing dharmic obligations. Courts must verify that priority was given to spiritual authorities and domestic dependents before recognizing claims of conjugal enjoyment. Where such precedence is absent, restoration occurs through retroactive compliance rather than punitive seizure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal dependency: prosperity manifests only after honoring those who sustain cosmic and social order. Anupūrvaśaḥ mandates that neglecting earlier duties invalidates later claims. Responsibility aligns proportionally with capacity to serve first. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that deprivation results naturally from omission, not imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establish correct sequence of offerings and provisions under supervision",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require acknowledgment and execution of omitted duties",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide support systems ensuring future adherence to proper sequence",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Conduct ceremonial reaffirmation of dharma-based economic order"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This verse executes Dharma through ordered consumption, affirming that surplus emerges only after sacred and social debts are honored. Justice restores alignment through conscious sequencing, not punitive consequence. Reality responds to integrity, not judgment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
