    "Authority flows from dietary discipline as a reflection of inner governance",
    "Causation arises through alignment with natural dharmic rhythms in sustenance",

    "Consciousness alignment is maintained or disturbed via adherence to prescribed dietary conduct"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving public health, environmental degradation, or cultural integrity related to food consumption, the Court shall apply these axioms to assess causal responsibility rooted in energetic consequence rather than punitive fault. The threshold of authority lies in determining whether the act was performed knowingly within the framework of dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that specific meats induce measurable durations of bodily and mental satisfaction, indicating their influence on subtle energy bodies.
