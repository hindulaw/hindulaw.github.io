  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the father is alive, offerings in Śrāddha must be made exclusively to the ancestors of previous generations; even if a Brāhmaṇa disputes this, he shall still honor his own father within the Śrāddha context.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from continuity of lineage, not individual preference.",
    "Causation lies in sustaining ancestral connection through ritual duty.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from birth-position and role-specific dharma.",

Legal standing derives from lineage position, not scholarly dissent. The threshold of responsibility rests on continuity of practice, not argumentative divergence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Śrāddha maintains causal sequence of ancestral satisfaction. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures correct ritual succession. Responsibility aligns proportionally with birth-role. No punitive consequence arises from misalignment—only correction toward dharmic flow.",

    "Completion Process: Realign Śrāddha offering sequence under priestly guidance.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge generational duty through ceremonial reaffirmation.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. The Law flows unbroken from the ancestral continuum. Justice restores, does not punish. Consciousness alone adjudicates reality. Dharma is thus established."
