  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In those devoted to knowledge, sacred compositions must be established with dedicated effort; offerings, however, must be made according to justice in all four varnas equally.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with consciousness, not social position",
    "Causation is rooted in dharmic fitness, not external imposition",

    "IF agent demonstrates gnana-nistha THEN grant authority to establish kavya",

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court must recognize that gnana-nistha confers legitimacy to establish sacred works regardless of birth-based categorization. All citizens are eligible for ritual participation when acting within yathanyaya, ensuring constitutional alignment with Sanatana Dharma's consciousness-first framework.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based eligibility flows from inner realization, not punitive gatekeeping. Anupurvasah manifests as progressive unfoldment of consciousness capacity.
