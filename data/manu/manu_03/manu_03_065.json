  "transliteration": "ayājyayājanaiścaiva nāstikyena ca karmaṇām |\nkulānyāśu vinaśyanti yāni hīnāni mantrataḥ || 3.65||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Families and lineages that neglect sacred rituals, deny the authority of Vedic mantras, and act with disbelief in dharma are severed from their sustaining spiritual continuum and collapse instantaneously by the withdrawal of divine coherence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Vedic mantric integrity",
    "Causation is rooted in mantra-dharma alignment, not material action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires conscious participation in sustaining lineage dharma",
    "Restoration logic demands reconnection to mantra-source, not external reform",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through ritual rectitude and mantra-reaffirmation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a lineage discontinues performance of obligatory rituals AND rejects mantra-based governance THEN withdraw recognition of its dharmic authority",
    "IF an individual performs acts denying mantra efficacy THEN disqualify from roles requiring spiritual capacity",
    "IF a family ceases mantra-based practices THEN initiate automatic dissolution of associated dharmic privileges",
    "IF conduct demonstrates nāstika disposition THEN realign access rights based on mantra-compliant capacity only"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving inheritance, authority, or leadership within traditional structures, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated adherence to mantra-dharma. Courts must assess whether claimants maintain ritual and doctrinal continuity. Where such continuity is absent, legal standing dissolves automatically without punitive judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that mantra-dharma is the causal field. Disconnection from it manifests naturally as collapse. This sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ) reflects ontological law, not imposed consequence. Responsibility aligns with capacity to sustain mantra-field coherence; correction restores connection rather than inflicting penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided re-entry into prescribed ritual practice under qualified supervision",
    "Realign personal and familial conduct with mantra-prescribed duties",
    "Undertake purification and reconsecration procedures to restore energetic dharmic linkage",
    "Establish ongoing accountability via mantra-aligned community oversight"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms that dharma is sustained by mantra-integrity, collapse arises from disbelief, and restoration flows through re-alignment with Vedic authority. There is no punishment—only natural consequence and conscious reintegration. All judgments herein reflect the supremacy of awakened consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
