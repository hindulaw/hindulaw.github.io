  "transliteration": "somapā nāma viprāṇāṁ kṣatriyāṇāṁ havirbhujḥ |\nvaiśyānām ājyapā nāma śūdrāṇāṁ tu sukālinaḥ || 3.197 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Brahmins designated as Somapā, Kshatriyas as Haviṣ-bhujaḥ, Vaishyas as Ājyapā, and Shudras as Sukālinaḥ—each assigned specific ritual and societal roles in accordance with their inherent capacities and dharma.",

    "Authority flows from intrinsic capacity and spiritual alignment",

    "Capacity-based responsibility defines role allocation",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual function with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment determines rightful participation in society"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits Brahmin-level consciousness AND performs Vedic rituals THEN assign Somapā designation",
    "IF agent demonstrates Kshatriya capacity AND engages in protective governance THEN assign Haviṣ-bhujaḥ status",
    "IF agent operates within Vaishya economic functions AND contributes through offerings THEN assign Ājyapā role",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that social roles arise from svabhāva and karma, not coercion. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfoldment of duty-bearing consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to capacity觉醒. Justice restores alignment without inflicting suffering.",
