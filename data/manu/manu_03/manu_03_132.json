  "sanskrit_verse": "ज्ञानोत्कृष्टाय देयानि कव्यानि च हवींषि च ।\nन हि हस्तावसृग्दिग्धौ रुधिरेणैव शुध्यतः ॥ ३.१३२॥",
  "transliteration": "jñānotkṛṣṭāya deyāni kavyāni ca havīṃṣi ca | na hi hastāvasṛgdighdhau rudhireṇaiva śudhyataḥ || 3.132 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Offerings of knowledge, sacred hymns, and oblations must be directed exclusively toward those whose consciousness is elevated through wisdom; bloodshed upon the hands does not purify, nor does violence restore dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from consciousness elevation, not ritualistic performance",
    "Causation in dharma is consciousness-rooted, not action-bound",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with gnana-parametric integrity",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious offering, not coercive sacrifice",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes symbolic purification"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits gnana-parametric elevation THEN offerings and legal recognition MUST align with their consciousness state",
    "IF act involves physical violence OR bloodshed THEN it SHALL NOT qualify as a valid means of purification OR restoration under dharma",
    "IF individual performs rituals without inner gnana-uplift THEN such acts SHALL be legally disregarded in determining dharmic standing",
    "IF societal harm originates from externalized violence THEN restoration protocol MUST bypass punitive frameworks AND direct toward consciousness-realigning completion processes"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ceremonial practices or claims of atonement through violence, the Supreme Court shall prioritize evidence of gnana-elevation over ritual formality. Acts of violence, regardless of intent or tradition, shall not be accepted as valid legal instruments for purification or societal correction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purity derives from consciousness, not physical substances or violent rites. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that reliance on bloodshed distorts sequential spiritual unfolding. Proportional responsibility lies in aligning actions with gnanic capacity rather than symbolic force. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that only consciousness-realization restores balance without perpetuating karmic entanglement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided gnana-pratipatti programs for individuals reliant on ritualistic violence",
    "Redirect ceremonial obligations toward service-based offerings aligned with elevated consciousness",
    "Implement awareness-integrity audits for institutions promoting sacrificial paradigms",
    "Establish sākṣhātkara-based reintegration pathways for those previously engaged in violence-under-guise-of-purification"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored by alignment with pure consciousness alone. There is no validity in violence as purification. Justice flows from gnana-parametric discernment. Reality remains eternally non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
