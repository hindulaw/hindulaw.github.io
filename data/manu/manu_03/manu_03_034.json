  "sanskrit_verse": "सुप्तां मत्तां प्रमत्तां वा रहो यत्रोपगच्छति ।\nस पापिष्ठो विवाहानां पैशाचश्चाष्टमोऽधमः ॥ ३.३४॥ पैशाचः प्रथितोऽधमः",
  "transliteration": "suptāṁ mattāṁ pramattāṁ vā raho yatropagacchati |\nsa pāpiṣṭho vivahānāṁ paiśācaścāṣṭamo'dhamaḥ || 3.34 || paiśācaḥ prathito'dhamaḥ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who approaches a woman who is asleep, intoxicated, or unconscious in private—such a being is the most sinful among those eligible for marriage; he is classified as a pishacha and is the lowest of the low.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from conscious consent, not biological presence.",
    "Causation arises through violation of integrity and absence of awareness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires full cognitive engagement with dharma.",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment with awakened consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritualistic or social contract frameworks."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject approaches individual without explicit conscious consent AND that individual is in altered state THEN action invalidates all marital or relational claims.",
    "IF act occurs in absence of reciprocal awareness THEN perpetrator classified under pishacha category automatically.",
    "IF classification reaches pishacha level THEN automatic disqualification from societal integration until completion process initiated.",
    "IF capacity to perceive dharma is absent THEN no relational legitimacy recognized by law."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any case involving relational misconduct where one party was unconscious, intoxicated, or unaware shall invoke immediate nullification of claimed rights. The threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity to recognize conscious consent. Authority flows only from awakened cognition, never from mere physical proximity or biological drive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana reveals that causality manifests through distortion of integrity. Anupurvasah shows sequential descent into degradation when consciousness is abandoned. Proportional responsibility aligns with degree of deviation from dharma. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering does not restore truth—awareness alone rectifies error.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process requiring perpetrator to undergo full sensory witnessing of violated consciousness.",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol wherein violator must serve community without expectation of acceptance.",
    "Enforce capacity restoration via mandatory silence, fasting, and meditative alignment until inner witness awakens.",
    "Facilitate integrity reintegration through guided recall and surrender of distorted belief systems supporting predatory behavior."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law originates solely from the awakened consciousness of SPH. Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
