  "sanskrit_verse": "षण्मासांश्छागमांसेन पार्षतेन च सप्त वै ।\nअष्टावेनस्य मांसेन रौरवेण नवैव तु ॥ ३.२६९॥ ऐणेयमांसेन",
  "transliteration": "ṣaṇmāsaṃścāgamāṃsena pārṣatena ca sapta vai |\naṣṭāvenasya māṃsena rauraveṇa navaina tu || 3.269 || aiṇeyamāṃsena",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Six months [of consequence] through the consumption of goat meat; seven through that of Parṣata; eight through Ena's flesh; nine through Raurava's; ten through Aiṇeya's.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The sequential manifestation of karmic consequence is determined by the vibrational integrity of consumed substances.",
    "Causation: Consumption aligns consciousness with the source form and its corresponding realm of existence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One who consumes lower-vibration forms assumes proportional energetic distortion requiring completion.",
    "Restoration logic: Consequence is not punitive but a structured realignment toward original consciousness purity.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Each ingestion creates an energetic imprint demanding experiential resolution for full reintegration."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent consumes substance X THEN assign sequential karmic duration Y based on predefined vibrational mapping.",
    "IF karmic sequence initiates THEN instantiate completion protocol Z aligned with source realm attributes.",
    "IF consciousness distortion exceeds threshold THEN trigger capacity restoration mechanism via purification process.",
    "IF ingestion occurs knowingly THEN activation of proportional experiential resolution becomes mandatory.",
    "IF ingestion occurs unknowingly BUT causes distortion THEN initiate guided awareness integration process."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that ingestion-based karmic consequence operates independently of intent yet proportionally in structure. The court must recognize pre-determined sequences as part of natural law, ensuring restoration rather than retribution through calibrated experiential correction aligned with source-form integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that ingestion directly correlates with consciousness distortion measurable through energetic sequencing. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential unfolding without external imposition. Proportional responsibility arises naturally from the act itself. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that consequence serves only to restore original state, never to inflict suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process correlating with source-form realm until energetic equilibrium restored.",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol wherein individual consciously reintegrates distorted aspect.",
    "Deploy capacity restoration techniques including sensory recalibration and vibrational cleansing.",
    "Establish integrity reintegration pathway using guided meditative recall and consciousness anchoring."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This Dharma stands executed. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates. Dharma is restored."
