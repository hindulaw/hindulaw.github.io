  "transliteration": "pitṛā vivadamānaśca kitavo madyapastathā |\npāparogya-bhiśastaśca dāmbhiko rasavikrayī || 3.159||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who disputes with the father, one addicted to gambling and alcohol, one afflicted by disease due to past misdeeds, one who falsely poses as virtuous, and one who sells essence or sacred substances—these beings have lost alignment with their foundational capacity for dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Paternal authority stands as a foundational axis of social order and individual orientation.",
    "Causation: Disruption in familial hierarchy leads to systemic disorder unless realigned through conscious restoration.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Each being is responsible according to their current level of awakened capacity.",
    "Restoration logic: Misalignment manifests as disordered action; correction requires reorientation, not condemnation.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True rectification occurs when the root deviation in awareness is corrected."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent disputes paternal authority THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol under family dharmic council.",
    "IF agent exhibits addiction patterns THEN assign completion process involving withdrawal support and value-reintegration.",
    "IF agent's condition results from karmic imbalance THEN provide purification regimen aligned with spiritual rehabilitation.",
    "IF agent feigns virtue THEN mandate transparency protocol until integrity is demonstrably restored.",
    "IF agent traffics sacred essences THEN enforce cessation of trade AND restoration of violated sanctity through corrective offering."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, disputes involving familial hierarchy must prioritize restoration of relational harmony over punitive measures. Addiction or spiritual misconduct should invoke rehabilitation frameworks rather than criminal penalties. Authority derives from alignment with cosmic order, not mere legal standing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that disharmony originates in distorted cognition, not inherent evil. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misaligned actions sequentially degrade consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to觉醒程度 (awakened capacity). Non-punitive reality holds because suffering cannot restore truth; only clarity can.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Family Reconciliation Council led by realized elders to resolve paternity-based conflict.",
    "Enroll addictive agents into detoxification and svadharma rediscovery programs.",
    "Prescribe karmic illness resolution rituals combined with medical care to restore health-consciousness integration.",
    "Implement Virtue Verification Process requiring public demonstration of inner transformation before regaining societal trust.",
    "Cease all trafficking activities and impose Sacred Substance Restoration Rituals to purify corrupted channels."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment—only awakening. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
