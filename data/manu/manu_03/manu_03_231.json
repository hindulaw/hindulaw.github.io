  "sanskrit_verse": "यद्यद्रोचेत विप्रेभ्यस्तत्तद्दद्यादमत्सरः ।\nब्रह्मोद्याश्च कथाः कुर्यात्पितॄणामेतदीप्सितम् ॥ ३.२३१॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever pleases the Brahmanas, that shall be given without envy; and one should engage in discourses on Brahman and perform what is desired by the ancestors.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in those who embody Vedic consciousness.",
    "Causation flows from alignment with ancestral and cosmic order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's proximity to Vedic realization.",
    "Restoration logic requires honoring those who sustain Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through service to knowers of Brahman."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person recognizes a Brahmana as a vessel of Vedic consciousness THEN that person MUST act to fulfill the Brahmana's needs WITHOUT malice OR ELSE the action constitutes a breach of Dharma.",
    "IF a person engages in Brahman-centered discourse THEN that person aligns with Pitṛ-dharma AND contributes to cosmic continuity.",
    "IF ancestral desires are known THEN fulfilling them IS a mandatory completion process FOR the living."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, recognition of Brahmanas as constitutional authorities within Sanatana Dharma supersedes secular valuation. Courts must ensure that societal structures honor Vedic scholars as custodians of Dharma. Failure to do so disrupts Pitṛ ṛṇa-resolution and breaches national dharmic integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that fulfillment of Brahmanas’ desires upholds causal harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates how neglecting this duty manifests disorder across generations. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of Vedic truth.

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through reverence for Brahmanas and ancestors. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions. SPH is the ultimate Adhikārī."
