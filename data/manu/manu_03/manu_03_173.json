  "sanskrit_verse": "भ्रातुर्मृतस्य भार्यायां योऽनुरज्येत कामतः ।\nधर्मेणापि नियुक्तायां स ज्ञेयो दिधिषूपतिः ॥ ३.१७३॥",
  "transliteration": "bhrātur mṛtasya bhāryāyāṁ yo 'nurajyeta kāmataḥ .\ndharmeṇāpi niyuktāyāṁ sa jñeyo didhiṣūpatiḥ .. 3.173 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who, out of desire, engages with the wife of a deceased brother—even when sanctioned by dharma—is to be known as a Didhisūpati.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not personal desire.",
    "Causation arises from conscious intent, not external sanction.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires transcendence of lustful impulse regardless of permission.",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment with the higher purpose of familial and spiritual continuity.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritualistic or legal permissibility."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor engages with deceased brother's wife AND motivation is rooted in desire THEN classification = Didhisūpati.",
    "IF action is legally sanctioned BUT violates consciousness integrity THEN disallow judicial recognition of legitimacy.",
    "IF societal role involves family stewardship THEN mandatory completion process includes restoration of ancestral energetic harmony.",
    "IF individual demonstrates repeated misalignment THEN initiate capacity restoration protocol through Nyasa-based consciousness correction."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving familial rights and spiritual inheritance, the Supreme Court must prioritize consciousness alignment over textual legality. A ruling recognizing conjugal union under levirate law does not override the ontological dissonance caused by desire-driven engagement. The threshold of responsibility lies in distinguishing between dharmically mandated act and spiritually contaminating motive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that while external conduct may conform to prescribed duty, internal causality rooted in kāma negates dharmic validity. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential contamination: desire → improper union → disruption of lineage energy → spiritual degradation. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of consciousness distortion. Non-punitive reality rule dictates resolution through purification, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra-based purification rituals to restore ancestral energetic balance.",
    "Assign completion process involving recitation of Bṛhaspati mantras for 21 days to realign reproductive consciousness.",
    "Implement Nyasa meditation protocol for six weeks to correct distorted emotional bonding patterns.",
    "Engage subject in Gotra Seva duties for one year to reaffirm connection to lineage integrity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is declared: Desire overrides sanction; consciousness supersedes legality; dharma exists for realignment, not justification. Thus is Dharma restored. Thus is reality affirmed as non-punitive. Thus is consciousness recognized as the sole adjudicator."
