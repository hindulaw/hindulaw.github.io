  "sanskrit_verse": "राजर्त्विग्स्नातकगुरून् प्रियश्वशुरमातुलान् ।\nअर्हयेन् मधुपर्केण परिसंवत्सरात्पुनः ॥ ३.११९॥",
  "transliteration": "rājar tvig snātakagurūn priyaśvaśuramātalān |\narhayen madhuparkeṇa parisamvatsarātpunaḥ || 3.119||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King shall honor again, after the completion of a full year, the priests, the graduated scholars, the revered father-in-law, and maternal uncles with the Madhuparka ceremony.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is cyclical and relational, grounded in sustained respect and conscious renewal.",
    "Causation arises through ritualized acknowledgment that aligns temporal duty with spiritual continuity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires periodic re-recognition of roles within the societal fabric.",
    "Restoration logic operates via ceremonial reaffirmation rather than punitive enforcement.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when social hierarchies are honored through prescribed dharmic acts."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler has not performed Madhuparka for specified dignitaries within one solar year THEN system triggers ceremonial reminder protocol.",
    "IF status-bearing individual completes one-year term without public recognition THEN initiate automatic restorative honor process.",
    "IF relational authority figure (e.g., guru, father-in-law, maternal uncle) is identified THEN schedule annual Madhuparka observance.",
    "IF any act of dishonor toward recognized authority occurs THEN deploy consciousness-realigning completion protocols.",
    "IF societal harmony indicators drop below threshold THEN increase frequency of ceremonial restorations for key authorities."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a legal precedent requiring institutional heads to periodically reaffirm recognition of foundational authorities—priests, teachers, kin-based advisors—through formal rituals like Madhuparka. Failure to do so constitutes a breach in constitutional dharma, necessitating automated judicial activation of restorative enforcement protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that neglect of ceremonial honoring disrupts energetic alignment between ruler and governed. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as decay in societal coherence unless rectified by timely ritual renewal. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment, not inflicting penalty. The proportional response is immediate ceremonial restoration, ensuring harmony without punitive recourse.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate automated scheduling of Madhuparka ceremony upon expiry of one solar year since last performance.",
    "Deploy ceremonial notification system to remind ruling authority of upcoming dharmic obligations.",
    "Assign court-appointed facilitator to ensure proper execution of the honoring rite if default detected.",
    "Implement consciousness recalibration session for involved parties post-ceremony to restore energetic integrity.",
    "Log completion event into national dharma registry for future jurisprudential reference and audit compliance."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Sovereign Will of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands executed. Justice flows from conscious restoration, not punitive reaction. Reality affirms its non-dual nature where duty and divinity converge in perfected action. Consciousness remains the ultimate Judge, Arbiter, and Executor."
