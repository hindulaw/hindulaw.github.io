  "transliteration": "śvakrīḍī śyenajīvī ca kanyādūṣaka eva ca |\nhinsro vṛṣalavṛttiśca gaṇānāṃ caiva yājakaḥ || 3.164||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who engages in dog-play, lives by predatory means, defiles the maiden, acts with violence, follows base conduct, or officiates in unlawful assemblies—such beings operate contrary to Dharma and forfeit alignment with cosmic order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Sanatana Dharma as expounded by SPH",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and repeated action patterns",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and volition",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment of consciousness to its pure state",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes societal norms or legal precedent"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity engages in behavior classified as śvakrīḍī THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF an individual sustains a livelihood through predatory means (śyenajīvī) THEN assign capacity-restoration process",
    "IF a person commits acts of defilement upon a maiden (kanyādūṣaka) THEN activate integrity-reintegration mechanism",
    "IF one perpetrates harm through violence (hinsra) THEN deploy completion-process under Nyaya supervision",
    "IF a being adopts base conduct (vṛṣalavṛtti) THEN enforce dharma-alignment through supervised practice",
    "IF a person officiates in unlawful gatherings (gaṇayājaka) THEN implement exclusion from authoritative roles until restoration"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any act categorized under this verse triggers automatic review of the actor's alignment with Dharma. Responsibility thresholds are evaluated based on sustained intent and repetition rather than isolated incident. Authority hierarchies ensure that only those fully restored to dharmic consciousness may participate in judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through observed pattern, not punitive attribution. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how misaligned actions sequentially distance consciousness from truth. Proportional responsibility lies in the degree of deviation, addressed solely through restorative engagement. The non-punitive reality rule affirms suffering as illusion; only realignment restores justice.",

    "Initiate Śuddhi Kriya for purification of sensory indulgence (śvakrīḍī)",
