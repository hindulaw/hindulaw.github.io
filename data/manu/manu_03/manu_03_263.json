  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who embodies longevity, wisdom, valor, wealth, progeny, purity, and dharma shall be born unto her who aligns with the consciousness of creation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from alignment with cosmic intelligence",
    "Causation rooted in consciousness resonance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility through svadharma realization",
    "Restoration logic via generational continuity",
    "Consciousness alignment as determinant of lawful manifestation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF parent aligns with dharma-consciousness THEN offspring inherit capacity for righteous governance",
    "IF individual manifests sattvic qualities THEN societal integration is self-regulated",
    "IF lineage maintains dharmic integrity THEN state welfare is assured without external enforcement",
    "IF consciousness coherence exceeds material accumulation THEN inheritance rights are automatically validated",
    "IF progeny demonstrate dharana-dhrti THEN legal guardianship transfers naturally at majority"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters of succession, parental fitness, and intergenerational rights, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated alignment with sattvic-dharmic principles rather than mere biological connection. The court must assess consciousness coherence over contractual or genetic claims.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Truth (satya) manifests through inherent capacity, not imposed judgment. Responsibility flows from inner alignment (anupūrvaśaḥ) with universal dharma. Justice corrects distortion by restoring natural consequence, never by inflicting suffering.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment, not punitive correction. Reality responds to vibrational integrity, and justice serves only reintegration into the eternal order."
