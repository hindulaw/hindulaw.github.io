  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When male essence exceeds, the offspring is male; when female essence exceeds, the offspring is female. When both essences are equal or depleted, the result is indeterminate or contrary.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the causal dominance of embodied essence",
    "Causation is determined by the preponderance of contributory elements",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in the integrity of biological participation",
    "Restoration logic aligns with natural sequential manifestation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of causal completeness"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF male genetic contribution > female genetic contribution THEN offspring = male",
    "IF female genetic contribution > male genetic contribution THEN offspring = female",
    "IF male AND female contributions are equal OR diminished THEN outcome = indeterminate OR variant",
    "RESULTANT identity MUST reflect dominant causal essence without punitive assignment",
    "BIOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION determines jurisdictional lineage, NOT social attribution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters of inheritance, parentage, or caste determination based on birth, the court shall recognize that biological causality—determined by the dominance of seminal essence—establishes ontological precedence. Where essences are balanced or compromised, indeterminacy prevails and must be respected as a natural state, not corrected through punitive or coercive legal framing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from the proportion of seminal essence. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests accordingly. Responsibility is neither assigned nor punished but acknowledged as a function of biological capacity. There is no moral fault, only causal sequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Acknowledge biological causality without assigning blame",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Parents accept outcome as reflection of natural law",
    "Capacity Restoration: Ensure medical and societal support for indeterminate cases",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Society recognizes all manifestations as expressions of dharma-sankalpa"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source. Dharma is restored through recognition of causal essence. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
