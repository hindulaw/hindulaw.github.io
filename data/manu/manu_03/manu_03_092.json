  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must systematically and gradually disperse the remnants of those who have fallen from Dharma, including outcasts, sinners, the diseased, aged beings, and worms, upon the earth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not social status",
    "Causation is determined by spiritual degradation, not physical action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes caretaking of all life forms in alignment with cosmic order",
    "Restoration logic requires removal of impurities that obstruct universal harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment demands purification of environments to elevate collective awareness"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits signs of spiritual degradation AND disrupts environmental harmony THEN initiate gradual dispersal protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold for recognizing spiritual contamination as a legal concern requiring judicial response. The court's authority derives from its capacity to restore dharmic balance, not merely enforce punitive measures. Cases involving public health crises, societal decay, or ecological collapse invoke this principle where the state assumes responsibility for purification and reintegration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This directive operates through pramāṇa-based recognition of causal impurity disrupting natural order. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation of imbalance necessitating proportional cleansing without punitive intent. Responsibility lies with the governing body to maintain purity, not inflict suffering. The process realigns consciousness toward sattva while removing obstacles to universal well-being.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sequential environmental purification programs targeting areas of spiritual degradation",
    "Assign trained caretakers to manage disposal of contaminated materials with minimal harm to surrounding ecosystems",

    "Establish ongoing monitoring systems to detect early signs of dharmic disorder before escalation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through conscious purification. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as the ultimate adjudicator."
