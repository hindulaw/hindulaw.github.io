  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who knows Dharma does not examine a Brahmin in divine action; but when engaged in ancestral duty, one should examine with effort.",

    "Authority is context-dependent and varies by domain of action",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that divine actions performed by spiritually authorized individuals are beyond judicial inquiry unless proven to breach ancestral or societal dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies in distinguishing between realms of action, with divine acts presumed aligned with cosmic order unless direct evidence of societal harm arises.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality distinguishes divine from ancestral acts. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that divine acts unfold from higher consciousness and require no punitive correction. Proportional responsibility applies only where societal disruption occurs.
