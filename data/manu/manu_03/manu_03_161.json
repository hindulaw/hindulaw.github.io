  "transliteration": "bhrāmarī gaṇḍamālī ca śvistryatho piśunastathā |\numatto'ndhaśca varjyāḥ syur vedanindaka eva ca || 3.161||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who defame the Vedas, along with those afflicted by leprosy, chronic skin conditions, insanity, blindness, or slanderers—these are to be excluded from participation in sacred rites and societal integration until completion of restorative alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Only those aligned with Vedic consciousness may participate in dharma-based society.",
    "Causation: Exclusion arises not as punishment but due to misalignment with foundational ontological order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Individuals lacking perceptual, mental, or ethical capacity must undergo restoration prior to reintegration.",
    "Restoration logic: Rejection serves the purpose of enabling purification and realignment, not rejection itself.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Participation in dharmic life requires harmonization with cosmic intelligence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person publicly denigrates Vedic knowledge THEN exclude from all ritual and civic participation UNTIL completion of consciousness-restoration protocol.",
    "IF a person exhibits chronic physical or mental disarray THEN assess capacity for dharmic engagement AND initiate restoration process BEFORE reintegration.",
    "IF an individual engages in habitual defamation THEN isolate from community discourse UNTIL integrity-reclamation sequence is complete.",
    "IF sensory or cognitive impairment prevents accurate perception THEN defer societal role UNTIL functional capacity is restored through dharmic means."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that exclusion from societal roles must be based on demonstrable incapacity or conscious violation of Vedic alignment. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness and capacity; absence of either necessitates restoration, not condemnation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that misalignment manifests as exclusion—not imposed by external force but revealed through natural consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how deviation leads sequentially to disconnection. Proportional responsibility aligns with current state of consciousness. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that exclusion is diagnostic, not punitive.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification and healing protocols for individuals with chronic ailments to restore physical and spiritual balance.",
    "Conduct consciousness-realization sessions for those engaging in defamation or slander to reclaim integrity.",
    "Provide sensory or cognitive rehabilitation for those impaired, ensuring capacity is restored before resuming social duties.",
    "Enforce isolation from sacred spaces only long enough to complete internal realignment, followed by ceremonial reintegration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through alignment with Vedic consciousness. Reality operates without punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
