  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The grandfather, or the executor of the śrāddha ritual, shall partake of it, declared Manu; or, having been authorized, one may perform it oneself.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through lineage and conscious designation",
    "Responsibility arises from capacity to execute dharma",
    "Restoration occurs when action aligns with designated role",
    "Consciousness alignment is secured by rightful participation",
    "Causation is established through intentional authorization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ritual act requires execution AND an authorized individual exists THEN that individual must perform the act OR delegate knowingly",
    "IF no designated executor is present THEN self-execution is valid upon conscious consent",
    "IF an act is performed without authorization BUT later ratified THEN the act is restored retroactively",
    "IF dharma is obstructed due to lack of clarity in roles THEN reassignment must occur based on capacity and lineage",
    "IF consciousness alignment is disrupted THEN restoration protocols activate via completion and reintegration"

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through lineage, consent, and conscious enactment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of duty. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and authorization. No punitive consequence arises from misalignment—only restoration through re-performance under correct designation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform the śrāddha with proper designation",
    "Authorization Verification: Confirm conscious delegation or self-election",
    "Lineage Reconnection: Realign participant with ancestral dharmic flow",
