  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who die without sacraments and those who abandon family women—their remnants are to be scattered upon grasses; such is the ordinance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not social status or birth",
    "Causation follows karmic integrity and conscious completion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes post-death spiritual obligations",
    "Restoration logic requires purification of unresolved energetic imprints",
    "Consciousness alignment demands removal of disturbances caused by incomplete transitions"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual dies without undergoing samskaras AND has abandoned familial duties THEN their physical remains SHALL BE dispersed in accordance with dharmic protocols",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving deceased persons whose conduct violated core dharmic tenets—particularly regarding family abandonment or neglect of sacramental obligations—the court must defer to prescribed Vedic protocols for body disposal. These directives supersede civil preferences and reflect ontological necessity for cosmic order maintenance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper transition creates disorder requiring rectification through ritual dissolution.
