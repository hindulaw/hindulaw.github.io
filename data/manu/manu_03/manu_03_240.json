  "transliteration": "home pradāne bhojye ca yadebhirabhivīkṣyate |\ndaive haviṣi pitrye vā tadgacchatyayathātatham || 3.240||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is offered in sacrifice, given as gift, or consumed as food — when seen with divine vision in offerings to deities or ancestors — accordingly proceeds to its destined state without deviation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the consciousness of the observer and performer of ritual acts",
    "Causation flows through intent and consecration, not material substance alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in the purity and clarity of perception during offering",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with cosmic order via precise ritual execution",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the efficacy and destination of all offerings"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering_type IN {homa, dana, bhakshana} AND observer_intent IS purified THEN transfer_efficacy = TRUE",
    "IF offering_destination IN {deva, pitri} AND consecration_validity = TRUE THEN outcome_accuracy = deterministic",
    "IF sensory_perception_mode = 'divya_drishti' THEN action_consequence_mapping = direct",
    "IF ritual_integrity = maintained AND consciousness_state = aligned THEN karmic_resolution = assured"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving religious offerings or spiritual transactions, the threshold of responsibility rests on the performer's capacity for divya drishti (divine vision). The court must assess not external compliance but internal alignment. Authority flows from consciousness calibration, not institutional certification.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that offerings move according to the seer’s vision. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation based on perception quality. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of consciousness engaged. Non-punitive reality rule affirms outcomes arise naturally from perceptual integrity, not imposed judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: Realign observer consciousness to restore accurate transaction flow",
    "Assume responsibility protocol: Offerer must re-perform with corrected awareness if misperceived",
    "Restore capacity mechanism: Engage purification practices to recalibrate sensory instruments",
    "Integrate integrity sequence: Confirm alignment between intention, offering, and reception"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law executes pure Dharma. Reality responds to consciousness, not punishment. Justice restores alignment. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
