  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The monthly Śrāddha for ancestors is to be performed by those who know; it must be conducted with pure intent, careful effort, and appropriate offerings.",

    "Authority flows from conscious alignment with ancestral lineage",
    "Causation arises through sustained ritual integrity and devotional discipline",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires knowledge, purity, and intentional action",
    "Restoration logic operates via consecrated repetition and spiritual maintenance",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when duties are executed in accordance with dharma-prescribed form"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent has capacity AND knowledge of Śrāddha procedure THEN duty to perform monthly Śrāddha is activated",
    "IF Śrāddha offering lacks purity OR proper intent THEN completion process initiates correction protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning familial and ancestral obligations, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated capacity and awareness.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Śrāddha maintains causal flow between generations. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that neglect disrupts spiritual nourishment cycles.
