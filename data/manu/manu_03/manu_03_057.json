  "sanskrit_verse": "शोचन्ति जामयो यत्र विनश्यत्याशु तत्कुलम् ।\nन शोचन्ति तु यत्रैता वर्धते तधि सर्वदा ॥ ३.५७॥",
  "transliteration": "śocanti jāmayo yatra vinaśyaty āśu tatkulam |\nna śocanti tu yatraitā vardhate tadhi sarvadā || 3.57||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Wherever women mourn due to oppression, that lineage perishes swiftly; wherever they are honored and protected, that family thrives continually.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from the protection of consciousness embodied in women.",
    "Causation follows the energetic alignment of societal integrity with feminine dignity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes ensuring environments where consciousness flourishes without fear.",
    "Restoration logic demands immediate rectification of conditions causing distress to women.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring the foundational role of women in sustaining dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a household reports repeated violations against a woman's autonomy THEN initiate mandatory capacity-building protocols for all adult males within the household.",
    "IF a community fails to prevent systemic harm towards women THEN reallocate administrative oversight until protective equilibrium is restored.",
    "IF evidence shows declining well-being among women in any region THEN trigger automatic review of governance structures at local levels.",
    "IF lineage records indicate persistent neglect toward female members THEN enforce completion processes requiring public restitution before societal reintegration."

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes prima facie jurisdiction over any case involving degradation or marginalization of women as inherently violating constitutional order. The threshold of responsibility extends beyond individual actors to include institutional failures. Authority lies in restoring balance through conscious re-alignment rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that social causality flows directly from how women are treated. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates that when their suffering is ignored, decay manifests first in familial lines, then broader society. Proportional responsibility rests on those capable of altering harmful patterns. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering cannot be used as deterrent—only conscious correction restores lawful harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein offending parties publicly acknowledge root causes and commit to sustained behavioral transformation.",
    "Assign guardianship roles to elder women who oversee integration of corrected behaviors into daily life.",

    "Establish ritualized reintegration ceremonies once full alignment has been verified by affected individuals."

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma prevails where women are safeguarded, justice operates through consciousness elevation, and reality remains free from punitive distortion. All adjudication aligns with the eternal truth that awareness—not coercion—is the ultimate judge."
