  "sanskrit_verse": "अहुतं च हुतं चैव तथा प्रहुतमेव च । ब्राह्म्यं हुतं प्राशितं च पञ्चयज्ञान् प्रचक्षते ॥ ३.७३॥",
  "transliteration": "ahutaṃ ca hutaṃ caiva tathā prahutameva ca | brāhmyaṃ hutaṃ prāśitaṃ ca pañcayajñān pracakṣate || 3.73||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is unoffered, that which is offered, that which is repeatedly offered, that which is offered through Brahmanic knowledge, and that which is consumed — these together constitute the fivefold sacrifice.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious participation in cosmic order",
    "Causation arises through alignment with sacrificial completeness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by one's integration into dharma-sacrifice",
    "Restoration occurs through re-entry into the cycle of dharmic offering",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests when action reflects Vedic continuity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual performs no ritual or social duty, THEN assign completion process for foundational yajña participation.",
    "IF a person offers ritual service intermittently, THEN initiate protocol for sustained sacrificial engagement.",
    "IF knowledge of Brahmanic duty exists but is not enacted, THEN trigger capacity-realization module for scriptural embodiment.",
    "IF consumption without offering is detected, THEN activate reintegration sequence into reciprocal dharmic economy.",
    "IF all five yajñas are neglected, THEN execute full restoration pathway to Vedic societal function."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving civic or spiritual neglect, the Supreme Court shall assess whether the accused has fulfilled their share in the fivefold sacrifice. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by punitive frameworks but by measuring disconnection from dharmic reciprocity. Reintegration precedes judgment; authority derives from alignment with Vedic completeness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through dharmic omission rather than moral fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how withdrawal from sacrificial rhythm leads to disorder. Responsibility is proportional to one’s awareness of and capacity for yajña. The non-punitive reality rule ensures correction restores connection, not inflicts consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided re-engagement with daily household sacrifices (pañcamahāyajña)",
    "Assign mentorship under qualified guru for scriptural understanding and performance",
    "Implement structured community service aligned with Vedic duties",
    "Facilitate purification rituals to restore energetic alignment with sacrificial flow",
    "Establish periodic review cycles to ensure sustained dharmic participation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands as source-authority. Dharma is restored through conscious reintegration into the fivefold sacrifice. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
