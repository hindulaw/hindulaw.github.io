  "sanskrit_verse": "पाणिभ्यां तूपसङ्गृह्य स्वयमन्नस्य वर्धितम् । वर्द्धितम् विप्रान्तिके पितॄन् ध्यायन् शनकैरुपनिक्षिपेत् ॥ ३.२२४॥",
  "transliteration": "pāṇibhyāṁ tūpasasaṅgṛhya svayamannasya vardhitam | vardhitam viprāntike pitṝn dhyāyan śanakairupanikṣipet || 3.224 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has increased in prosperity through their own effort shall offer a portion of that increase gradually to the twice-born and ancestors while maintaining remembrance of them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious alignment with ancestral lineage",
    "Causation is rooted in personal effort and energetic inheritance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility expands proportionally with individual gain",
    "Restoration logic demands redistribution as completion, not charity",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through sustained ritual acknowledgment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent's wealth increases due to self-effort THEN allocate incremental portion to designated spiritual and ancestral recipients",
    "IF allocation is deferred beyond seasonal cycle THEN initiate automatic redistribution via institutional intermediaries",
    "IF recipient category includes 'twice-born' or 'ancestors' THEN ensure offerings maintain continuity of dharmic lineage flow",
    "IF offering intent diminishes THEN activate consciousness-realignment protocol through guided reflection sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning economic growth-derived obligations, the threshold of responsibility lies at the point where individual capacity exceeds subsistence. The court must recognize the inherent duty to redistribute surplus as a constitutional-level obligation derived from Varnashrama Dharma. Authority flows from alignment with cosmic order, not state mandate.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that material increase carries anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential manifestation of causal debt owed to sustaining forces. Responsibility aligns with the proportional receipt of abundance. There is no punitive consequence for neglect; rather, the natural imbalance manifests as diminished prosperity until alignment is restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate gradual reallocation cycles tied to seasonal rhythms",
    "Establish reflective practices linking material success to ancestral continuity",
    "Deploy community facilitators to guide integration of giving protocols",
    "Reconnect individual prosperity patterns with collective dharmic circulation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Dharma stands reaffirmed. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as the ultimate adjudicator."
