  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The outcaste, the pig, the chicken, the dog, the menstruating woman, and the eunuch—all these, by their very presence, disrupt the ritual purity required for the twice-born to consume food.",

    "Authority is derived from inherent spiritual capacity, not social position",
    "Causation arises from vibrational disruption, not moral fault",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's alignment with Vedic consciousness",

Responsibility is assigned based on capacity to maintain purity, not inherited status. Restoration occurs through purification protocols, not punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ritual contamination is a matter of energetic misalignment, not ethical failure. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that disruption follows naturally from incompatible states. Responsibility lies in restoring congruence. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that exclusion serves completion, not condemnation.",

This law restores balance through consciousness alignment, excludes punitive framing, and upholds the supremacy of awareness over form. Dharma is fulfilled. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
