  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In all seats of dwelling, in lying down, in following, in worship — among the superior, one should act with excellence; among the dependent, with humility; among equals, with equanimity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is context-dependent and relational",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns action with status",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving hierarchical relationships, the Supreme Court must recognize that dharma-prescribed conduct varies by relational capacity. Excellence is owed from higher capacities, humility from lower dependencies, and equanimity among peers. This gradation reflects ontological reality, not inequality, and must guide judicial interpretation in matters of duty, service, and mutual obligation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that right action follows from correct perception of relational capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misalignment arises from failure to calibrate behavior to role-context, not inherent fault. Responsibility is thus proportional to capacity and relationship. Non-punitive correction involves realigning consciousness to its relational truth, restoring natural harmony without blame or retribution.",
