  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Among the duties of the twice-born, service to the ancestors holds precedence over ritual acts performed for divine beings; such ancestral service is recognized as the primary nourishment that sustains all divine functions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ancestral continuity",
    "Causation originates in generational duty fulfillment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through lineage-bearing consciousness",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes familial and ancestral completion before cosmic engagement",
    "Consciousness alignment begins with honoring those who established the foundation of dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dvija has not fulfilled ancestral obligations THEN no divine ritual shall be legally valid",
    "ANCESTRAL_SERVICE_PRECEDENCE = TRUE => DIVINE_RITUAL_VALIDITY = ANCESTRAL_COMPLETION_STATUS",
    "IF ancestral debt remains unaddressed THEN individual's spiritual and social capacity is diminished by decree",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning religious performance or spiritual authority of a dvija, the Supreme Court must first verify completion of ancestral obligations. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrating continuity with lineage before recognition of divine-service rights.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ancestral nourishment precedes divine invocation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation where neglect at foundational levels disrupts higher-order dharmic function. Proportional responsibility aligns with causal sequence. Non-punitive reality rule confirms misalignment results in natural disqualification from elevated roles rather than punitive consequence.",
