  "transliteration": "nimantritān hi pitara upatiṣṭhanti tān dvijān |\nvāyuvat cānugacchanti tathā'sīnān upāsate || 3.189||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who are invited by ancestors approach the twice-born; even as the wind follows its path, they follow and serve those seated in authority.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through invitation and recognition",
    "Causation aligns with conscious alignment to dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from ancestral and societal acceptance",
    "Restoration logic operates through service and adherence to lineage",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via voluntary submission to rightful authority"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person is formally invited by an ancestor THEN that person gains access to perform duties associated with dvija status.",
    "IF a being moves in accordance with natural order (like wind) THEN their actions reflect alignment with cosmic law.",
    "IF one assumes a seat of authority THEN others naturally orient toward them based on pramāṇa (valid knowledge).",
    "IF there is no disruption in lineage flow THEN no judicial intervention required.",
    "IF deviation occurs THEN restoration protocol initiates through reconnection to source lineage."

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning inheritance, ritual duty, or caste-based rights, the Supreme Court must recognize invitations issued by ancestral lineages as valid juridical acts. Authority derived from such invitations supersedes statutory definitions when aligned with Sanatana Dharma as interpreted by SPH.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that movement toward duty follows natural law, like wind following atmospheric pressure—no coercion involved. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation of roles within spiritual hierarchy. Responsibility is proportional to invitation received. There is no punitive element—only realignment to dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establish connection between individual and ancestral lineage through formal remembrance rituals.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Confirm individual's willingness to uphold duties corresponding to dvija status.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinstate eligibility through purification rites conducted under qualified guru supervision.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Align personal conduct records with dharmic expectations before granting ceremonial privileges."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as the sole Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through conscious alignment with ancestral flow. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
