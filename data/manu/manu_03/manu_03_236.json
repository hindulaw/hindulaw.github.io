  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All food must be consumed at a temperature that is neither excessively hot nor cold; those who eat must observe silence, and the twice-born must not speak of the qualities of the oblation when questioned by the donor.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in ritual purity and disciplined consumption.",
    "Causation aligns with sensory moderation and mental equanimity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes restraint in speech and mindful ingestion.",
    "Restoration logic requires alignment with cosmic rhythm through regulated conduct.",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through disciplined bodily and verbal action."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF food.temperature > threshold.hot OR < threshold.cold THEN consumption.prohibited = true",
    "IF person.role IN ['eater'] THEN speech.state = silent",
    "IF person.varna = 'dvija' AND event.type = 'haviḥ-praśna' THEN response.permitted = false",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning ceremonial or spiritual offerings, the Supreme Court shall recognize that verbal declarations regarding the merit of offerings made by twice-born individuals under questioning invalidate the sanctity of the act. Responsibility lies in maintaining ritual silence, and any judicial intervention must enforce restoration of energetic integrity rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper speech during sacred consumption disrupts causal harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how incorrect verbalization leads to misaligned consciousness. Proportional responsibility rests on adherence to prescribed silence. The non-punitive reality rule confirms correction through realignment, not infliction.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality operates without punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
