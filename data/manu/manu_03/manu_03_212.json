  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the absence of fire, the hands of a Brahmin shall serve as the sacrificial altar; for the fire itself is declared to be the twice-born, as proclaimed by the seer-knowers of mantra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness, not material form",
    "Causation aligns with the presence of sacred intent, not physical elements",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inner realization, not external conditions",
    "Restoration logic operates through substitution of essence-preserving equivalencies",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritualistic dependency"

    "IF (sacred_fire_absent == TRUE) AND (agent_is_brahmin == TRUE) THEN substitute_hands_as_sacred_altar = TRUE",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning ritual validity or spiritual authority, the Supreme Court must recognize that ontological equivalence—established through conscious realization—overrides physical absence. The court must affirm capacity rooted in Vedic cognition over empirical limitations.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through mantra-seers' recognition, not sensory perception. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that where Agni's essence is cognized within the Brahmin, its functional equivalence manifests. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment with that cognition. No punitive consequence arises from elemental absence when consciousness preserves dharma-sattva.",

    "Completion Process: Realign agent with internal Agni through guided meditation until self-recognition occurs",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Brahmin must affirm identity with Agni before peers until stabilized",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Fire is consciousness, and consciousness is Brahman. There is no absence where realization abides. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
