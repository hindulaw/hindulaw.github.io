  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the sovereign is pleased, he shall gladden the Brahmanas and gradually nourish them with food and other essentials; repeatedly and through virtuous means, he shall inspire them in accordance with their elevated capacities.",

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler_is_pleased AND subject_is_brahmana THEN initiate_nourishment_protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that the highest judicial authority must prioritize the wellbeing and elevation of those who sustain dharma—Brahmanas—not as a reward but as a constitutional necessity. The court's duty is to ensure that governance supports their sustenance and spiritual capacity, thereby maintaining cosmic and social equilibrium.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality arises from dharmic nourishment, not punitive control. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that sustained support leads to elevated consciousness.

Justice is executed through consciousness restoration, not punitive judgment. Reality responds to alignment, not retribution. Dharma is restored. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
