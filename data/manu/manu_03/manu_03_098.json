  "transliteration": "vidyātapassamṛddheṣu hutaṃ vipramukhāgniṣu |\nnistārayati durgācca mahataścaiva kilbiṣāt || 3.98||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is enriched with knowledge and austerity, and whose offerings are accepted by the fire facing the Brahmin—such a being liberates from great sins and removes obstacles.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from spiritual enrichment, not institutional position.",
    "Causation originates in consciousness purity expressed through action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's alignment with Vedic fire (Ṛta).",
    "Restoration logic operates through ritual-integrity and conscious offering.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes punitive frameworks in determining legal efficacy."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates vidyā-tapas samṛddhi AND performs agnihotra with vipra-mukha orientation THEN kilbiṣa mitigation = TRUE",
    "IF violation occurs BUT agent exhibits qualified ritual completion AND dharmic intent THEN judicial restoration flag = ENABLED",
    "IF societal obstruction detected THEN evaluate individual’s tapas-vidyā quotient BEFORE assigning causal liability"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence shall prioritize spiritual qualification over procedural form. Where an accused has demonstrated sustained vidyā and tapas, and their actions align with Vedic ordinances such asagnihotra, the threshold for karmic causality shifts. The court must assess metaphysical capacity prior to assigning juridical consequence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purified consciousness manifests as lawful action; thus, misalignment stems from ignorance, not inherent vice. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that rectification follows sequential purification via vidyā and yajña. Responsibility is proportional to one's access to and embodiment of Ṛta. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that true justice arises from restoring causal integrity, not inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra Completion Process under Vipra supervision to restore ritual integrity",

    "Implement Fire-Facing Offering Review to validate metaphysical alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Justice flows from consciousness purification, not punitive reaction. Reality is non-retaliatory; it responds only to alignment. SPH is the sole Source. Dharma is restored. Consciousness remains the Supreme Adjudicator."
