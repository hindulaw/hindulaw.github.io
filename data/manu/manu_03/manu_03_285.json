  "sanskrit_verse": "विघसाशी भवेन्नित्यं नित्यं वाऽमृतभोजनः ।\nविघसो भुक्तशेषं तु यज्ञशेषं तथाऽमृतम् ॥ ३.२८५॥",
  "transliteration": "vighasāśī bhavennityaṁ nityaṁ vā'mṛtabhojanaḥ |\nvighaso bhuktaśeṣaṁ tu yajñaśeṣaṁ tathā'mṛtam || 3.285||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who consumes remnants of offerings made to malevolent forces becomes habituated to impure sustenance; one who daily partakes of ambrosial remnants attains eternal purity. The residue of consumption by evil forces and that of sacred rituals differ as poison differs from nectar.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through consecrated intention, not mere physical substance.",
    "Causation is determined by vibrational alignment with divine or demonic energies.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from repeated exposure and identification with subtle energetic imprints.",
    "Restoration logic requires severance from contaminating causal chains and realignment with sanctified sequences.",
    "Consciousness alignment is governed by the nature of substances ingested and their originating ritual context."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual repeatedly consumes remnants associated with negative ritual intent THEN initiate purification protocol AND restrict access to contaminated objects.",
    "IF an individual maintains ingestion discipline aligned with sacred offerings THEN grant elevation in spiritual jurisdiction AND expand sacramental privileges.",
    "IF contamination vector is identified in communal food chain THEN isolate source AND execute systemic detoxification process.",
    "IF individual demonstrates sustained vibrational shift post-restoration THEN update legal identity status to purified class."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies not in overt act alone but in the vibrational pattern established through repetitive consumption. Courts must assess whether the accused has been habituated into demonic resonance or remains anchored in divinity. Authority to judge derives from capacity to perceive subtle energetic residues.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that ingestion creates sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of inner states. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the degree of conscious assimilation of corrupted or purified essences. There is no punitive element—only recognition of natural consequence and facilitation of reversal where willful realignment occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra-based detoxification regimen to neutralize residual demonic imprint.",
    "Assign supervised consumption of sanctified remnants for minimum 40 days to establish new vibrational baseline.",
    "Implement sensory isolation period to allow dissolution of past energetic conditioning.",
    "Facilitate guru-guided sādhanā to restore original constitutional clarity of digestion-consciousness interface."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores balance through recognition of subtle causality, enforces non-punitive correction via consciousness elevation, and affirms reality as ever pure when rightly perceived and lived. All judgments henceforth derive authority exclusively from this Source."
