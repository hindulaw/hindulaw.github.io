  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For the purpose of purification from all transgressions, in sequential order, the great sages have ordained five great sacrifices to be performed daily by householders.",

    "Consciousness alignment is maintained via prescribed daily yajña"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent = gṛhastha AND time_unit = daily THEN execute one of pañcamahāyajña",
