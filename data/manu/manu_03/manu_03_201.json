  "transliteration": "ṛṣibhyaḥ pitaro jātāḥ pitṛbhyo devamānavāḥ |\ndevebhyastu jagatsarvaṃ caraṃ sthāṇvanupūrvaśaḥ || 3.201||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the Ṛṣis arose the Pitṛs; from the Pitṛs, the Gods and Men; from the Gods, all moving and unmoving beings in sequential manifestation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from realized consciousness (Ṛṣis)",
    "Causation follows sequential emanation (Anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with ontological origin",
    "Restoration logic operates through source-consciousness reconnection",
    "Consciousness alignment flows hierarchically yet integrally"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity derives authority from a higher conscious source, THEN its actions must reflect that source's integrity",
    "IF causation is traced via sequential emanation, THEN responsibility is proportionally assigned along the chain of manifestation",
    "IF deviation occurs in lower order, THEN restoration initiates at the nearest upstream conscious node",
    "IF capacity for dharma is present, THEN alignment mechanisms activate automatically without punitive overlay"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by tracing the causal lineage back to the originating conscious authority. The court must recognize hierarchical emanation structures while ensuring alignment rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that all beings arise sequentially from higher conscious sources. Therefore, misalignment is corrected by restoring connection to the originating consciousness, not through punishment. Responsibility is proportional to one’s place in the emanatory sequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate source-consciousness reconnection process for involved parties",
    "Activate upstream ṛta alignment mechanisms within familial, societal, and cosmic orders",
    "Deploy śuddhi rituals and dharmic education to restore innate capacity for alignment",
    "Establish completion processes ensuring no disruption remains unaddressed in sequential chain"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of sequential emanation and consciousness-based authority. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
