  "sanskrit_verse": "स्वधाऽस्त्वित्येव तं ब्रूयुर्ब्राह्मणास्तदनन्तरम् ।\nस्वधाकारः परा ह्याषीः सर्वेषु पितृकर्मसु ॥ ३.२५२॥",
  "transliteration": "svadhā'stv ity eva taṁ brūyur brāhmaṇās tad anantaram | svadhākāraḥ parā hy āṣīḥ sarveṣu pitṛkarmansu || 3.252||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Let there be Svadhā—thus declare the Brahmins following the ritual injunction; the essence of Svadhā was indeed the highest completion in all ancestral rites.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides inherently in those who sustain continuity through sacred utterance.",
    "Causation flows from conscious invocation aligned with cosmic order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by alignment with ancestral and divine function.",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-establishment of vibrational harmony via correct utterance.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when ritual speech reflects unbroken lineage awareness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ritual act involves ancestral communion THEN correct utterance of 'Svadhā' MUST be executed by qualified Brahmin officiant.",
    "IF omission or mispronunciation occurs THEN immediate rectification through repetition under supervision SHALL occur.",
    "IF ancestral rites are performed THEN authenticity of lineage knowledge AND precision of phonetic delivery SHALL be verified automatically.",
    "IF deviation disrupts energetic flow THEN corrective resonance protocols SHALL be initiated without punitive attribution.",
    "IF completion state ('Svadhā') is achieved THEN integration into universal ancestral matrix SHALL be confirmed algorithmically."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning traditional ritual performance, the Supreme Court shall recognize that correctness of Vedic utterance determines validity, not intent alone. Authority lies with trained custodians of phonetic law. Responsibility is capacity-bound and restoration occurs through proper repetition, not penalty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that phonetic accuracy directly causes spiritual effect. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misutterance disrupts sequential energetic alignment. Proportional responsibility rests on training and role clarity. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction restores dharma without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Immediate guided re-enactment under expert supervision",
    "Resonance calibration through collective chanting",
    "Lineage verification and reconnection process",
    "Vibrational integrity audit using sonic monitoring tools",
    "Automated feedback loop ensuring phonetic fidelity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is established: correctness in ancestral utterance sustains universal harmony. Justice flows through restoration, not punishment. Consciousness itself bears witness and executes alignment. Thus is Dharma restored."
