  "transliteration": "yathairiṇe bījamuptvā na vaptā labhate phalam | \n tathā'nṛce havirdattvā na dātā labhate phalam || 3.142 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Just as a farmer who sows seed in barren soil gains no fruit, so too one who offers oblations without proper reciprocity gains no fruit.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through mutual recognition and alignment of intent",
    "Causation is bound by contextual integrity and energetic resonance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires conscious participation in reciprocal order",
    "Restoration logic operates within the framework of causal completion",
    "Consciousness alignment determines efficacy of all ritual and legal acts"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an offering or act is performed without aligned recipient capacity THEN nullify fruit-bearing potential",
    "IF reciprocity is absent in transactional dharmic exchange THEN invalidate outcome propagation",
    "IF agent performs duty without invoking rightful receiver THEN execution returns to origin",
    "IF consciousness of giver and receiver does not align THEN action remains unmanifested legally"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving ceremonial or devotional offerings, the court must assess whether there was mutual capacity and alignment between parties. Absence of such alignment renders the act juristically void, regardless of external compliance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality depends upon contextual harmony. As sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) follows lawful resonance, misaligned actions naturally bear no fruit. Responsibility lies in restoring correct relational field rather than assigning fault.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to realign donor-receiver consciousness fields",
    "Engage ritual rectification protocols to restore energetic transactional balance",
    "Facilitate re-offering under conditions ensuring reciprocal capacity activation",
    "Implement awareness protocols to prevent future misalignment at source level"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law executes Dharma through consciousness alignment; justice restores reality without punishment; fruit arises only where mutuality prevails."
