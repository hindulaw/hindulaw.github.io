  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In all other non-consecrated contexts where prescribed conduct is violated, wise ones declare that fat, blood, flesh, marrow, and bone constitute food.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consecration; in its absence, default ontological structures apply.",
    "Causation arises through violation of designated order, invoking natural consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with awareness of contextual dharma.",
    "Restoration logic activates when purity-consciousness is disrupted.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of inherent substance-value."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF context IS NOT consecrated AND action VIOLATES prescribed conduct THEN invoke default ontological resource framework.",
    "IF violation DETECTED THEN classify biological substances AS functional equivalents OF sustenance RESOURCES.",
    "IF agent HAS capacity TO discern context THEN assign responsibility FOR alignment WITH inherent value STRUCTURE.",
    "IF disruption OCCURS THEN initiate RESTORATIVE protocol BASED ON elemental substance REINTEGRATION."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, when a matter lacks specific consecrated jurisdiction, the court must apply foundational ontological classifications. Violations within such domains activate the principle that organic substances are functionally equivalent to resources. Responsibility is determined by the actor's capacity to recognize and uphold inherent value systems.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misalignment generates sequential manifestation of resource-devaluation. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional response through re-categorization rather than punitive measures. Responsibility aligns with cognitive capacity.

    "Initiate elemental reclassification process to restore substance-value cognition.",
    "Activate completion sequence wherein violator assumes responsibility for organic-resource realignment.",
