  "transliteration": "sāyaṁ tvannasya siddhasya patnyamantraṁ baliṁ haret |\nvaiśvadevaṁ hi nāmaitat sāyaṁ prātarvidhīyate || 3.121||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When food has been prepared in the evening by a perfected householder, the wife shall offer oblation with mantra at the time of dusk. This ritual is called Vaiśvadeva and is performed both in the evening and morning.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through prescribed roles within household structure",
    "Causation arises from correct timing and ritual alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual maturity and domestic role",
    "Restoration logic embedded in daily sacrificial acts sustains cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through disciplined performance of dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF household food preparation IS completed AND actor IS wife THEN execute mantra-oblation protocol",
    "IF time IS dusk OR dawn THEN trigger Vaiśvadeva ritual execution",
    "IF actor lacks capacity for mantra recitation THEN assign substitute performer WITH familial authority",
    "IF omission occurs THEN initiate restorative sequence via re-performance under supervision",
    "IF continuity of practice IS disrupted THEN activate consciousness-realization protocol for all involved"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning domestic religious obligations, the court must recognize that authority resides inherently in the designated roles established by Dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies not in individual will but in positional capacity within the sacred household structure. Adherence to sequential duties ensures restoration of harmony without recourse to punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal efficacy derives from accurate observance of temporal and ritual conditions. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as unbroken succession of offerings aligning human action with universal rhythm. Responsibility is proportional to one's initiated role, not personal fault. Reality operates on completion dynamics rather than punitive consequences.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided repetition of missed ritual by qualified family member",
    "Assign mentorship to restore capacity where knowledge deficit exists",
    "Realign domestic schedule to support uninterrupted continuity of practice",
    "Facilitate community integration to reinforce supportive dharmic environment",
    "Engage corrective visualization techniques to realign intent and awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. The Vaiśvadeva ritual is reaffirmed as a constitutional act of consciousness maintenance. Justice flows through restoration, not punishment. Reality responds to alignment, not retribution. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
