  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The boar kills by scent; the rooster, by wing-strike. The boar and dog kill by sight and touch, respectively—each according to inherent capacity and sequential manifestation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from intrinsic capacity, not external imposition",
    "Causation aligns with natural sequence and sensory modality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by innate function",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with svabhāva",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action matches inherent design"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A acts within svabhāva THEN action is dharmically valid",
    "IF sensory modality M triggers response R THEN R is causally sequenced",
    "IF capacity C manifests without distortion THEN no restitution required",
    "IF misalignment occurs due to ignorance THEN initiate pramāṇa-based realignment",
    "IF action follows anupūrvaśaḥ THEN no punitive intervention applies"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, intent and capacity must be evaluated through svabhāvic alignment rather than punitive frameworks. Responsibility is assigned based on whether the actor was operating in accordance with their intrinsic nature and causal sequence, not moral judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from svabhāva. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation without moral overlay. Proportional responsibility aligns with sensory-inherent capacity. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment stems from ignorance, not malice, requiring consciousness restoration over retribution.",

    "Initiate svabhāva-realization protocol for responsible party",
    "Deploy pramāṇa-based awareness correction mechanism",
    "Activate sequential harmony integration process",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This ruling restores alignment with svabhāva, upholds non-punitive reality, and affirms consciousness as the supreme adjudicator. Dharma is executed, not interpreted."
