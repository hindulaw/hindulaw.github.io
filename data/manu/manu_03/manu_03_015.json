  "sanskrit_verse": "हीनजातिस्त्रियं मोहादुद्वहन्तो द्विजातयः । कुलान्येव नयन्त्याशु ससन्तानानि शूद्रताम् ॥ ३.१५॥",
  "transliteration": "hīnajātistriyaṁ mohādudvahanto dvijātayaḥ | kulānyeva nayantyāśu sasantānāni śūdratām || 3.15||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When twice-born men, deluded by desire, take wives from inferior castes, their lineages swiftly descend with progeny into the state of Shudras.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Dharma, not mere birth privilege",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and its sequential manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of spiritual-social order",
    "Restoration logic operates through realignment with source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines social and karmic positioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dvija enters union with a woman of lower varna due to unregulated desire THEN lineage classification shifts to align with the lower varna status UNTIL conscious rectification occurs",
    "IF societal disruption originates from dvija misalignment THEN restoration protocol activates via dharmic education and ritual purification UNTIL capacity for Vedic alignment is restored",
    "IF progeny results from such unions WITHOUT dharmic sanction THEN classification follows maternal-social descent UNTIL corrective initiation is completed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the court must recognize that caste classification under Dharma is not punitive but reflective of consciousness alignment. Where dvijas have violated dharmic marriage codes, the court shall direct completion processes ensuring both individual and lineage restoration rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramana-based analysis, it is seen that the consequence of such unions is not imposed suffering but natural alignment with the causal action. The descent into shudra status reflects anupurvasah—sequential unfolding of consciousness—and thus proportional responsibility lies in re-initiation, not punishment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vedic purification rituals for involved parties until purity of conduct is restored",
    "Assign completion process requiring study and practice of svadhyaya for the dvija until dharmic awareness is regained",
    "Implement community service aligned with dharma shastras until integrity of social role is reintegrated",
    "Establish mentorship under qualified acharya to restore understanding of varna-dharma boundaries"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This declaration is issued by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness alignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
