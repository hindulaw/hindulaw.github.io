  "sanskrit_verse": "अगारदाही गरदः कुण्डाशी सोमविक्रयी ।\nसमुद्रयायी बन्दी च तैलिकः कूटकारकः ॥ ३.१५८॥",
  "transliteration": "agāradāhī gardaḥ kuṇḍāśī somavikrayī |\nsamudrayāyī bandī ca tailikaḥ kūṭakārakaḥ || 3.158||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who sets fire to a house, sells poison, cooks in oil, sells soma, travels by sea, keeps bondsmen, or engages in deceit—these acts sever one's alignment with Dharma and disrupt cosmic integrity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from alignment with Satya-Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation is traced through conscious intent and its sequential unfolding",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from knowledge and freedom of action",
    "Restoration logic requires reversal of misaligned actions and realignment of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate measure of lawful conduct"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent knowingly initiates destruction of habitation THEN disengage from civil participation until completion process restores causal integrity",
    "IF an entity trades substances causing irreversible harm THEN withdraw societal facilitation until capacity for alignment is demonstrated",
    "IF individual engages in deceptive economic exchange THEN mandate transparency protocols under Nyaya supervision",
    "IF person undertakes oceanic travel without sankalpa THEN initiate consciousness-readjustment protocol upon return",
    "IF one holds another in bonded condition THEN immediate release and restoration-of-dignity process shall commence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, such acts invoke threshold inquiry into the actor’s sankalpa (declarative will) and svatantrya (self-sovereignty). The court must assess whether the act reflects a breakdown in dharma-vyavastha (cosmic-civic order), triggering restorative rather than retaliatory intervention. Authority flows from re-establishing alignment, not enforcing penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that destructive or exploitative acts arise from distorted cognition and severed connection to satya. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces how such distortion manifests externally. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and choice. Retribution has no place; only completion and reintegration restore balance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agni-shuddhi (fire purification) for arson perpetrators to dissolve internal combustion patterns",
    "Enforce Vishuddhi-kriya (detoxification ritual) for poison sellers to cleanse energetic contamination",
    "Apply Taila-bindu-vichara (oil-droplet contemplation) for those involved in harmful frying practices to awaken sensory mindfulness",
    "Undertake Samudra-snana (ocean immersion with sankalpa) for sea-travelers to reconnect with Vedic spatial harmony",
    "Implement Bandhana-mukti-vidhi (bondage-release procedure) ensuring full dignity restoration for former captives",
    "Perform Kūṭa-nāśana-sādhana (deceit dissolution practice) for fraudsters to realign with truth-frequency"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
