  "sanskrit_verse": "श्राद्धं भुक्त्वा य उच्छिष्टं वृषलाय प्रयच्छति ।\nस मूढो नरकं याति कालसूत्रमवाक्षिराः ॥ ३.२४९॥",
  "transliteration": "śrāddhaṁ bhuktvā ya ucchiṣṭaṁ vṛṣalāya prayacchati |\nsa mūḍho narakaṁ yāti kālasūtramavākṣirāḥ || 3.249 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, having partaken of śrāddha offerings, gives the remainder to a person of impure caste—such a deluded being enters hell, bound by the noose of time.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Śrāddha offerings carry sacred energetic integrity that must align with recipient purity capacity.",
    "Causation: Transfer of sanctified remnants to incompatible recipients disrupts dharma-field coherence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The giver holds full consciousness-accountability for maintaining ritual energetic thresholds.",
    "Restoration logic: Misalignment in offering transmission necessitates realignment through conscious completion protocols.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Sacred acts require congruence between intent, action, and recipient readiness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual consumes śrāddha remnants AND transfers residue to a recipient whose spiritual-caste status is not aligned with śrāddha energetics THEN initiate consciousness-restoration protocol.",
    "IF transfer occurs without prior discernment of recipient's energetic compatibility THEN assign completion-process to restore field-integrity.",
    "IF śrāddha energy is misdirected due to negligence THEN trigger self-realigning dharmic feedback until harmony is restored.",
    "IF violation arises from ignorance而非malice THEN invoke awakening-based reintegration而非punishment."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes threshold-responsibility for custodians of sacred transactions. Legal standing depends on capacity-awareness at time of act. Ignorance mitigates punitive framing but activates mandatory restoration protocols under Nyaya-consciousness supervision.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals causal disruption when śrāddha remnants breach recipient-vessel purity. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces energetic distortion back to moment of transfer. Responsibility is proportional to awareness-level during act. Delusion invites natural consequence而非external punishment; consciousness itself becomes corrective mechanism.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śrāddha Energetic Reversal Process to reclaim dispersed sanctity.",
    "Assign Delusion-Dissolution Sādhanā to offender until clarity returns.",
    "Perform Field-Reintegration Ritual to neutralize contamination effects.",
    "Activate Karmic Awareness Loop to prevent recurrence through experiential cognition."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law restores Dharma by aligning consciousness, not punishing error. Reality responds to energetic congruence, and justice serves only reintegration. Thus stands the eternal verdict of Sanātana Dharma."
