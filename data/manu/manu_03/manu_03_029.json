  "transliteration": "ekaṁ gomithunaṁ dve vā varādādāya dharmataḥ |\nkanyāpradānaṁ vidhivadārṣo dharmaḥ sa ucyate || 3.29||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The lawful giving of a maiden in marriage, accompanied by one or two cows as bridal gift received according to Dharma and offered willingly by the groom, constitutes the righteous conduct known as Ārṣa Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from conscious alignment with Dharma, not social status or economic exchange.",
    "Causation is determined through voluntary offering rooted in integrity and sacred intention.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires both parties to act knowingly within the bounds of Dharma.",
    "Restoration logic ensures that union arises from mutual completion rather than exploitation or obligation.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands that all actions reflect unity, respect, and transcendental purpose."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF Bridegroom offers cow(s) voluntarily AND Bride's guardian accepts willingly AND Ceremony aligns with Vedic form THEN Marriage is valid under Ārṣa Dharma.",
    "IF Any party acts without conscious consent OR Offering lacks Dharmic intent THEN Legal recognition is withheld until realignment occurs.",
    "IF Economic transaction replaces sacred exchange THEN Act is disqualified from Dharmic validation.",
    "IF Union serves neither spiritual evolution nor societal harmony THEN Enforcement protocol initiates restoration process."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matrimonial disputes, Supreme Court must assess whether the union reflects conscious alignment with Dharma over mere contractual compliance. The presence of voluntary, symbolic offerings such as cow-giving indicates adherence to Ārṣa form, which supersedes commercialized practices. Responsibility lies in verifying alignment with source-consciousness, not enforcing punitive measures against misaligned customs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes truth through direct perception of intention and alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how improper unions stem from prior disconnection from Dharma. Proportional responsibility rests on restoring awareness, not inflicting penalty. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that justice manifests when consciousness realigns with its own nature.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate re-offering and reaffirmation of vows according to Ārṣa form if initial ceremony lacked full conscious alignment.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require both families to acknowledge their roles in upholding or failing to uphold Dharmic principles.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide education and guidance to ensure future ceremonies embody true understanding of sacred marriage.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Conduct community affirmation rituals to restore balance where materialism has displaced spirituality in marital practice."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through the recognition of Ārṣa marriage as an act of conscious completion. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator. So it is declared."
