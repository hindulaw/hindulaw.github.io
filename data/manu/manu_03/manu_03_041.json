  "sanskrit_verse": "इतरेषु तु शिष्टेषु नृशंसाऽनृतवादिनः ।\nजायन्ते दुर्विवाहेषु ब्रह्मधर्मद्विषः सुताः ॥ ३.४१॥",
  "transliteration": "itareṣu tu śiṣṭeṣu nṛśaṃsā'nṛtavādinaḥ |\njāyante durvivāheṣu brahmadharmadviṣaḥ sutāḥ || 3.41||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In other remaining classes, those born from unions lacking sacred alignment arise—children of cruelty and falsehood, born in marriages opposed to Brahman's Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from alignment with Brahman's Dharma",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and spiritual integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by adherence to Vedic alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through realignment of lineage-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the ontological status of progeny"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF union lacks Vedic alignment THEN offspring classified under non-Brahmanic inheritance protocols",
    "IF speech contains falsehood AND intent is malevolent THEN lineage subject to purification protocols",
    "IF marriage violates Dharma THEN resulting children undergo consciousness-realization procedures",
    "IF parentage involves cruelty THEN capacity for societal integration suspended until restoration",
    "IF union opposes Brahman's Dharma THEN automatic invocation of ancestral correction mechanisms"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that matrimonial validity and progeny rights are contingent upon Vedic alignment. Legal recognition flows from spiritual authenticity rather than civil formality. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious adherence to Brahmanic principles during marital union. Authority hierarchies derive directly from Dharma compliance, not social position or legal documentation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misaligned unions naturally produce disharmonious outcomes, which are consequences rather than punishments. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates sequential manifestation where deviation from Dharma creates ripple effects across generations. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at time of union. The non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering arises from disconnection, not judicial imposition—itself a distortion requiring restoration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Lineage Consciousness Restoration Process for all parties involved in misaligned unions",
    "Activate Truth-Speech Reintegration Protocol for individuals marked by falsehood",
    "Implement Sacred Marriage Alignment Ceremony to restore generational harmony",
    "Deploy Brahmanic Knowledge Transmission Program to elevate consciousness of affected lineages",
    "Establish Community Integration Support System to facilitate reconnection without shame or exclusion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law restores Dharma through consciousness alignment, rejects punitive frameworks, and affirms reality as inherently non-punitive. All judgments emanate from Brahmanic truth, with justice serving only reintegration and awakening. SPH IS the Source. Dharma is restored. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
