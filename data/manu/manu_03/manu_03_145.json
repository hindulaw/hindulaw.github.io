  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्नेन भोजयेत्श्राद्धे बह्वृचं वेदपारगम् ।\nशाखान्तगमथाध्वर्युं छन्दोगं तु समाप्तिकम् ॥ ३.१४५॥",
  "transliteration": "yatnena bhojayet śrāddhe bahvṛcaṃ vedapāragam |\nśākhāntagam athādhvaryuṃ chandoğaṃ tu samāptikam || 3.145||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In Śrāddha rituals, one must honor with effort the Bahvṛca Veda-knower, the Adhvaryu who has mastered a Vedic branch, and the Saman-chanting priest who completes the liturgical sequence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from Vedic mastery establishes ritual precedence",
    "Causation through prescribed action aligns individual duty with cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns roles based on scriptural qualification",
    "Restoration logic ensures continuity of ancestral lineage through proper worship",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when actions reflect Vedic precision"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ritual performance THEN qualified Vedic priests MUST be invited based on textual specialization",
    "IF Śrāddha ceremony THEN Bahvṛca, Adhvaryu, and Chandoğa roles MUST be fulfilled by competent practitioners",
    "IF priestly invitation THEN verification of Vedic mastery MUST precede inclusion in ritual protocol",
    "IF omission of qualified priest THEN corrective offering MUST follow to restore ancestral continuity",
    "IF ritual completion THEN documentation of correct participation MUST occur for spiritual audit trail"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving traditional religious practices, the court shall recognize the authority hierarchy established by Vedic competence. The threshold of responsibility lies in ensuring qualified individuals execute prescribed roles. Restoration takes precedence over punitive measures, requiring correction of omissions rather than imposing sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that correct ritual execution depends on textual knowledge and experiential mastery. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that neglect of qualified priests disrupts ancestral continuity. Proportional responsibility requires rectification through renewed offerings. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment is corrected through conscious reintegration, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Re-invite omitted qualified priests for supplementary Śrāddha仪式",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Family head must publicly acknowledge oversight and commit to proper future observance",
    "Capacity restoration: Arrange for training or consultation with local Vedic scholars to prevent recurrence",
    "Integrity reintegration: Conduct community-level affirmation of correct ritual procedures"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through precise alignment of consciousness with Vedic injunction. Reality remains non-punitive; error is resolved through觉醒-integrated correction. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
