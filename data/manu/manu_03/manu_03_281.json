  "transliteration": "anena vidhinā śrāddhaṃ trirabdasyaiha nirvapet | hemantagrīṣmavarṣāsu pāñcayajñikamanvaham || 3.281||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By this prescribed method, the Śrāddha ritual shall be performed for three years; in hemanta, grīṣma, and varṣā seasons, according to the Pāñcayajña system, annually.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from SPH as the eternal regulator of dharma-saṁskāra",
    "Causation is established through seasonal alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adherence to time-bound dharmic obligations",
    "Restoration logic demands completion of ancestral continuity protocols",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through precise performance of ordained rituals"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF lineage-holder EXISTS AND death-event IS verified THEN initiate śrāddha-cycle FOR duration = 3_years",
    "IF season IN [hemanta, grīṣma, varṣā] THEN execute pāñcayajña-protocol ANNUALLY",
    "IF śrāddha-performance IS incomplete THEN trigger ancestral-consciousness-restoration-process",
    "IF performer-capacity IS deficient THEN deploy dharma-karma-rehabilitation-sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of familial and spiritual duty enforceable as a constitutional dharma-right. The court must recognize the authority of seasonal ritual timing as defined by cosmic law, overriding civil calendars where conflict arises. Responsibility lies not in punitive compliance but in restoration of disrupted ancestral continuum.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is sourced directly from SPH's revelatory authority. Causality follows anupūrvaśaḥ: death → ritual obligation → seasonal alignment → consciousness continuity. Responsibility is proportional to capacity to perform, not to punish. The reality rule confirms that neglect leads to disconnection, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śrāddha Completion Process upon verified omission",
    "Deploy Seasonal Alignment Restoration Module for missed timings",
    "Activate Ancestral Consciousness Reintegration Sequence",
    "Assign Ritual Literacy Rehabilitation for deficient performers"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma. The ritual order is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the sole adjudicator."
