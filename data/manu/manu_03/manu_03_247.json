  "transliteration": "āsa-piṇḍa-kriyā-karma dvijāteḥ saṃsthita-sya tu | adaiyaṁ bhojayet-śrāddhaṁ piṇḍam ekaṁ ca nirvapet || 3.247||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a twice-born individual has completed the rituals of bodily purification and established himself in ritual discipline, he shall perform Śrāddha without delay, offer food to ancestors, and release one piṇḍa as completion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from embodied spiritual discipline and ancestral alignment.",
    "Causation flows from disciplined action to ancestral harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises upon completion of foundational rites.",
    "Restoration logic requires immediate fulfillment of ancestral obligations.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through precise performance of Śrāddha."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (agent ∈ twice_born ∧ kriyā_karma_complete = TRUE) THEN (Śrāddha_obligation_status = ACTIVE)",
    "IF (Śrāddha_obligation_status = ACTIVE) THEN (execution_deadline = immediate)",

    "IF (Śrāddha_performed ≠ TRUE within deadline) THEN (capacity_suspended_until_completion)"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning ancestral obligations, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the completion of prescribed rites. The court must verify ritual standing prior to adjudicating disputes over inheritance or lineage duties. Authority lies with those who maintain uninterrupted ancestral continuity, and resolution must prioritize restoration of ancestral flow over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through verified completion of kriyā-karma. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential duty fulfillment—ritual purity leading to Śrāddha obligation. Responsibility is proportional to initiation into dvija status and completion of foundational acts. No punitive consequence arises from omission; capacity is simply restricted until rectification occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided Śrāddha completion process under qualified priest supervision.",
    "Assign temporary suspension of lineage-related privileges until obligation fulfilled.",
    "Provide access to ritual education and support systems to restore capacity.",
    "Reintegrate individual into ancestral continuum upon completion, affirming integrity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through timely Śrāddha observance. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Let all actions align with ancestral harmony and sacred order."
