    "Consciousness alignment occurs when respect becomes a lived practice"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes the threshold of responsibility at the level of conscious choice to honor or neglect. The hierarchy of authority rests on the innate divinity of every being. Adjudicators must assess whether the defendant has fulfilled their dharmic duty of reverence, not merely adherence to social norms. Restoration is achieved by mandating corrective rituals of honor rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality lies in the act of honoring or dishonoring, which directly impacts cosmic balance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglect leads to disorder and suffering. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and capacity. Non-punitive reality is upheld because correction involves reconnection, not infliction. Justice aligns consciousness back to its source through completion of devotional action.",

    "Implement Utsava-Vibhuti Alignment: Organize celebratory event where offender facilitates joy and recognition for others"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: This Dharma stands eternal, unmodified by time or opinion. It restores order through conscious veneration. There is no punishment, only realignment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
