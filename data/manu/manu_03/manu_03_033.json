  "sanskrit_verse": "हत्वा छित्त्वा च भित्त्वा च क्रोशन्तीं रुदतीं गृहात् ।\nप्रसह्य कन्याहरणं राक्षसो विधिरुच्यते ॥ ३.३३॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Rakshasa mode of marriage is declared as that wherein a maiden is seized by force from her home while she shrieks and weeps, after slaying, cleaving, or breaking through her protectors.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The act violates the consent and autonomy of the individual, thereby nullifying any claim to lawful union.",
    "Causation: The sequence of violence directly causes the disruption of dharma and social harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Perpetrator demonstrates incapacity for dharmic conduct due to absence of restraint and respect for sovereignty.",
    "Restoration logic: Reintegration requires acknowledgment of harm, cessation of violence, and restoration of integrity to the violated party.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True union arises only when both parties align in awakened consciousness; coercion contradicts this foundation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual seizes another against their will using physical force THEN such action constitutes violation of dharmic union law.",
    "IF shrieking or crying is observed during seizure THEN automatic suspension of claimed consent applies.",
    "IF perpetrator has caused bodily harm to guardians THEN capacity for lawful union is forfeited until completion process restores integrity.",
    "IF coercive seizure occurs THEN automated restoration protocol initiates with mandatory non-punitive completion process for perpetrator."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in establishing factual presence of force, audible distress signals, and breach of domicile. Authority hierarchy recognizes the inviolability of personal sovereignty above all claims of possession. Restoration supersedes punitive measures by mandating perpetrator undergo consciousness realignment and victim-assisted reintegration protocols before eligibility for lawful union is reconsidered.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal chain from intent to seize, through violent acts, to breakdown of societal trust. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential degradation of dharma upon execution of seizure. Proportional responsibility rests on degree of force applied and damage inflicted. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that suffering does not restore dharma; only conscious correction and energetic rebalancing do.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Seizer must engage in structured restitution program under witness until emotional and energetic equilibrium is restored.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Seizer acknowledges full agency in disruption and commits publicly to no repetition.",
    "Capacity Restoration Regimen: Mandatory spiritual discipline and behavioral recalibration enforced via certified guide until readiness verified.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Ceremony: Victim-guided ceremony conducted to affirm return of personal sovereignty and collective trust."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
