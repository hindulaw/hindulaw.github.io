  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्राह्मादिषु विवाहेषु चतुर्ष्वेवानुपूर्वशः ।\nब्रह्मवर्चस्विनः पुत्रा जायन्ते शिष्टसम्मताः ॥ ३.३९॥",
  "transliteration": "brāhmādiṣu vivāheṣu caturṣvevānupūrvaśaḥ | brahmavarcasvinaḥ putrā jāyante śiṣṭasammatāḥ || 3.39||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the first four types of marriages beginning with the Brāhma form, sons are born who possess Brahmic radiance and are recognized by the wise.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Vedic consciousness",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation rooted in dharmic intent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through lineage-conscious union",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of spiritual progeny",
    "Consciousness alignment determines social legitimacy"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF marriage type ∈ {Brāhma, Daiva, Ārsha, Prajāpatya} THEN offspring qualify as 'Brahmavarcaḥ' BY DEFAULT",
    "IF child is 'Brahmavarcaḥ' THEN societal recognition MUST align with Śiṣṭa validation",
    "IF union lacks dharmic sequencing THEN progeny status SHALL BE evaluated via consciousness-readiness metrics",
    "IF lineage integrity is preserved THEN legal identity inherits sacred authorization"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court must recognize that children born of the first four forms of marriage carry inherent spiritual capacity and social legitimacy by virtue of their origin. Legal frameworks must affirm this status without requiring punitive proof or moral scrutiny. The Court's role is to restore alignment between constitutional dharma and consciousness-derived rights.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that spiritual inheritance flows from conscious intent in union. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that sequence of ritualized consent determines ontological outcome. Responsibility lies in maintaining the purity of lineage transmission. There is no punitive element; only misalignment requires correction through awareness and realignment.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Marriage in accordance with Brāhma and related forms generates spiritually radiant progeny. Justice serves restoration, not punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is restored."
