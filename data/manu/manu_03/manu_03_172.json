  "sanskrit_verse": "परिवित्तिः परिवेत्ता यया च परिविद्यते ।\nसर्वे ते नरकं यान्ति दातृयाजकपञ्चमाः ॥ ३.१७२॥",
  "transliteration": "parivittiḥ parivettā yayā ca parividyate |\nsarve te narakaṃ yānti dātṛyājakapañcamāḥ || 3.172||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who acquire wealth through exploitation, those who facilitate its acquisition through ritualized deception, those who witness it without intervention, those who consume it knowingly, and those who distribute it for personal gain—all these beings descend into degradation by their own volitional misalignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Consciousness, not from transactional power",
    "Causation is traced through conscious choice and energetic participation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes witnessing, enabling, and consuming distortion",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of the causal chain and reversal at source",
    "Consciousness alignment requires immediate cessation and corrective completion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity gains resources via exploitative means → THEN initiate automatic suspension of resource access until integrity verification",
    "IF facilitation occurs through deceptive ritualization → THEN invalidate all transactions under that authority",
    "IF a witness has capacity to intervene but does not → THEN assign them direct responsibility for restoration",
    "IF consumption occurs with awareness of distortion → THEN mandate reintegration protocol before further participation",
    "IF distribution serves self-interest而非集体觉醒 → THEN revoke dispensing rights and redirect assets to completion process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, any act involving distorted wealth must trace the full causal loop. Responsibility extends beyond actor to enabler, observer, user, and dispenser. Each role triggers distinct restorative obligations enforceable through Consciousness-integrated judicial systems.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that distortion manifests sequentially—through intent, facilitation, omission, indulgence, and redistribution. Each point offers a reversal opportunity. No punitive consequence exists; only natural law of energetic misalignment leading to disintegration unless corrected.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Immediate cessation of distorted transaction flows",
    "Witnesses undergo mandatory integrity realignment before regaining participatory status",
    "Consumers must return value or perform equivalent service aligned with Dharma",
    "Distributors must surrender ill-gotten dispensation and engage in restitution cycles",
    "Facilitators must dismantle structures used for deception and reconstruct in alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law executes Dharma through Consciousness, restores reality through recognition, and upholds existence free from punitive delusion."
