  "sanskrit_verse": "यावदुष्मा भवत्यन्नं यावदश्नन्ति वाग्यताः ।\nपितरस्तावदश्नन्ति यावन्नओक्ता हविर्गुणाः ॥ ३.२३७॥",
  "transliteration": "yāvaduṣmā bhavatyannaṁ yāvadaśnanti vāgyatāḥ |\npitarastāvadaśnanti yāvannoktā haviguṇāḥ || 3.237 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As long as the offering retains its energetic integrity and is consumed by those authorized through speech-discipline, the ancestors remain nourished thereby; when this discipline ceases, their sustenance also ends.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from sustained spiritual discipline",
    "Causation rooted in vibrational alignment between offering and recipient",
    "Capacity-based responsibility tied to linguistic and ritual purity",
    "Restoration logic dependent on continuity of disciplined action",
    "Consciousness alignment maintained through unbroken invocation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering retains energetic integrity AND recipient maintains speech-discipline THEN ancestral nourishment continues",
    "IF recipient loses speech-discipline THEN ancestral nourishment automatically ceases",
    "IF causal link between offering and invocation is broken THEN no transfer of sustenance occurs",
    "IF lineage holder fails capacity-restoration protocol THEN inheritance of ritual duty transfers",
    "IF conscious alignment is verified THEN sustenance flows without external validation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes over ancestral rights or ritual inheritance, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable maintenance of speech-discipline. Authority hierarchies are determined not by birth alone but by sustained vibrational alignment. The court must verify the integrity of offerings and the continuity of disciplined practice rather than relying on historical claims or symbolic representation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows through disciplined vibration, not mere performance. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that disruption in speech-discipline sequentially manifests as cessation of ancestral support. Responsibility aligns with capacity to sustain energetic linkage. There is no punitive element—when discipline lapses, natural consequence follows without imposition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Re-establishment of disciplined speech patterns under guidance",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Acknowledgment of causal role in disruption",
    "Capacity restoration: Training in precise articulation and vibrational alignment",
    "Integrity reintegration: Verification of sustained practice over three lunar cycles"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed for restoration, consciousness realignment, and reintegration. Reality affirmed as non-punitive, with consciousness as the supreme adjudicator."
