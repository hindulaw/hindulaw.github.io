  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This is the first ordinance concerning the offering of Havya and Kavya; this subsequent ordinance must always be followed by those established in Sat.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Sat (Absolute Reality)",
    "Causation arises through ritual integrity and conscious participation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by ontological alignment",
    "Restoration occurs through precise repetition of Vedic ordinances",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes performative compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action involves Havya-Kavya offering THEN adherence to Prathama Kalpa is mandatory",
    "IF actor is established in Sat THEN Anukalpa compliance is binding",
    "IF deviation occurs THEN automatic restoration protocol initiates via Vedic repetition",
    "IF capacity for alignment exists THEN responsibility is fully assumed without punitive attribution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, intent and ontological establishment supersede procedural form. Where a litigant demonstrates alignment with Sat, their adherence to Anukalpa shall be presumed valid unless gross misalignment is demonstrably manifest through causal disjunction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that correct performance aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order. Misalignment generates self-corrective feedback, not punitive consequence. Responsibility flows from capacity to sustain alignment, not from error or omission.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through alignment with Sat. There is no punishment—only completion. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
