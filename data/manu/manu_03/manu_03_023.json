    "Authority flows through sequential unfoldings of consciousness capacity",

Higher unfoldings necessitate greater evidentiary thresholds for restoration eligibility. Varna-specific unfoldings define jurisdictional boundaries and competence levels in constitutional matters.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that improper action stems from incomplete sequential unfoldings rather than willful wrongdoing. Anupurvashah ensures proportional responsibility based on developmental capacity. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment results from unmet unfoldings, requiring completion processes rather than punitive measures.",
