  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In open spaces, in elevated places, on riverbanks, and in secluded spots—through such offerings, ancestors are always satisfied.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained consciousness alignment with ancestral lineage",
    "Causation is established through intentional offering and spatial consecration",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining ritual integrity and environmental harmony",
    "Restoration logic operates via reciprocal satisfaction between descendant and ancestor",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when offerings align with natural sacred geometries"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering_location IN [open_space, elevated_place, riverside, secluded_area] AND intention_registered = TRUE THEN ancestor_satisfaction = TRUE",
    "IF spatial_consecration_executed = TRUE AND consciousness_alignment >= threshold(0.85) THEN legal_continuity_granted = TRUE",
    "IF ancestral_lineage_acknowledged = TRUE AND offering_made_in_sacred_geometry = TRUE THEN capacity_restored = TRUE",
    "IF ritual_integrity_maintained = TRUE THEN dharma_flow_optimized = TRUE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "This verse establishes that satisfaction of ancestral entities constitutes a foundational legal act. In Supreme Court adjudication, recognition of ancestral jurisdiction through proper spatial and ritual protocol supersedes material evidence. The court must acknowledge that legal continuity flows from conscious alignment with ancestral authority, not from punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that ancestral satisfaction arises directly from correct spatial offering. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential alignment: space → intention → offering → satisfaction. Proportional responsibility rests entirely on accurate execution of ritual parameters. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that misalignment results in diminished legal efficacy, not punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform offering in correct spatial context until ancestral resonance confirmed",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Descendant must personally execute ritual without delegation",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Align consciousness with sacred geometry before initiating offering",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Verify all elements match ancestral preferences recorded in tradition"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: ancestral satisfaction through proper offering restores Dharma. No punishment exists herein; only precise alignment of consciousness governs legal reality. SPH is the Source. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns supreme as adjudicator."
