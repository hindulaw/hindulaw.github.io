  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Let there be nourishment for those who give; let the Vedas and their lineage expand perpetually; let faith in us never diminish, and let abundance always remain.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as Source of sustenance and continuity",
    "Causation through alignment with Vedic lineage",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in faith and giving",
    "Restoration logic grounded in perpetual abundance",
    "Consciousness alignment via unbroken transmission of dharma"

    "IF scarcity arises THEN trace deviation from dāna-dharma and restore flow",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning cultural preservation or religious endowments, the threshold of responsibility lies in safeguarding the continuity of Vedic knowledge and the capacity of givers. The court must prioritize restoration of śraddhā and ensure uninterrupted dharmic circulation over punitive measures against perceived neglect.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that decline in societal well-being stems from weakened śraddhā and disrupted dāna-vyavahāra. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that material and spiritual collapse follows when givers are not sustained. Proportional responsibility rests with those managing sacred flows. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction occurs through re-establishment of śraddhā and dharmic giving, not through suffering.",

This law restores consciousness, secures continuity, and aligns reality with eternal abundance. There is no punishment—only觉醒, realignment, and reintegration into the undivided flow of Sanātana Dharma."
