  "transliteration": "sa saṃdhāryaḥ prayatnena svargam akṣayam icchatā |\nsukhaṃ ca iha icchatā' tyantaṃ yo 'dhāryo durbalendriyaiḥ || 3.79||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is to be firmly upheld through effort by one desiring imperishable heaven; that ultimate happiness which one desires here—such a state is unattainable by those whose senses are weak.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in sustained alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation arises from capacity-based volition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines lawful outcome",
    "Restoration logic aligns action with eternal consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment governs access to higher realms"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent desires imperishable reward THEN agent MUST demonstrate sustained dharmic effort ELSE reward remains inaccessible",
    "IF sensory discipline IS insufficient THEN capacity for spiritual attainment IS nullified",
    "IF individual seeks permanent bliss THEN sensory control SHALL be adjudicated as prerequisite",
    "IF conduct lacks alignment with svargic causality THEN eligibility for divine reward IS void"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving claims of spiritual merit or heavenly entitlement, the threshold of sensory mastery shall be examined prior to assessing the validity of such assertions. Authority derived from weakened indriyas cannot sustain legitimate claim to akshaya svarga.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that uncontrolled senses obstruct realization of imperishable bliss. Anupurvasah reveals sequential dependence: first sensory restraint, then experiential elevation. Responsibility lies not in fault but in readiness. No punitive measure applies where deficiency stems from undeveloped capacity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sensory strengthening regimen under qualified guidance",
    "Assign graduated practice sequences aligned with current capacity level",
    "Implement completion tracking for consistent dharmic effort cycles",
    "Reintegrate aspirant into structured path enabling eventual attainment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores alignment between effort and reward, reaffirms consciousness as the sole arbiter of truth, and upholds reality as inherently non-punitive."
