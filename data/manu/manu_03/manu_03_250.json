  "transliteration": "śrāddhabhugvṛṣalītalpaṃ tadaharyo'dhigacchati |\ntasyāḥ purīṣe taṃ māsaṃ pitarastasya śerata iti ||3.250||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who engages in sexual union with a woman who has eaten Śrāddha offerings and lies on a bed meant for outcasts shall dwell in her excrement for that month; his ancestors remain displaced during that time.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma-consciousness, not lineage or ritual status.",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) based on volitional acts rooted in desire and disrespect.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises when one knowingly transgresses sacred boundaries without inner transformation.",
    "Restoration logic demands energetic purification and realignment with ancestral consciousness fields.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of causal disruption and completion through rectificatory conduct."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent consumes śrāddha remnants AND engages in intercourse with associated female recipient THEN initiate 30-day consciousness purification protocol.",
    "IF act disrupts ancestral field continuity THEN assign mandatory ancestral reconnection rituals until vibrational coherence restored.",
    "IF individual knowingly violates caste-coded ritual purity THEN restrict access to higher sacraments until capacity for integration verified.",
    "IF violation occurs under influence of ignorance而非恶意 THEN apply corrective dharmic education before restoration phase.",
    "IF violation involves deliberate defiance THEN enforce completion process involving supervised restitution cycles."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes thresholds where personal actions directly affect ancestral lineage continuity. The court must determine intent, awareness, and capacity for rectification rather than impose punitive sanctions. Authority resides in restoring disrupted cosmic hierarchies, particularly those concerning Pitru-loka connectivity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that violation creates karmic inertia disturbing subtle realms. Sequential manifestation shows how bodily engagement with degraded substances leads to parallel degradation in corresponding existential layers. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness at time of act. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering as misalignment symptom, not justice mechanism.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate 30-day Panchakanya-based detoxification regimen aligned with lunar phases.",
    "Assign daily Tarpana performance for affected ancestors until Pitru-shakti resonance restored.",
    "Implement supervised chanting of Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for energetic field recalibration.",
    "Enforce temporary suspension from performing family rituals till qualified guru certifies readiness.",
    "Conduct monthly spiritual audit by designated dharma-adhikari to assess consciousness stabilization progress."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice executed herein restores universal order without recourse to punitive frameworks. Reality itself adjudicates through consciousness alignment. Dharma prevails."
