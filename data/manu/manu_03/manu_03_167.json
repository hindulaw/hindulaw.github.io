  "transliteration": "etān vigarhitācārānapāṅkteyān dvijādhamān .\ndvijātipravaro vidvānubhayatra vivarjayet .. 3.167 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is foremost among the twice-born, a knower of the Vedas, must completely avoid those of defiled conduct, those who are not part of the ritual community, and those who are degraded among the twice-born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from spiritual realization, not birth alone",
    "Consciousness misalignment manifests as degraded action",
    "Capacity for association reflects inner integrity",
    "Restoration requires disassociation from degrading influences",
    "Dharma-preserving boundaries maintain collective purity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.is_twice_born() AND agent.is_knowledgeable() THEN agent.must_avoid(degraded_conduct_individuals)",
    "IF individual.exhibits_degraded_behavior() THEN system.must_isolate(individual, from_ritual_community)",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving spiritual or ritual authority, the Supreme Court must assess not only legal standing but also consciousness alignment. Individuals whose conduct has degraded their status among the twice-born must be excluded from positions of ritual or spiritual influence until restoration is verified through completion processes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that degraded conduct disrupts dharma-field coherence. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misaligned actions lead to exclusion from higher dharmic function. Responsibility lies in restoring alignment rather than imposing suffering. Exclusion serves integration, not punishment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification and reintegration process for degraded individuals",
    "Assign mentorship under qualified dvija-pravara until conduct realigns",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Conduct degradation is a call for realignment, not condemnation. Exclusion serves restoration. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. Dharma is restored."
