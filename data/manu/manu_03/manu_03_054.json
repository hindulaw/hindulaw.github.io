  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters where familial or societal structures override individual consent, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying authentic self-alignment. Authority hierarchies must defer to the sovereign integrity of the person involved. The court must ensure restoration of dignity over punitive measures against familial actors.",
