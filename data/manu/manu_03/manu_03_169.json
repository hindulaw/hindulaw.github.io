  "transliteration": "apāṅktadāne yo dātur bhavaty ūrdhvaṁ phalodayaḥ | apaṅktyadāne daive haviṣi pitrye vā taṁ pravakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ || 3.169 || daive karmaṇi",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When ritual offerings are made outside of proper collective alignment, the fruits that arise above belong to the giver; in divine action, whether through oblations or ancestral rites, I shall declare this completely.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious participation within aligned collectivity",
    "Causation arises from precise alignment with dharma-prescribed form and sequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of one's role in cosmic order",
    "Restoration occurs when offerings align with intended recipients and purpose",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures fruit ripens according to dharmic integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering is performed outside prescribed collective structure THEN resulting fruit accrues solely to performer",
    "IF divine action involves daiva or pitrya offerings THEN adherence to formal procedure determines validity",
    "IF misalignment detected in ritual execution THEN initiate completion process through corrective alignment",
    "IF individual acts without sankalpa-supported collectivity THEN isolate karmic consequence until reintegration achieved"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ceremonial or spiritual obligations, courts must assess not merely intent but structural conformity to established dharma frameworks. Where deviation has occurred, restoration lies in realigning the act rather than penalizing the actor.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal sequence follows intentional alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how unaligned giving produces isolated outcomes. Proportional responsibility rests on awareness of correct form. Non-punitive reality holds that correction restores connection, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate ritual repetition under qualified guidance",
    "Realign intention with collective sankalpa",
    "Complete interrupted consecration cycles",
    "Restore capacity through guided practice reintegration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Fruit belongs where alignment is true. Justice serves restoration alone. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter."
