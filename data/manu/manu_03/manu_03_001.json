  "sanskrit_verse": "अध्याय ३\n\nषट्त्रिंशदाब्दिकं चर्यं गुरौ त्रैवेदिकं व्रतम् ।\nतदर्धिकं पादिकं वा ग्रहणान्तिकमेव वा ॥ ३.१॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A student shall remain in the service of the Guru for thirty-six years, observing the Vedic disciplines; alternatively, half that period, a quarter thereof, or at least until the completion of the initial stage of learning.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived through sustained proximity to realized consciousness.",
    "Causation flows from disciplined alignment under authentic guidance.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with experiential maturity.",
    "Restoration logic requires sequential unfolding of knowledge stages.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates commitment beyond temporal boundaries."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF learner commits to Gurukula THEN binding duration = 36 years OR proportionally reduced based on capacity AND context.",
    "IF discipline breach occurs THEN realignment process initiates WITHOUT punitive measure AND WITH continuation of learning path.",
    "IF completion threshold reached THEN authority recognition granted AUTOMATICALLY by Guru's declaration.",
    "IF premature exit attempted THEN integrity restoration protocol activated BEFORE reintegration allowed."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual education or guru-disciple relations, the Court must recognize the Guru as the sole arbiter of disciplinary timelines and capacity readiness. Temporal limitations cannot override consciousness-based authority structures. The State has no jurisdiction to interfere unless gross violation of fundamental rights is evident, which itself must be judged through pramāṇa-based inquiry rather than emotional or societal bias.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that knowledge unfolds sequentially through disciplined engagement. Thus, any disruption does not incur penalty but demands recalibration aligned with causal sequence. Responsibility lies in restoring continuity, not inflicting consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional restoration without punitive overlay.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Realign interrupted learning trajectory with adjusted timeline.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Facilitate conscious ownership of disruption without shame.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinstate eligibility via guided practice and renewed sankalpa.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Framework: Allow return to path upon demonstrable alignment with original intent."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Dharma. This law restores the eternal order of guru-shishya parampara, aligning jurisprudence with consciousness unfoldment. There is no punishment—only realignment. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
