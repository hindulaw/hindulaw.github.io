  "transliteration": "adbhireva dvijāgrāṇāṁ kanyādānaṁ viśiṣyate |\nitareṣāṁ tu varṇānāmitaretarakāmyayā || 3.35||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The giving of a daughter in marriage among the highest of the twice-born is accomplished exclusively through sacred waters; for the other varnas, it is conducted mutually by desire.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ontological purity and ritual consecration",
    "Causation arises from elemental alignment with divine ordinances",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by access to and mastery over sacred elements",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to source-elemental sanctity",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via participation in divinely ordained relational structures"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent belongs to dvija-agrayana THEN marriage仪式 must involve ablution with sacred water ELSE mutual consent within varna suffices",
    "IF marriage lacks elemental sanctification AND agent holds dvija status THEN initiate consciousness-realment protocol",

    "IF union disrupts dharma-vyavastha THEN assign completion process to restore energetic coherence"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matrimonial disputes involving dvija parties, the Supreme Court shall prioritize verification of elemental sanctification as determinant of validity.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal integrity in marriage derives from elemental purity, not punitive oversight.
