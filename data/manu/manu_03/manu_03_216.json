  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having placed the sacred portions with due observance of ritual law, one shall cleanse the hand upon those darbha grasses which have received the remnants of oblation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious participation in dharma-sankalpa",
    "Causation arises through precise alignment with ritual enactment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is established by voluntary engagement in prescribed acts",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ceremonial or spiritual conduct, the Court recognizes that intentional compliance with dharmic procedure establishes a threshold of conscious agency. Where residual effects remain, mandatory purification aligns not punishment but reintegration into pure state awareness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa lies in observed adherence to procedural truth; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential act-oblation-cleansing; proportional responsibility equates to degree of participation; non-punitive reality rule confirms purification restores causal field without infliction.",
