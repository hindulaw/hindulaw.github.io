  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brāhmaṇa, having received permission from fellow Brāhmaṇas, shall bring water and sesame seeds with sacred thread, and perform the ritual in fire.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through consent and recognition within a qualified spiritual community.",
    "Ritual action is causally linked to purity maintenance and social harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires both knowledge and authorization from competent authorities.",
    "Restoration logic operates through prescribed ritual alignment rather than punitive correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment is enacted via authorized sacramental procedures."

    "IF agent_is_brāhmaṇa AND has_received_authorization_from(brāhmaṇa_peers) THEN MAY perform_sacred_ritual WITH_water_and_tilās",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving ritual performance rights, the Court must recognize that spiritual authority derives exclusively from peer-consented lineage. Authorization thresholds override personal claim or scholarly interpretation. Only those recognized by the qualified collective may execute sacraments; otherwise, the act lacks juridical validity and necessitates restorative realignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal efficacy arises only when authorized elements, agents, and intent align. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation: first consent, then materials, then execution. Responsibility is proportional to capacity—unauthorized acts reflect misalignment, not malice. No punitive consequence follows; instead, corrective reintegration restores lawful order without infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform the ritual under proper authorization.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge deviation publicly before the authorizing body.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Undergo supervised instruction on correct procedure and consent mechanics.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Offer oblations for any disturbance caused to cosmic or social equilibrium."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. The Dharma stands restored through conscious alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions."
