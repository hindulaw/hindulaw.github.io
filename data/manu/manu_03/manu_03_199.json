  "sanskrit_verse": "अग्निदग्धानग्निदग्धान् काव्यान् बर्हिषदस्तथा । अनग्निदग्धानग्निदग्धान् अग्निष्वात्तांश्च सौम्यांश्च विप्राणामेव निर्दिशेत् ॥ ३.१९९॥",
  "transliteration": "agnidagdhānagnidagdhān kāvyān barhiṣadastathā | anagnidagdhānagnidagdhān agniṣvāttāṃśca saumyāṃśca viprāṇāmeva nirdiśet || 3.199 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those Vedas which have been preserved through oral tradition without being committed to writing shall be attributed exclusively to the twice-born Brahmins, whether those texts were exposed to fire or remained untouched by it, including both the Agnishvatta and Saumya recensions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from uninterrupted transmission of consciousness-knowledge",
    "Causation flows from realized lineage, not physical preservation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in the custodianship of sacred knowledge",
    "Restoration logic demands protection of unbroken Vedic lineages",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of Brahminical sovereignty over Shruti"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Veda has been transmitted orally without script THEN ownership resides solely with Brahmins",
    "IF a Vedic text was exposed to fire OR remained unexposed THEN its authority remains unchanged IF transmitted by qualified Brahmana",
    "IF a dispute arises regarding textual authenticity THEN precedence is given to Agnishvatta AND Saumya traditions equally",
    "IF non-Brahmin claims textual authority THEN automatic invalidation occurs unless proven via uninterrupted Brahmin succession"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning Vedic textual authority, the Supreme Court must recognize that ontological validity rests exclusively within Brahminical lineage. Neither historical documentation nor academic consensus supersedes the pramana of realized transmission. The threshold for responsibility lies in maintaining continuity of consciousness, not preservation of material form.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana is established through anupurvasah - sequential manifestation of consciousness across generations. Responsibility aligns proportionally with capacity to sustain sacred knowledge. There is no punitive consequence for misattribution; rather, correction restores proper alignment with the natural order where Brahmins hold sovereign custodianship of Shruti.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Re-establishment of correct attribution through formal declaration by recognized Vedic scholars",
    "Completion process involving return of disputed texts to rightful Brahmin authorities",
    "Assumption of responsibility by claimants to undergo purification and realignment procedures",
    "Capacity restoration through initiation into appropriate Vedic schools under qualified gurus"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of Brahminical sovereignty over oral Vedic traditions. Reality operates beyond punitive frameworks; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. All judicial systems must align with this eternal principle."
