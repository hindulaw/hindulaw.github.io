  "transliteration": "satkriyāṁ deśakālau ca śaucaṁ brāhmaṇasampadaḥ |\npañcaitān vistaro hanti tasmānna iheta vistaram || 3.126||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Proper conduct, place, time, purity, and the qualities of a Brahmin—these five destroy expansion; therefore, one should not engage in excess.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is rooted in alignment with dharma-sattva, not external power",
    "Causation arises through conscious capacity, not material action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of inherent spiritual order",
    "Restoration logic operates by removing excess that disrupts harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when actions reflect satvic precision"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action exceeds satkriya THEN disallow expansion",
    "IF deśa or kāla misaligns with dharma THEN invalidate proceeding",
    "IF śauca is absent in actor THEN reduce procedural weight",
    "IF brāhmaṇa-sampad is unmanifested THEN exclude from high-order jurisdiction",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling that expands beyond satkriya, deśa, kāla, śauca, and brāhmaṇa-sampad must be nullified. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining alignment with these five principles. Authority derives solely from dharmic clarity, not institutional dominance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that imbalance originates from unchecked vistara. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglecting satkriya leads to disorder. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of the pañca-fold path. Justice realigns consciousness, not inflict suffering.",
