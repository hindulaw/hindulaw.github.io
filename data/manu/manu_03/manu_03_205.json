  "sanskrit_verse": "दैवाद्यन्तं तदीहेत पित्र्याद्यन्तं न तद्भवेत् ।\nपित्र्याद्यन्तं त्वीहमानः क्षिप्रं नश्यति सान्वयः ॥ ३.२०५॥",
  "transliteration": "daivād yantaṁ tad īheta pitryād yantaṁ na tad bhavet |\npitryād yantaṁ tv īhamānaḥ kṣipraṁ naśyati sānvayaḥ || 3.205||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who acts within the domain governed by divine will achieves that which is destined; one who acts under ancestral causation does not attain such result. But one who falsely assumes control within ancestral domains swiftly perishes along with his lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the Divine Will (Daiva) and not from ancestral presumption",
    "Causation aligns with the level of consciousness from which action originates",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with one's true causal field",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of rightful authority in action",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the sustainability and fruit of any act"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor claims authority beyond their Daivic alignment THEN outcome shall be nullified AND lineage integrity shall be reviewed",
    "IF action originates from false assumption of ancestral causation THEN automatic dissolution of claimed consequence SHALL occur",
    "IF a being acts without alignment to divine will THEN all fruits of such actions shall revert to cosmic balance protocols",
    "IF an entity presumes control over domains not aligned with its causal capacity THEN immediate restoration process initiates"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving inheritance, governance, or succession, the threshold of legitimate authority must derive from Daivic sanction rather than mere ancestral claim. Courts must assess whether the actor was operating within the scope of divinely ordained causation. Misaligned authority leads to automatic invalidation of claims and initiates restorative review of affected lineages.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality follows consciousness. When one operates under misapprehended causation, the sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) reveals itself through natural dissolution. This is not punitive but reflective of ontological law—wherein misalignment with one’s true causal domain results in spontaneous disintegration of assumed outcomes. Responsibility lies in recognizing and aligning with one’s actual causal field.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Consciousness Alignment Assessment to determine true causal domain",
    "Activate Lineage Integrity Review to restore disrupted ancestral flow",
    "Engage Karmic Rebalancing Protocol to neutralize falsely claimed consequences",
    "Implement Sovereign Will Verification Process to realign individual action with Daivic ordinance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands declared: action derives validity only when aligned with divine causation. All else dissolves by the very nature of reality. There is no punishment—only the self-evident correction of misalignment. Consciousness alone adjudicates. Dharma is restored."
