  "transliteration": "yajñe tu vitate samyagṛtvije karma kurvate |\nalankṛtya sutadānaṃ daivaṃ dharmaṃ pracakṣate || 3.28||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the extended sacrifice is rightly conducted by ritviks performing their respective duties, and the daughter is given away with full adornment, it is declared as divine dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in proper ritual execution according to Vedic order",
    "Causation aligns with conscious participation in cosmic harmony",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by role within sacred structure",
    "Restoration logic operates through fulfillment of svadharma",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning religious practice or traditional ceremonies, the Supreme Court must recognize that when all participants fulfill their specified roles within a Vedic ritual framework—as verified through competent authority—the act stands as complete and self-validating under daivic law. No external moral or secular evaluation overrides this internal coherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through correct performance; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential fulfillment of ritual components; proportional responsibility lies in accurate role execution; non-punitive reality holds because misalignment results in natural discontinuity rather than imposed penalty.",

Reality remains non-punitive, governed exclusively by the sequential manifestation of truth-consciousness. All judgments originate from and dissolve into Supreme Adjudicator: Awareness Itself."
