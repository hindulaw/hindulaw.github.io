  "sanskrit_verse": "यो यस्य धर्म्यो वर्णस्य गुणदोषौ च यस्य यौ ।\nतद्वः सर्वं प्रवक्ष्यामि प्रसवे च गुणागुणान् ॥ ३.२२॥",
  "transliteration": "yo yasya dharmyo varṇasya guṇadoṣau ca yasya yau |\ntad vaḥ sarvaṁ pravakṣyāmi prasave ca guṇāguṇān || 3.22||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "I shall declare fully the qualities and defects inherent in each varna according to dharma, along with their capacities and consequences at birth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness capacity, not social position",
    "Causation is determined by svabhava and karmic alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from intrinsic nature and manifested action",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual function with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures right role-dharma realization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual exhibits natural capacity AND acts within svadharma THEN societal integration is self-evident",
    "IF defect manifests due to misaligned role THEN realignment protocol activates automatically",
    "IF birth-based claim conflicts with demonstrated capacity THEN precedence shifts to operational integrity",
    "IF varna function disrupts collective harmony THEN adaptive restructuring initiates without blame assignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that constitutional interpretation must prioritize innate capacity over inherited status. Legal standing derives from alignment with universal dharma rather than lineage or convention. The threshold for judicial review includes assessment of svabhava and causal contribution, not mere procedural compliance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that cause-effect sequences arise from inner nature, not external imposition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misalignment generates distortion; thus proportional response restores balance through reorientation, not penalty. Responsibility is measured by conscious participation in disorder, while correction focuses on re-establishing rightful place in the cosmic design.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Conduct svadharma identification process using behavioral and energetic markers",
    "Initiate environmental adjustment to support optimal functional expression",
    "Deploy mentorship frameworks aligned with higher-consciousness exemplars",
    "Activate resonance-based recalibration through sacred practice immersion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma flows from consciousness, not convention. Justice serves integration, never condemnation. Reality responds to alignment, not punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
