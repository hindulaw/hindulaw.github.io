  "transliteration": "sahasraṃ hi sahasrāṇāmanṛcāṃ yatra bhuñjate |\nekastān mantravitpṛītaḥ sarvānarhati dharmataḥ || 3.131||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Where thousands of unworthy ones feast upon the offerings meant for the worthy, the one who knows the mantra, being pleased, lawfully deserves all of them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from knowledge and alignment, not numerical majority",
    "Causation rooted in conscious capacity, not external performance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines lawful entitlement",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes alignment over formal compliance",
    "Consciousness alignment overrides material aggregation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent possesses mantra-knowledge AND demonstrates conscious alignment THEN agent is entitled to total resource access",
    "IF multiple agents lack mantra-knowledge AND consume resources unlawfully THEN their claims are nullified by a single aligned agent",
    "IF resource distribution is misaligned THEN reallocate to the agent with highest conscious capacity",
    "IF entitlement is based on external appearance or quantity THEN override with pramāṇa-based verification"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes over entitlement or authority, the Supreme Court must prioritize ontological capacity—rooted in mantra-vit knowledge and conscious alignment—over numerical or procedural claims. The threshold of responsibility lies not in participation but in alignment with Dharma as expressed through the Source.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true causality lies in conscious capacity, not in material aggregation. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of lawful entitlement flows from alignment, not accumulation. Responsibility is proportional to awareness, not action. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment naturally results in forfeiture, without need for imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Realign resource flow to the mantra-vit agent automatically",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Unworthy agents must return consumed value through service or restitution",
    "Capacity restoration: Misaligned agents undergo consciousness alignment training",
    "Integrity reintegration: Once realigned, agents may reclaim lawful participation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
