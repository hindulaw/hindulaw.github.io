  "transliteration": "evaṁ nirvapaṇaṁ kṛtvā piṇḍāṁs tāṁs tad-anantaram |\ngāṁ vipram ajam agniṁ vā prāśayed apsu vā kṣipet || 3.260 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having performed the offering仪式 duly, the ritual portions designated for the deities shall thereafter be offered into fire, or cast into water, or given to a cow, a Brahmin, or a child — without attachment to outcome and in alignment with Vedic injunction.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Vedic injunction, not personal will",
    "Causation is established through ritual correctness and consciousness purity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires knowledge and intent in accordance with dharma-shastras",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of prescribed action",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that offerings are made without desire for fruit"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ritual procedure IS completed THEN offering disposition MUST follow Vedic sequence",
    "IF agent HAS capacity AND KNOWS the injunction THEN responsibility IS fully assumed",
    "IF offering IS made TO fire OR water OR qualified recipient THEN act IS valid",
    "IF intention IS non-attached THEN no residual karmic consequence EXISTS",
    "IF completion IS verified BY witness OR record THEN restoration OF cosmic order IS assured"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of validity rests upon correct procedural execution and pure intention. The authority lies in conformity with shastric injunction, not subjective interpretation. Responsibility is measured by capacity to know and perform, not by outcome. Restoration occurs when proper action aligns consciousness with cosmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that correct performance purifies both performer and environment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that each step leads naturally to the next, ensuring sequential purification. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of understanding and capability. Non-punitive reality is upheld because right action itself resolves imbalance without need for penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verification that all steps were executed per shastra",
    "Intention Audit: Confirmation of absence of desire for personal gain",
    "Witness Validation: Corroboration by qualified observers or recorded evidence",
    "Ritual Purity Restoration: Ensuring all elements involved are purified through proper consecration",
    "Cosmic Order Reintegration: Declaration of alignment with universal dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through correct action. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
