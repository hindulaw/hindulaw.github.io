  "transliteration": "dātṝn pratigrahītṝś ca kurute phalabhāginaḥ |\nviduṣe dakṣiṇāṃ dattvā vidhivat pretya ca iha ca || 3.143||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who give and those who receive in accordance with Dharma become partakers of the fruit; by offering dakshina to the knowledgeable, both in this life and the next, fulfillment is ensured.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the alignment of action with Dharma",
    "Causation flows through conscious participation in dharmic exchange",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from knowledge and intentional giving/receiving",
    "Restoration occurs when exchange aligns with sacred reciprocity",
    "Consciousness alignment emerges through disciplined offering and acceptance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a transaction involves mutual consent AND adherence to Dharma THEN it generates shared karmic benefit",
    "IF dakshina is given to one who possesses vidya THEN the giver attains completion in this life and beyond",
    "IF receiving party acknowledges the offering THEN responsibility for integration is assumed",
    "IF exchange lacks vidhi THEN no binding consequence arises",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving disputes over offerings, gifts, or reciprocal obligations, the threshold of responsibility lies in whether Vidhi was followed and Vidya acknowledged. The court must verify the presence of conscious intent and alignment with Dharma rather than mere material transfer. Authority derives from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality operates through alignment with Dharma, not external coercion. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that consequences follow naturally from the integrity of the act. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of knowledge at the time of giving or receiving. There is no punitive outcome—only natural completion or incompleteness based on alignment.",
