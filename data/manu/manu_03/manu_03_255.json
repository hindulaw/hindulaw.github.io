  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The afternoon period is designated for darbha grass; the establishment of dwelling is marked by sesame seeds; creation itself proceeds through acquisition and purification; among the twice-born, those who are foremost in performing shraddha rites possess true wealth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ritual integrity and cosmic alignment",
    "Causation arises through dharmic timing and material consecration",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual precedence and ritual mastery",

    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action aligns with sanctioned temporal and spatial structures"

Priority shall be accorded to those demonstrating mastery in ancestral rituals such as shraddha, indicating elevated spiritual capacity and societal integration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through precise correspondence between act, timing, and substance. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of ritual competence leading to societal harmony. Responsibility is proportional to demonstrated mastery of dharma-sanketa. Justice functions not through penalty but through reaffirmation of rightful place within the cosmic-social structure.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. There is no punishment. Reality responds only to alignment with Sanatana Vakya. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
