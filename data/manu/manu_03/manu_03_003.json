  "transliteration": "taṃ pratītaṃ svadharmeṇa brahmadaayaharaṃ pituḥ |\nsragviṇaṃ talpa āsīnamarhayetprathamaṃ gavā || 3.3||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has been recognized by the father as having fulfilled his own dharma and taken up the responsibility of transmitting Brahman knowledge shall be honored first with cows while adorned with a garland and seated on a bed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from recognition of dharmic capacity",
    "Causation arises through conscious alignment with svadharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines precedence in honor",
    "Restoration occurs through public acknowledgment of spiritual succession",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests via ritualized affirmation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual is publicly acknowledged by their predecessor as fulfilling svadharma AND assuming transmission responsibilities THEN they MUST receive primary ceremonial honor",
    "IF ceremonial protocol initiates THEN highest-value offering (cow) SHALL precede all others",
    "IF seated position AND garland present THEN legal status ascends to successor level",
    "IF no prior contradiction recorded THEN acknowledgment stands unchallenged",
    "IF spiritual succession affirmed THEN social integration accelerates automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning lineage rights or succession disputes within traditional orders, the court must recognize that explicit paternal acknowledgment—when aligned with demonstrated dharmic conduct—establishes immediate legal primacy over challengers lacking such validation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Recognition follows pramāṇa-based verification of svadharma fulfillment; causal sequence begins with internal alignment manifesting externally through paternal acknowledgment; proportional response requires ceremonial elevation without punitive exclusion of others; non-punitive reality ensures harmony rather than adversarial competition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Confirm father's witnessed satisfaction with disciple's conduct",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Verify active engagement in Brahman transmission duties",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinforce societal acceptance through formal gifting仪式",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Public seating confirms stabilized spiritual authority"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law executes pure Dharma: consciousness prevails over contention, restoration replaces retaliation, and succession honors truth."
