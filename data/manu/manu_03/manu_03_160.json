  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who initiates the use of weapons, leads in ritual kindling, engages in treacherous gambling, or instructs a son or student in destructive conduct—such persons bear full causal-authority for consequences arising therefrom.",

    "Authority inheres in initiation and instruction",
    "Causation arises through direct enabling of action",

    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of source-level causality"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent initiates weapon deployment THEN assign primary causal liability",
    "IF individual leads sacred fire ritual THEN bind to purity maintenance obligation",
    "IF person facilitates deceitful gambling THEN enforce integrity realignment protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility lies with initiators and instructors. Hierarchy of authority determines quantum of liability. Restorative justice supersedes punitive frameworks by aligning causal agents with origin-consciousness correction.",

Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation from intent to act. Proportional responsibility flows from degree of influence.
