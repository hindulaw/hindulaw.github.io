  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If the donor is lame, or blind, or otherwise physically impaired, or has been sent by another, or is deficient or excessive in bodily parts, then he too shall be removed from the act of giving.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that incomplete embodiment disrupts causal continuity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that a defective instrument cannot sustain lawful manifestation.
