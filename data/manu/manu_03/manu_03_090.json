  "transliteration": "viśvebhyaśaiva devebhyo balim ākāśa utkṣipet |\ndivācarebhyo bhūtebhyo naktañcāribhya eva ca || 3.90 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Let oblations be offered into the sky for all beings—gods, day-wanderers, night-wanderers—and all creatures universally.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from recognition of universal divinity in all beings.",
    "Causation arises through conscious offering that aligns with cosmic order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is fulfilled by acknowledging interdependence among all forms of existence.",
    "Restoration occurs when offerings dissolve ego-boundary and establish unity-consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through acts of reverence toward all strata of creation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity performs ritual or material offering THEN ensure inclusion of all sentient and non-sentient domains within invocation scope.",
    "IF action involves environmental impact THEN obligation extends to unseen entities including aerial, terrestrial, and nocturnal forces.",
    "IF agent engages in economic exchange THEN proportionate share must be allocated to sustain ecological and spiritual equilibrium.",
    "IF violation detected in transaction THEN completion process requires restitution via expanded offering mechanism encompassing affected realms.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving resource allocation, public welfare, or environmental harm, the court shall recognize that every act has multidimensional consequences affecting visible and invisible stakeholders. Legal thresholds must expand beyond anthropocentric frameworks to include divine, elemental, and temporal agencies. Responsibility is determined not by intent alone but by alignment with universal reciprocity laws embodied in sacrificial consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through perception of interconnectedness; therefore, neglecting any domain disrupts harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential degradation when offerings cease. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring balance without assigning blame. The non-punitive reality rule upholds that correction flows naturally once alignment resumes with the totality of existence.",

    "Completion Process: Mandated ceremonial offering to re-establish connection with neglected domains.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Individual or institution acknowledges unseen dependencies contributing to outcome.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Reintroduction to practices fostering awareness of coexistence with all beings.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public or private ritual reaffirming commitment to holistic accountability."

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through conscious offering. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
