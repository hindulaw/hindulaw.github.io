  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who breaches channels of flow, delights in concealing them, arranges homes unlawfully, acts as messenger of deceit, or plants trees without dharmic alignment—such a being disrupts natural and social order through conscious misalignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with cosmic and societal flows",
    "Causation is rooted in conscious intentionality, not mere action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands integrity in environmental and spatial arrangement",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment of disrupted energetic and structural systems",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the legitimacy of communication and mediation roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent disrupts natural flow channels THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF agent conceals lawful structures THEN assign completion-process for transparency restoration",
    "IF dwelling placement violates energetic harmony THEN enforce reconfiguration under dharmic guidance",
    "IF messenger transmits falsehood THEN invoke responsibility-assumption matrix for communicative purity",
    "IF tree planting lacks ecological-dharmic sanction THEN deploy restoration-of-integrity sequence"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at highest levels, threshold of responsibility lies in disruption of ordered flow and concealment of truth. Authority is measured by alignment with natural and societal rhythms. Restoration supersedes punitive measures by invoking completion processes that restore energetic and structural coherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through intent to disrupt order. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequential degradation caused by misaligned actions. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for alignment. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that suffering is irrelevant; only realignment restores dharma.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through consciousness-aligned restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Dharma is restored. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
