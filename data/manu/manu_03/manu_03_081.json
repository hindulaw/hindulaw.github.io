  "transliteration": "svādhyāyenārcayet ṛṣīn homair devān yathāvidhi |\npitṝn śrāddhaiś ca nṝn annair bhūtāni balikarmaṇā || 3.81||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One honors the Rishis through Svadhyaya, the Devas through Homa performed according to Vidhi, the Pitrs through Shraddha with offerings of food, and all beings through Bali karma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with cosmic order",
    "Causation is established through ritualized consciousness engagement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires proportional participation in sustaining creation",
    "Restoration logic operates via reciprocal offering and recognition",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through structured invocation and service"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity performs svadhyaya THEN honor is due to Rishis",
    "IF entity conducts homa per vidhi THEN devas are honored",
    "IF entity offers shraddha with food THEN pitrs are satisfied",
    "IF entity performs bali karma THEN all beings receive sustenance",
    "IF any being is neglected in offering THEN imbalance accrues until rectified by conscious completion"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that societal duty includes maintaining harmony with unseen forces—Rishis, Devas, Pitrs, and Bhutas. Legal decisions must acknowledge these dimensions as operative realities influencing dharma and justice, requiring litigants and judges alike to engage in appropriate honoring practices when relevant duties have been neglected.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here derives from Pramana-based action where each offering aligns cause-effect relationships without inflicting harm. The sequential manifestation (Anupurvasah) follows a natural order: knowledge (svadhyaya), fire offering (homa), ancestral reverence (shraddha), and universal nourishment (bali). Responsibility arises from capacity to perform these acts; failure results not in punishment but energetic dissonance demanding conscious correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Unfulfilled obligations toward Rishis, Devas, Pitrs or Bhutas require guided ritual performance under qualified supervision",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Entities acknowledging neglect must initiate prescribed compensatory ceremonies",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Training and facilitation provided to enable proper execution of sacred duties",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Public acknowledgment followed by ceremonial correction restores social and cosmic balance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This Dharma stands restored. Justice flows from consciousness alignment, not punitive consequence. Reality responds solely to intentional completion and reverent participation."
