  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving traditional practice or constitutional ethos rooted in Vedic continuity, the Court shall recognize that lawful invocation follows a prescribed ontological sequence. The threshold of spiritual or cultural authority lies in correct alignment with primordial principles—not mere repetition of form. Hierarchy reflects resonance with foundational consciousness fields.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through proper invocation order; anupūrvaśaḥ ensures results follow intentional alignment.
