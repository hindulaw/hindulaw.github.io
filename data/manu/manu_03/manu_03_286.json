  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This entire arrangement of duties and laws concerning the five great sacrifices has been declared for the sustenance of the twice-born and their principal conduct; let this ordinance be heard and enacted.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained spiritual order, not temporal power",
    "Causation arises through alignment with Vedic sacrifice and dharmic function",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by birth-endowed duty and consciousness readiness",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to sacrificial duty and societal harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via performance of svadharma in accordance with Varna-ashrama"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.birth_status == 'dvija' AND agent.age >= initiation_age THEN agent.duty_set INCLUDES pancayajna",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication involving dvija litigants, precedence shall prioritize Vedic duty compliance frameworks. The threshold of responsibility lies in svadharma observance. Hierarchical authority flows from scriptural injunction, not state statute. Adjudication must restore ritual and social balance rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that neglect of pañcayajña disrupts cosmic秩序. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that omission manifests as societal disorder.

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores divine order through conscious duty enactment.
