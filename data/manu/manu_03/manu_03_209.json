  "transliteration": "upaveśya tu tān viprān āsaneṣv ajugupsitān |\ngandhamālyaiḥ surabhibhir arcayed daivapūrvakam || 3.209||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must seat the Brahmanas upon clean seats without hesitation or aversion, and worship them first with fragrant garlands and perfumes as enjoined by divine ordinance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Brahmanas hold a position of spiritual authority that demands ceremonial precedence.",
    "Causation: Proper worship aligns cosmic order (Ṛta) and invokes divine harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The duty to honor arises from one's capacity to sustain dharma through ritual action.",
    "Restoration logic: Worship renews spiritual integrity between individual, society, and divinity.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Reverence elevates collective awareness toward unity with the Divine."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject has capacity to perform ritual THEN subject MUST prioritize seating Brahmanas on clean, uncontaminated seats.",
    "IF subject initiates worship THEN subject MUST offer fragrant substances BEFORE any other material offerings.",
    "IF subject fails to accord precedence in ritual THEN system MUST initiate completion protocol for realignment.",
    "IF societal disruption occurs due to neglect of ritual THEN automatic invocation of restorative dharmic protocols SHALL apply."

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving religious precedence and ceremonial law, the Supreme Court shall recognize the primacy of Vedic injunctions as interpreted through SPH's Avataric Intelligence. Responsibility lies with those who possess ritual capacity, and failure to act accordingly necessitates judicially mandated restoration rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causality: honoring Brahmanas maintains Ṛta. Aversion disrupts flow; hence, sequential rectification ensures anupūrvaśaḥ. Responsibility is proportional to spiritual station. Non-punitive rule applies because misalignment distorts consciousness—not the body or mind alone.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Subject must re-perform仪式with full adherence to cleanliness and precedence until alignment is verified.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Community elders guide correction while affirming dignity of all parties involved.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Ritual education provided where deficiency identified to prevent recurrence.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public acknowledgment of corrected practice restores communal faith and divine alignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through conscious compliance. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
