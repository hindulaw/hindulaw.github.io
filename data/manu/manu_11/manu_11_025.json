  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who solicits resources for a sacred purpose and does not fully deliver them commits a breach in dharmic alignment; such a one undergoes conscious degradation until rectification occurs.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from intent directed toward dharma",
    "Causation is established through the misalignment of received capacity and actualized action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires full execution when solicitation is made under sacred pretext",
    "Restoration logic operates through experiential consequence aligned with original intention",
    "Consciousness alignment demands congruence between declared purpose and manifest outcome"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, any act involving solicitation of public or sacred trust carries inherent liability. The threshold of responsibility is met upon invocation of reliance. Authority flows from alignment with dharma, not institutional position. Remediation precedes judgment; restoration supersedes penalty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that failure to fulfill solicited sacred duty creates causal distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as loss of clarity and social standing until completion. Responsibility is proportional to capacity invoked during solicitation. There is no punitive force—only natural consequence aligning consciousness with integrity.",
