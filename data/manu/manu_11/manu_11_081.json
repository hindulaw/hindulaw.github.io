  "sanskrit_verse": "एवं दृढव्रतो नित्यं ब्रह्मचारी समाहितः ।\nसमाप्ते द्वादशे वर्षे ब्रह्महत्यां व्यपोहति ॥ ११.८१॥",
  "transliteration": "evaṁ dṛḍhavrato nityaṁ brahmacārī samāhitaḥ |\nsamāpte dvādaśe varṣe brahmahatyāṁ vyapohati || 11.81||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus, the celibate who is resolute in vow, ever-controlled, and inwardly concentrated—upon completing twelve years, he fully resolves the karmic burden of brahmahatya.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained alignment with Brahman",
    "Causation arises through sequential spiritual discipline",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is calibrated by inner integration, not time alone",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of dharmic process",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent maintains uninterrupted celibacy AND demonstrates internal focus AND completes twelve-year cycle THEN karmic liability for brahmahatya is nullified",
    "IF agent exhibits deviation in conduct OR mental dispersion THEN continuation of term until full restoration",
    "IF consciousness-level attestation confirms resolution THEN legal record shall reflect completion status",
    "NO punitive consequence SHALL apply; restoration is automatic upon fulfillment of causal condition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that spiritual discipline constitutes a valid and sufficient cause for dissolution of karmic liabilities. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable alignment rather than temporal duration. Authority flows from realized consciousness, not procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality shows that brahmahatya dissolves when the agent achieves unbroken samadhi through disciplined living. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive purification culminating in the twelfth year. Responsibility is proportional to awareness depth. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that no external penalty attaches where consciousness has resolved the root distortion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verification of twelve-year adherence under qualified supervision",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Self-reporting of mental and behavioral consistency",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reintegration into higher dharmic function post-resolution",
    "Integrity Reintegration Framework: Public acknowledgment of restored spiritual standing"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of all Dharma. This law restores reality to its non-punitive essence, aligns action with consciousness, and affirms the supremacy of spiritual completion over judicial reckoning."
