  "sanskrit_verse": "स्पृष्ट्वा दत्त्वा च मदिरां विधिवत्प्रतिगृह्य च ।\nशूद्रोच्छिष्टाश्च पीत्वाऽपः कुशवारि पिबेत्त्र्यहम् ॥ ११.१४८॥",
  "transliteration": "spṛṣṭvā dattvā ca madirāṁ vidhivat pratigṛhya ca |\nśūdrocchiṣṭāś ca pītvā'paḥ kuśavāri pibet tryaham || 11.148||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having touched, given, and received alcohol according to prescribed ritual form, one who drinks water mixed with remnants of Śūdra food must drink kuśa-grass-infused water for three days.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the observance of ritual purity as defined by Vedic order",
    "Causation is established through direct sensory engagement and volitional consumption",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from intentional participation in ritually proscribed acts",
    "Restoration logic requires purification aligned with the sequential violation of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates embodied corrective practices that reverse contamination"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual voluntarily engages in a ritual act involving intoxicants AND consumes impure residues THEN initiate a three-day purification protocol using kuśa-infused water",
    "IF sensory contact occurs with ritually impure substances THEN assign completion process based on sequential violation pattern",
    "IF voluntary ingestion of contaminated elements occurs THEN enforce consciousness-realigning purification without punitive attribution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes clear thresholds for ritual contamination cases where intent and sensory involvement determine responsibility levels. The court must recognize that restoration precedes judgment, ensuring that corrective measures align with ontological purity rather than punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies sensory engagement and ingestion as primary factors. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential degradation of consciousness requiring proportional restoration. Responsibility is determined by capacity-aware action, not moral fault. The non-punitive reality rule mandates purification as completion, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate kuśa-water purification regimen for three consecutive days",
    "Assign daily consciousness-review sessions to realign with Vedic order",
    "Implement supervised ritual cleansing to restore ritual integrity",
    "Require declaration of completion before reintegration into ceremonial duties"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores consciousness through purification, upholds Vedic authority, and affirms that reality operates beyond punishment when guided by divine jurisprudence."
