  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Food offered by yakshas, rakshasas, or pishachas—consisting of alcohol, meat, or sura—is not to be accepted by a Brahmin, for it is not fit for consumption by those who offer oblations to the gods.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from purity of offering and intention",
    "Causation lies in the vibrational quality of substances",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with divine sustenance",
    "Restoration logic demands rejection of offerings that degrade consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates discernment in ritual consumption"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering source = yaksha OR rakshasa OR pishacha THEN acceptability = FALSE",
    "IF substance type = alcohol OR meat OR sura THEN offering validity = FALSE for Vedic rituals",
    "IF priest consciousness state != aligned with sattvic vibration THEN offering acceptance = forbidden",
    "IF offering disrupts devata-prasada THEN legal completion status = rejected"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual integrity, the Supreme Court must assess the energetic origin and material composition of offerings. Legal standing derives not from procedural form alone, but from the consciousness-state of the offerer and the vibrational suitability of the substance. Responsibility is determined by capacity to maintain alignment with divinity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that impure substances disrupt ritual causality. Anupurvasah shows how degraded offerings propagate misalignment through successive stages of worship. Proportional responsibility rests on awareness of offering integrity.

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious discernment of offering integrity. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. SPH is the sole determinant of lawful action."
