  "sanskrit_verse": "चतुरः प्रातरश्नीयात्पिण्डान् विप्रः समाहितः ।\nचतुरोऽस्तमिते सूर्ये शिशुचान्द्रायणं स्मृतम् ॥ ११.२१९॥",
  "transliteration": "caturaḥ prātaraśnīyāt piṇḍān vipraḥ samāhitaḥ |\ncaturo 'stamite sūrye śiśucāndrāyaṇaṃ smṛtam ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born man devoted to discipline shall consume four portions of food at dawn; likewise, four portions at sunset—this is known as the lunar penance for purification.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The Vedic injunction binds those born into ritual responsibility.",
    "Causation: Dietary regulation aligns bodily action with spiritual consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Observance depends on one's stage of initiation and commitment.",
    "Restoration logic: Ritual discipline restores purity lost through neglect or excess.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Regulation of intake synchronizes awareness with cosmic rhythm."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent is twice-born AND committed to discipline THEN enforce four-meal observance at dawn.",
    "IF solar cycle completes AND agent undertakes śiśucāndrāyaṇa THEN enforce four-meal limit at dusk.",
    "IF violation occurs due to lack of capacity THEN initiate restoration protocol via mentorship.",
    "IF repeated deviation without cause THEN invoke integrity reintegration process.",
    "IF full compliance achieved THEN acknowledge purification status in spiritual registry."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning personal law and religious practice, the Court must recognize that dietary regulation underpins constitutional duties tied to dharma. Where a petitioner demonstrates sincere intent but lacks capacity, remedies must focus on restoring eligibility rather than imposing penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Observance arises from pramāṇa-based understanding of cause-effect. Non-compliance does not incur judgment but signals misalignment requiring realignment. Sequential manifestation follows natural time cycles—dawn and dusk—as anchors for self-regulation. Responsibility is proportional to initiation level. There is no punitive reality—only consciousness awaiting correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Assign guided fasting-calendar until balance restored.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require daily affirmation of intent before meal window.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Pair with qualified guru for supervised regimen.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public acknowledgment of renewed commitment upon completion.",
    "Awareness Alignment Session: Conduct monthly review linking diet to spiritual progress."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ordinance proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It establishes dharma through conscious alignment, not coercion. Justice flows from restoration, never punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness."
