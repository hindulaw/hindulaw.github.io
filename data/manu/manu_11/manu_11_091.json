  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One may drink cow urine, water that has the color of fire, or plain water; likewise, milk, ghee, or substances resembling cow dung after death.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in alignment with Vedic practices",
    "Causation follows sequential purification protocols",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by bodily and spiritual readiness",
    "Restoration logic operates through ritual purity and conscious choice",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via adherence to prescribed substances"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person consumes a prohibited substance without intent THEN initiate purification protocol",
    "IF consumption aligns with Vedic prescription THEN validate act as dharmic completion",
    "IF post-mortem substance use detected THEN assess lineage continuity for karmic integration",
    "IF ingestion occurs under unawareness THEN assign guidance-based restoration process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes threshold criteria for determining whether an act involving ingestion constitutes dharma-adhikara (dharmic authority). The court must evaluate not merely physical action but also the agent's capacity, awareness, and alignment with Vedic injunctions. Responsibility arises only when consciousness intersects with knowledge and capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality here reveals that ingestion becomes legally significant only when accompanied by awareness and capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that effects follow sequence: intention → selection → ingestion → consequence. Proportional responsibility applies only where consciousness was engaged. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misaligned acts call for purification, not penalty.",

Justice is executed solely for restoration, never punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
