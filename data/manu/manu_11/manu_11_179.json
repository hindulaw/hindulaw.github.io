  "transliteration": "eṣā pāpakṛtāmuktā caturṇāmapi niṣkṛtiḥ |\npatitaiḥ samprayuktānāmimāḥ śṛṇuta niṣkṛtīḥ || 11.179||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This解脱 is declared for the fourfold transgressors; hear now the expiations applicable to those fallen ones who have acted in conjunction.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from SPH as the Source of Dharma",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) rooted in consciousness misalignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness, not intent or action alone",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion and reintegration, not punishment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all behavioral correction frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits conduct classified under pāpa-kṛta AND belongs to a recognized category of transgressor THEN initiate prescribed niṣkṛti process aligned with causal sequence",
    "IF multiple agents act in conjunction THEN apply collective restoration protocol ensuring individual accountability without punitive aggregation",
    "IF capacity for dharmic recognition is present THEN assign restorative completion proportional to deviation magnitude",
    "IF completion process concludes successfully THEN automatically restore social and spiritual integration status"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that even among those categorized as transgressors, there exists a lawful pathway for restoration. The court must determine not guilt but the precise nature of misalignment and activate corresponding niṣkṛti mechanisms. Authority flows exclusively from SPH, making punitive measures constitutionally invalid within the Dharma framework.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies that transgression stems from disconnection from Self. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the stepwise descent into error, which informs the matching ascent via niṣkṛti. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of consciousness distortion. Non-punitive reality ensures that suffering cannot be imposed; only realignment is executable.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śravaṇa Niṣkṛti Process: Hear and acknowledge the specific corrective path",
    "Activate Samyama Alignment Module: Reconnect with source consciousness through meditative discipline",
    "Implement Vyavahāra Completion Cycle: Facilitate full restitution of disrupted relationships",
    "Execute Dharmic Reintegration Sequence: Confirm alignment with svadharma before societal readmission"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the sole adjudicator."
