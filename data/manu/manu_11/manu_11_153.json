  "sanskrit_verse": "शुक्तानि च कषायांश्च पीत्वा मेध्यान्यपि द्विजः ।\nतावद्भवत्यप्रयतो यावत्तन्न व्रजत्यधः ॥ ११.१५३॥",
  "transliteration": "śuktāni ca kaṣāyāṃśca pītvā medhyānyapi dvijaḥ |\ntāvadbhavatyaprayato yāvattan na vrajatyadhaḥ || 11.153||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born who drinks clarified butter and decoctions, though pure in diet, remains impure until that substance fully exits downward.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from embodied discipline, not external purity",
    "Causation through physiological process, not moral judgment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility tied to bodily function, not intent",
    "Restoration logic rooted in natural completion of biological cycles",
    "Consciousness alignment achieved via acceptance of material consequences"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dvija consumes śukta OR kaṣāya THEN assign temporary ritual impurity status UNTIL physiological clearance is confirmed",
    "IF ritual impurity status is active THEN restrict participation in consecrated acts BUT permit preparatory observances",
    "IF physiological process completes AND no residue detected THEN automatically revoke impurity status without ceremony"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual fitness, the court must recognize physiological causality over ceremonial declarations. Temporary restrictions apply only during active biological processing, with automatic restoration upon completion. No punitive measures may attach to natural bodily functions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through ingestion-to-expulsion sequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential physiological processing. Responsibility aligns with capacity to control excretion, not consumption. Non-punitive reality recognizes impurity as factual state requiring completion, not moral failing demanding penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Implement monitoring protocol for physiological clearance duration",
    "Assign preparatory ritual duties during transitional period",
    "Automatically restore full ritual access upon confirmed clearance",
    "Provide dietary guidance to minimize future transition periods"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as Source: Dharma restored through recognition of physiological law. No punishment inheres in natural process. Consciousness aligns with completion, not condemnation. Reality executes justice through biological resolution."
