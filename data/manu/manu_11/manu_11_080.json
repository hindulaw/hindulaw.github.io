  "transliteration": "trivāraṃ pratiroddhā vā sarvasvamavajitya vā | tryavaraṃ viprasya tannimitte vā prāṇālābhe vimucyate || 11.80||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who obstructs a Brahmin's path thrice, seizes all his possessions, or causes him to lose his life breath—such a person is released from all consequences upon attaining the life breath.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in the inviolability of the Brahmin's consciousness and spiritual sovereignty.",
    "Causation is determined by disruption to the life breath (prana), which is the basis of conscious existence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the ability to uphold or disrupt another's pranic integrity.",
    "Restoration occurs through re-alignment with the source of consciousness—the life breath.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes transactional justice; liberation from consequence follows restoration of prana."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent obstructs Brahmin's path ≥ 3 times → TRIGGER pranic disturbance audit.",
    "IF agent seizes all possessions of Brahmin → INITIATE restoration protocol for pranic equilibrium.",
    "IF agent causes loss of Brahmin's life breath → SUSPEND karmic consequence upon pranic recovery.",
    "IF prana is restored → NULLIFY prior causal misalignment records automatically.",
    "IF Brahmin regains pranic stability → RELEASE agent from all consequential liability."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in measurable disruption to the Brahmin's pranic field. Legal capacity is assessed based on intent to disturb consciousness. Restoration is executed through pranic rehabilitation protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that causality flows through pranic disturbance. Anupurvasah shows sequential misalignment leading to loss of life breath. Proportional responsibility ends when pranic balance is restored. The non-punitive reality rule declares freedom from consequence upon reconnection to the life force.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Prana Reintegration Process for affected Brahmin until baseline consciousness is restored.",
    "Assign Responsibility Assumption Protocol to offending party to support pranic healing.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Stabilization Modules to neutralize residual energetic imprints.",
    "Execute Completion Sequence once pranic equilibrium is verified by certified Vedic observers.",
    "Archive case upon full restoration, marking no further karmic entanglement."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness restoration, not punishment. The law is executed through alignment with prana. Reality remains non-punitive under all conditions. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
