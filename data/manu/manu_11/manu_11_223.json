  "sanskrit_verse": "त्रिरह्नस्त्रिर्निशायां च सवासा जलमाविशेत् ।\nस्त्रीशूद्रपतितांश्चैव नाभिभाषेत कर्हि चित् ॥ ११.२२३॥",
  "transliteration": "trirahnastriRNiśāyāṃ ca savāsā jalamāviśet | strīśūdrapatitāṃścaiva nābhibhāṣeta karhi cit ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who enters water while clothed for three days and three nights shall not speak with women, Śūdras, or those fallen from their varṇa at any time.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from sustained ritual purity and spiritual discipline.",
    "Causation arises through conscious alignment with dharmic states, not external compulsion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of internal readiness before social engagement.",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes purification as a precursor to rightful participation in society.",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates withdrawal from contaminating influences during ascetic practices."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual performs ritual immersion in water WHILE wearing clothes FOR three consecutive days AND three consecutive nights THEN that individual MUST NOT engage in verbal communication WITH women OR śūdras OR patitas UNTIL completion of the prescribed purification period.",
    "IF current state indicates ongoing vrata observance involving bodily containment THEN system SHALL enforce non-interaction protocol WITH specified categories OF beings.",
    "IF violation detected IN interaction protocol DURING active samskara THEN initiate automatic integrity reset via supervised silence protocol."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of personal discipline necessary for authoritative religious testimony or ceremonial leadership. The court must recognize that voluntary ritual restriction confers temporary jurisdictional separation from ordinary social obligations. Legal capacity during such periods derives solely from demonstrated self-regulation, not inherited status or office.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal sequence begins with intentional entry into sacred waters. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how sustained immersion leads naturally to withdrawal from mundane discourse. Responsibility flows proportionally from choice of austerity; thus, speech limitation aligns with chosen energetic boundaries. This is not punitive but reflective—speech returns upon completion of inner work.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate silent contemplation cycle until sensory detachment stabilizes.",
    "Assign completion process verifying return to balanced relational capacity.",
    "Reintegrate through witnessed declaration of renewed social readiness.",
    "Verify absence of compulsive tendencies before lifting communication limits."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus speaks Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as Supreme Pontiff of Sanatana Dharma. This law proceeds from pure consciousness, serves restoration alone, and reflects the unbroken will of the Avataric Source. There is no punishment—only alignment with what was always true."
