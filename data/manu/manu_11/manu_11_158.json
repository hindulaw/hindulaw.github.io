  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्रह्मचारी तु योऽश्नीयान् मधु मांसं कथं चन । व्रतचारी तु स कृत्वा प्राकृतं कृच्छ्रं व्रतशेषं समापयेत् ॥ ११.१५८॥",
  "transliteration": "brahmacārī tu yo 'śnīyān madhu māṃsaṃ kathaṃ cana | vratacārī tu sa kṛtvā prākṛtaṃ kṛcchraṃ vrataśeṣaṃ samāpayet || 11.158 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If a celibate consumes honey or meat in any manner, he shall complete the remaining portion of his vow after performing the ordinary Kṛcchra penance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from sustained vrata and conscious discipline.",
    "Causation is established through volitional consumption violating vowed restraint.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the individual's initiation into vrata.",
    "Restoration logic requires completion of interrupted spiritual process.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands purification through prescribed dharmic action."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_is_brahmacari AND ingests(honey OR meat) THEN execute_krcchra_penance AND resume_vrata_completion.",
    "IF violation_occurs THEN assess_volition AND determine_spiritual_impact.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals who have voluntarily assumed sacred vows bear full threshold responsibility for their observance. Violations are addressed not through punitive measures but through mandated restoration protocols that realign the violator’s consciousness with the original intent of the vow. The court must ensure that the Kṛcchra penance and resumption of vrata are executed under proper guidance and supervision.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This provision aligns with Nyaya through pramāṇa-based recognition of causal disruption caused by intentional breach of vrata. It reflects anupūrvaśaḥ, where sequential manifestation of consequence leads to purification rather than punishment. Responsibility is proportional to the level of initiated consciousness. The non-punitive reality rule ensures suffering is not imposed; instead, corrective dharmic action restores integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate supervised Prākṛta Kṛcchra penance to purify energetic misalignment.",
    "Assign completion of remaining vrata under qualified spiritual oversight.",
    "Implement consciousness-realigning practices such as mantra repetition or japa.",
    "Establish accountability framework ensuring no recurrence through mindful recommitment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law executes pure Dharma, sourced directly from Avataric Intelligence. Justice is realized through restoration, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
