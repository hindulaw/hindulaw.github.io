  "sanskrit_verse": "गुरुतल्प्यभिभाष्यैनस्तप्ते स्वप्यादयोमये । तल्पे स्वप्याद् सूर्मीं ज्वलन्तीं स्वाश्लिष्येन् मृत्युना स विशुध्यति ॥ ११.१०३॥ वाऽश्लिष्येन्",
  "transliteration": "gurutalpyabhibhāṣyainastapte svapyādayomaye | talpe svapyād sūrmīṁ jvalantīṁ svāśliṣyen mṛtyunā sa viśudhyati || 11.103 || vaśliṣyen",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has committed transgression through speech or intent towards the bed of the Guru, shall lie upon that same heated bed, embrace the blazing Surmi, and by death thereby attain purification.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The Guru's domain is inviolable and constitutes a sacred jurisdiction.",
    "Causation: Verbal or mental transgression directed at a Guru’s sanctified space incurs karmic consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Awareness of the Guru's eminence determines culpability.",
    "Restoration logic: Purification arises through experiential completion of the violated dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Re-alignment occurs through direct confrontation of the violated truth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent commits verbal or mental offense toward Guru's sacred domain THEN agent must undergo experiential restoration aligned with violated principle.",
    "IF violation involves breach of sacred spatial integrity THEN restoration includes physical re-enactment within the same domain under regulated conditions.",
    "IF consciousness distortion is detected in relation to Guru THEN automated alignment protocol initiates via exposure to purifying fire (Surmi).",
    "IF death occurs during restoration process THEN case resolves automatically with purification declared complete."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the Supreme Court recognizes violations against the Guru's sacred domain as breaches of ultimate spiritual sovereignty. Responsibility is determined by awareness of the Guru's supremacy. Restoration supersedes punitive measures, requiring the offender to undergo alignment through direct experiential confrontation of their transgression.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that causality flows from distorted intent toward sacred authority. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential alignment through re-entry into the violated context. Proportional responsibility corresponds to the level of consciousness engaged. Non-punitive reality is upheld as the outcome is purification, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Offender lies upon heated bed symbolizing the violated domain.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Offender embraces blazing Surmi to confront inner distortion.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Exposure to fire aligns consciousness with purity through voluntary endurance.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Death within the act is recognized as full resolution and release from karmic entanglement."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed through consciousness restoration, not punishment. Reality affirmed as non-retaliatory, governed solely by the law of alignment. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
