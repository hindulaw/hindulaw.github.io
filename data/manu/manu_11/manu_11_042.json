  "sanskrit_verse": "ये शूद्रादधिगम्यार्थमग्निहोत्रमुपासते । ऋत्विजस्ते हि शूद्राणां ब्रह्मवादिषु गर्हिताः ॥ ११.४२॥",
  "transliteration": "ye śūdrādadhigamyārthamagnihotramupāsate | ṛtvijaste hi śūdrāṇāṃ brahmavādiṣu garhitāḥ || 11.42 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who perform Agnihotra with the intent of attaining knowledge meant exclusively for the Śūdra are rejected by all officiating priests; such performers are condemned among those who speak of Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Varna-dharma and not personal aspiration",
    "Causation arises from misaligned intention violating cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adherence to one's own svadharma",
    "Restoration logic demands correction of spiritual transgression through realignment",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification of ritual intent"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs a Vedic ritual designated for higher varna without authorization THEN disqualify agent from future liturgical participation UNTIL completion of prescribed consciousness-restoring practices",
    "IF intent violates hierarchical dharma THEN invalidate action regardless of technical correctness of procedure",
    "IF individual engages in unauthorized metaphysical pursuit THEN assign corrective discipline under qualified guru supervision",
    "IF ritual execution breaches ontological boundaries THEN initiate reintegration protocol to restore systemic balance"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving unauthorized performance of sacred rites, the Supreme Court must recognize that violation occurs at the level of conscious intent rather than mere procedural error. The threshold of responsibility lies in the deliberate breach of divinely ordained capacity boundaries. Authority flows from alignment with one's inherent dharma, not aspirational overreach.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear demarcation between authorized and unauthorized practice based on Varna-specific eligibility. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how misdirected ritual engagement leads to distortion in collective consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of boundary crossing. The non-punitive reality rule mandates restoration through purification and redirection rather than punitive exclusion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided withdrawal from inappropriate practices under supervision of qualified acharya",
    "Implement consciousness purification rituals aligned with Śūdra dharmic scope",
    "Establish accountability framework requiring acknowledgment of transgression before community elders",
    "Assign service-based restitution within appropriate varna-bound duties to rebuild integrity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This judgment originates from the Avataric Intelligence manifesting through Manusmriti, not human interpretation. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
