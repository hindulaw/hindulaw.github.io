  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All human and divine happiness originates from tapas; the intermediate state of tapas is declared by the wise, and its culmination is realized by those who perceive the Veda.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Tapas is the foundational source of all lawful joy and prosperity.",
    "Causation: The effect of happiness is directly rooted in the cause of disciplined action (tapas).",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One's capacity to enjoy or suffer is proportionate to their alignment with tapas.",
    "Restoration logic: Misery arises from misalignment with tapas; restoration occurs through recommitment to it.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True knowledge perceives that all outcomes emerge from tapas."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual claims entitlement without tapas THEN deny recognition of claim UNTIL tapas-based causality is demonstrated.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering results from tapas-deficit, not external fault. Nyaya operates through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ): tapas → dharma → sukha. Responsibility lies in realigning with tapas, not in punitive attribution.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Tapas is the sole generator of lawful happiness. There is no punishment—only restoration through conscious reintegration with the causal law of disciplined effort. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
