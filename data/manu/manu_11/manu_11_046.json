  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Actions performed without desire are purified through the practice of Vedic knowledge; actions performed out of desire and delusion are cleansed through differentiated Prayaschitta protocols.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness clarity, not intent distortion",
    "Causation is traced to volitional ignorance or enlightened detachment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the presence or absence of desire-induced delusion",
    "Restoration logic aligns action with Vedic alignment, not punitive consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through differentiated purification pathways"

    "IF action_intent = 'desireless' AND action_impact ≠ 'malicious' THEN purification_method = 'Vedic study and recitation'",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the actor's state of consciousness at the time of action. Actions rooted in non-desire are subject to Vedic rehabilitation rather than judicial penalty. Hierarchical authority recognizes that consciousness precedes causality, and thus, higher courts must assess metaphysical alignment prior to applying restorative protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that desireless acts lack karmic impurity. Anupurvasah reveals that delusion-bound actions sequentially manifest due to uncontrolled will. Proportional responsibility is aligned with the depth of delusion and motive. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction arises through conscious completion, not imposed suffering.",

This law restores action to its pure origin, aligns consciousness with Vedic truth, enforces restoration without punishment, and confirms reality as inherently non-punitive, governed solely by the supremacy of awakened awareness."
