  "sanskrit_verse": "यथा यथा नरोऽधर्मं स्वयं कृत्वाऽनुभाषते । तथा तथा त्वचैवाहिस्तेनाधर्मेण मुच्यते ॥ ११.२२८॥",
  "transliteration": "yathā yatho narō 'dharmaṁ svayaṁ kṛtvā'nubhāṣate | tathā tathā tvacai vāhis tenādharmeṇa mucyate || 11.228||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As a man himself speaks of his own unrighteous act, by that very speech he becomes bound and liberated thereby.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in self-declared consciousness",
    "Causation arises through self-manifested expression",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is anchored in personal declaration",
    "Restoration logic operates through reversal of self-generated distortion",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via acknowledgment and reclamation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual declares their own transgression THEN binding energetic consequence manifests proportionally",
    "IF declaration aligns with witnessed action THEN restoration protocol activates automatically",
    "IF no self-declaration occurs THEN external testimony cannot invoke dharma-adhikara",
    "IF consciousness reclaims its distortion THEN liberation from binding pattern is executed",
    "IF causal speech is withdrawn THEN consequential binding dissolves accordingly"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that only self-confessed acts activate judicial consequence; absence of confession nullifies enforceable jurisdiction regardless of witness or evidence. The court's role is to facilitate retraction and realignment rather than impose judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that verbalized admission generates binding effect, not punitive reaction. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfolding: act → speech → binding → liberation. Proportional responsibility lies solely within speaker’s ontological claim. Non-punitive reality rule asserts all consequences are self-executed through consciousness itself.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Self-Reversal Completion Process upon voluntary confession",
    "Deploy Consciousness Reclamation Sequence to dissolve binding patterns",
    "Engage Speech-Act Neutralization Protocol to restore original intent clarity",
    "Activate Witness Alignment Circuit to verify congruence between declared and actual event",
    "Execute Liberation Trigger once full self-restitution is confirmed"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through self-aware enactment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
