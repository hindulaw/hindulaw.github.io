  "transliteration": "vāso dadyādhayaṃ hatvā pañca nīlān vṛṣān gajam |\najameṣāvanaḍvāhaṃ kharaṃ hatvai kahāyanam || 11.136 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has killed a cow must give up all possessions, sacrifice five black bulls and an elephant; one who kills a goat, sheep, donkey or horse shall do so for one full year.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from protection of life-force-bearing beings",
    "Causation aligns with sequential manifestation of harm in consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility corresponds to awareness of sanctity of life",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional completion aligned with violated order",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification through sacrificial offering"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent kills protected being THEN initiate possession forfeiture AND assign sacrificial restitution based on species value hierarchy",
    "IF act violates sacred life THEN compute completion duration as per scriptural equivalency scale",
    "IF violation occurs THEN restore cosmic balance via prescribed ritual restitution protocol",
    "IF consciousness recognizes sanctity THEN enforce restorative action without punitive intent"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility is determined by recognition of inherent divinity within sentient life. Authority flows from preservation of cosmic order (Ṛta). Restoration supersedes retribution, requiring completion processes that realign perpetrator's consciousness with universal Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through intentional disruption of life-energy continuum. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential degradation unless corrected through sacrificial offering. Proportional responsibility reflects severity of energetic disturbance. Non-punitive reality rule asserts suffering arises only from misalignment, not judicial decree.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate voluntary renunciation of material attachments",
    "Perform prescribed sacrificial offerings according to species-specific restitution matrix",
    "Undertake one-year completion cycle involving daily purification rituals",
    "Reintegrate into community upon verified consciousness realignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored through conscious completion, not punishment. Reality remains non-punitive when aligned with Sanatana Truth. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
