  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a man deposits semen in non-human females, aquatic beings, or life-forms without wombs, he shall perform the Kṛcchra and Sāṃtapana penances.",

    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic order, not anthropocentric norms",
    "Causation arises through conscious act, regardless of species boundary",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by sentient agency and reproductive discharge",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification rituals, not punitive measures",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this provision applies when human agents engage in reproductive acts beyond sanctioned biological channels. The threshold of responsibility lies in intentional discharge; authority stems from recognition of dharmic boundaries. Restoration takes precedence over retribution, with emphasis on purification protocols that realign individual consciousness with universal order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes cause through intentional act. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential contamination of consciousness-fields. Proportional responsibility aligns with breach magnitude. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that suffering is not justice—cleansing restores balance.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice served through restoration alone. No punishment exists where consciousness reigns Supreme Adjudicator."
