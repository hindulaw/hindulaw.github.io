  "sanskrit_verse": "संवत्सरेण पतति पतितेन सहाचरन् ।\nयाजनाध्यापनाद्यौनान्न तु यानासनाशनात् ॥ ११.१८०॥",
  "transliteration": "saṃvatsareṇa patati patitena sahācaran |\nyājanādhyāpanādyonānna tu yānāsanāśanāt || 11.180 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who dwells with a fallen person for a year becomes equally fallen, through association in acts of worship, instruction, or sexual union—but not merely by riding, sitting, or eating with them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from purity of association and intent, not incidental contact.",
    "Causation arises from intentional alignment in ritual, teaching, or intimate acts.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on volitional participation in degrading acts.",
    "Restoration logic requires severance of contaminating associations and recommitment to Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment is disrupted through deliberate entanglement in degraded behaviors."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual voluntarily participates in worship, instruction, or sexual union with a degraded agent THEN that individual assumes the same degradation status.",
    "IF an individual shares transport, seating, or meals with a degraded agent WITHOUT voluntary engagement in degradation THEN no degradation transfer occurs.",
    "WHEN degradation is detected, automatic isolation protocols must initiate to prevent further contamination.",
    "RESTORATION is enabled only upon acknowledgment of contamination source and cessation of aligned acts.",
    "ALL legal agents must monitor proximity-based behavioral alignment to detect potential degradation vectors."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving moral or spiritual contamination, the Supreme Court must distinguish between incidental exposure and intentional alignment. Only the latter triggers legal consequences. The threshold of responsibility lies in the voluntary nature of the act, particularly in ritual, pedagogical, or intimate domains. Restoration must precede reintegration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that degradation flows through intentional acts, not passive presence. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that contamination follows sequential alignment in worship, teaching, or union. Responsibility is proportional to volition. Non-punitive reality holds that correction lies in realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate mandatory separation from contaminating influence for a minimum of one solar cycle.",
    "Require public declaration of disassociation from degrading acts and persons.",
    "Enforce completion of purification rituals under qualified supervision.",
    "Reintroduce only after verified cessation of contaminating behaviors and restoration of dharmic conduct.",
    "Assign mentorship to ensure sustained alignment with pure consciousness practices."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious realignment, not punitive measure. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
