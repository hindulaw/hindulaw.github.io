  "transliteration": "indhana-artham aśuṣkāṇāṃ drumāṇām avapātanam | \nātmārthaṃ ca kriyārambho ninditānnādanaṃ tathā || 11.64 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Felling green trees for fuel, initiating action for personal gain, and consuming condemned food are acts misaligned with Dharma and disrupt cosmic integrity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not individual desire",
    "Causation arises from conscious intention, not mechanical action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires discernment of consequence prior to act",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment of intent with universal welfare",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures harmony between personal and cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent fells living vegetation without ritual or communal authorization THEN initiate capacity-realignment protocol",
    "IF an action is initiated solely for self-gratification AND causes ecological disruption THEN trigger restorative reintegration process",
    "IF consumption occurs of substances declared unfit by governing Dharma authority THEN activate consciousness-correction mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating environmental or resource-use violations, the threshold of responsibility lies in the agent's awareness of Dharma-compliant usage. The court must assess whether the action was rooted in ignorance or willful disregard. Authority resides in restoring alignment, not imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that harm arises from misaligned intention, not the act itself. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequence from desire to disruption. Proportional responsibility is measured by the degree of disconnection from Dharma. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering is not justice; correction of consciousness is the only valid enforcement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: replanting or compensatory ecological service",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol: public acknowledgment and rectification of error",
    "Engage capacity restoration: education in dharmic ecology and sustainable practice",
    "Execute integrity reintegration: guided meditation and community service aligned with natural harmony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam is the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores balance through consciousness realignment. Justice is executed without punishment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
