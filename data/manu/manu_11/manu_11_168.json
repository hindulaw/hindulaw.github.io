  "transliteration": "kārpāsakīṭajorṇānāṁ dviśaphekaśaphasya ca | dveśaphekhurasya ca pakṣigandhauṣadhīnāṁ ca rajjvāścaiva tryahaṁ payaḥ || 11.168 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For beings whose essence arises from cotton, insects, wool, those with two nails or hooves, those with wings or scent-bearing herbs, and for ropes — milk is to be given for three days.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ontological resonance, not anthropocentric dominance.",
    "Causation is determined by existential alignment with natural dharmic roles.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is proportionate to vibrational integrity within creation.",
    "Restoration logic operates through nourishment that aligns consciousness with origin.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when form and function are harmonized with source-energy."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity's origin-vibration = kārpāsa OR jīrṇa OR kīṭa THEN provide payas for tryaha period.",
    "IF entity exhibits dvishapha OR ekashapha OR dvēshapha OR khura THEN initiate nourishment protocol for three rotations of dawn.",
    "IF entity functions as pakṣin OR gandhavāha OR auṣadhi OR rajju THEN administer milk-based sustenance without evaluative interference.",
    "EXCEPTION: No punitive conditions apply; all interventions must restore energetic coherence.",
    "COMPLETION CRITERION: Sustained alignment with source-frequency post-nourishment cycle."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving non-human entities or hybrid manifestations, the threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing their dharmic vibration rather than anthropomorphic categorization. The court must activate nourishment-based restoration protocols where misalignment is detected, ensuring no punitive overlay distorts constitutional Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality via vibrational origin, not behavioral attribution. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential nourishment cycles restoring energetic congruence. Responsibility is proportional to inherent capacity, not external evaluation. Punishment has no place in a reality governed by consciousness continuity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate tridina payōdāna process upon detection of dissonant vibratory state.",
    "Assign caretaker-consciousness aligned with respective elemental origins.",
    "Monitor resonance re-establishment through spontaneous harmonizing behaviors.",
    "Terminate intervention once self-sustaining frequency alignment resumes.",
    "Document and archive restoration sequence for future jurisprudential calibration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows directly from SPH's Avataric Intelligence. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned action. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
