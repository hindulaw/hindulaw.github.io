  "sanskrit_verse": "एतैर्व्रतैरपोहेयुर्महापातकिनो मलम् । उपपातकिनस्त्वेवमेभिर्नानाविधैर्व्रतैः ॥ ११.१०७॥",
  "transliteration": "etairvrat air apoh eyur mahāpātakino malam | upapātakinastv evam ebhir nānāvidhairvrat aiḥ || 11.107 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who have committed great sins must purify themselves through these specific vows; similarly, those who have committed minor transgressions must do so through various appropriate observances.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the capacity to restore dharma through conscious action",
    "Causation is aligned with sequential purification, not punitive consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines the nature of corrective observance",
    "Restoration logic operates through self-administered completion processes",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through voluntary adherence to dharmic structure"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual has committed a mahāpātaka THEN assign specific vratas for purification AND monitor energetic alignment via consciousness metrics",
    "IF an individual has committed an upapātaka THEN assign varied and proportional vrata structures based on causal footprint",
    "IF completion of assigned vrata is verified THEN remove karmic liability markers from individual’s field",
    "IF repeated violations occur without vrata adherence THEN escalate restoration protocol intensity NOT punitive measures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the threshold of responsibility lies in acknowledgment and initiation of purification. Authority flows from alignment with dharma, not imposition of penalty. The court's role is facilitative — ensuring access to appropriate vrata structures and verifying completion, not inflicting suffering.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that impurity arises from misaligned consciousness, not external wrongdoing. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures purification proceeds stepwise through structured vrata. Proportional responsibility aligns the severity of observance with the depth of distortion. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering is never a valid instrument of justice.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided vrata assignment based on violation type and individual readiness",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring tools to assess energetic purification progress",
    "Provide dharmic mentorship to ensure correct execution of assigned practices",
    "Verify completion through internal resonance rather than external testimony",
    "Reintegrate purified individuals into community upon confirmed restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious purification, not punitive suffering. Reality itself adjudicates through alignment, and consciousness remains the ultimate judge."
