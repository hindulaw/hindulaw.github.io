  "sanskrit_verse": "देवस्वं ब्राह्मणस्वं वा लोभेनोपहिनस्ति यः ।\nस पापात्मा परे लोके गृध्रौच्छिष्टेन जीवति ॥ ११.२६॥",
  "transliteration": "devasvaṁ brāhmaṇasvaṁ vā lobhenopahinasti yaḥ |\nsa pāpātmā pare loke gṛdhrauucchṣṭena jīvati || 11.26||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, driven by greed, harms property belonging to the divine or to a Brāhmaṇa, that soul in future worlds lives on the vomit of vultures.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not personal desire",
    "Causation arises from conscious intent rooted in greed, not mere action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of sacred ownership structures",
    "Restoration logic demands experiential completion of violated energetic flows",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates karmic mirroring for self-realization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent acts with greed AND targets property designated as divine or Brāhmaṇa-owned THEN initiate consciousness-restoration protocol",
    "IF violation occurs THEN assign karmic mirroring experience proportional to energetic distortion caused",
    "IF capacity for harm is demonstrated THEN disengage from roles involving stewardship until integrity is restored",
    "IF awareness of violation arises THEN activate self-corrective completion process without external enforcement"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, intent rooted in greed constitutes threshold for responsibility when directed toward properties recognized under Dharma as sacred or assigned to those embodying Vedic authority. Restoration supersedes punitive measures through experiential recalibration aligned with cosmic justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality via greed-driven intent; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through mirrored degradation reflecting the violated purity. Responsibility is proportional to the disruption of sanctified order. The consequence is not imposed but inherently unfolds as part of the act's completion, serving realignment rather than punishment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate karmic mirroring protocol wherein violator experiences degradation equivalent to desecrated purity",
    "Engage completion cycle ensuring full assimilation of violated energy back into harmonious flow",
    "Activate consciousness-receptivity training to restore capacity for recognizing sacred boundaries",
    "Implement withdrawal from positions of influence until integrity reconstruction is verified"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned consequence. There is no punishment—only the natural unfolding of cause-effect for self-recognition and spiritual reintegration. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness itself is the ultimate Judge."
