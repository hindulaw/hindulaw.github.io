  "sanskrit_verse": "सावित्रीं च जपेन्नित्यं पवित्राणि च शक्तितः ।\nसर्वेष्वेव व्रतेष्वेवं प्रायश्चित्तार्थमादृतः ॥ ११.२२५॥",
  "transliteration": "sāvitrīṁ ca japennityaṁ pavitrāṇi ca śaktitaḥ |\nsarveṣveva vratesvevaṁ prāyaścittārthamādṛtaḥ || 11.225 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must daily recite the Savitri and purifying mantras with full capacity, in all vows undertaken, specifically for the purpose of Prayaschitta.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from sustained alignment with Vedic vibration through disciplined utterance.",
    "Causation arises from conscious repetition of sacred sound as a restorative energetic act.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires invocation of inherent spiritual strength in ritual performance.",
    "Restoration logic operates through vibrational purification that resets karmic misalignment.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when speech, intent, and action resonate with revealed truth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual undertakes any vow THEN they MUST perform daily Savitri recitation AND associated purifying chants.",
    "IF Prayaschitta is required THEN the agent's capacity to vibrate sacred sound SHALL be assessed and activated.",
    "IF any vrata is performed THEN adherence to Savitri-based purification SHALL be automatically enforced by consciousness-monitoring systems.",
    "IF misalignment is detected THEN automated protocols SHALL prescribe Savitri repetition until energetic equilibrium is restored.",
    "IF dharma-adhikari observes incomplete vrata THEN initiate Savitri reinforcement protocol WITHOUT punitive attribution."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying whether the accused maintained Savitri-based purification during vrata observance. Authority hierarchy recognizes those whose consciousness remains aligned with Vedic utterance. Restoration supersedes retribution by mandating completion of sacred recitation rather than imposing external penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana is established through measurable resonance of correct pronunciation and sustained repetition. Anupurvasah manifests as sequential purification of causal layers through mantra vibration. Responsibility is proportional to one's retained capacity for accurate japa. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment dissolves upon completion of prescribed vibratory restoration.",

    "Initiate Savitri Completion Process wherein individual repeats Gayatri until spontaneous clarity arises.",
    "Deploy Shakti Activation Protocol to restore innate ability to pronounce sacred syllables correctly.",
    "Assign Purification Mantra Integration until energetic cleanliness is confirmed by monitoring systems.",
    "Execute Consciousness Re-alignment Sequence through guided Savitri meditation cycles.",
    "Undertake Vrata Integrity Restoration via supervised daily chanting sessions until self-regulation resumes."

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through Savitri's power. Reality acknowledges no punishment. Consciousness alone judges. Let it be done."
