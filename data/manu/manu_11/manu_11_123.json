  "transliteration": "tebhyo labdhena bhaikṣeṇa vartayann ekakālikam | upaspṛśaṁstriṣavaṇaṁ tvabdene sa viśudhyati || 11.123 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who sustains oneself solely by alms obtained from the consecrated twice-born and maintains discipline through daily purification rituals—specifically by touching water thrice daily for one year—becomes purified.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in disciplined alignment with sacred order",
    "Causation arises through sustained ritual conduct and renunciatory practice",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by adherence to prescribed purification protocols",
    "Restoration logic operates via sequential completion of purificatory actions",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through disciplined sensory regulation and ritual purity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs unauthorized act THEN initiate purification protocol requiring alms-dependent livelihood for minimum one-year duration",
    "IF purification protocol initiated THEN enforce tri-daily ablution regimen without exception",
    "IF agent completes one full solar cycle of prescribed ablutions THEN automatically restore eligibility status within governing framework",
    "IF agent fails to maintain alms-only sustenance during purification period THEN reset purification timeline from point of deviation",
    "IF agent demonstrates willful neglect of ablution schedule THEN invoke consciousness-realignment process under qualified supervision"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this provision establishes that restoration of lawful standing follows precise observance of a twelve-month purification cycle involving regulated subsistence and ritual cleansing. The threshold of responsibility lies in intentional compliance rather than punitive accountability. Authority flows from completion of prescribed action sequences, not judicial imposition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that purity emerges exclusively through correct sequence of acts: alms-reliance + tri-daily ablution + full annual cycle = restoration. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures no step may be bypassed. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for sustained ritual discipline. No punitive inference applies; reality itself enforces outcome upon correct execution.",

    "Initiate Alms-Based Livelihood Monitoring Protocol",
    "Deploy Tri-Daily Ablution Compliance Tracker",
    "Assign Purification Timeline Validation Mechanism",

    "Execute Post-Cycle Status Reintegration Procedure"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Purity arises through disciplined action, not judgment. Reality aligns consciousness directly when causal conditions are fulfilled. No punishment exists where completion restores integrity."
