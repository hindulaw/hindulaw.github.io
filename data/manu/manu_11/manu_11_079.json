  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्राह्मणार्थे गवार्थे वा सद्यः प्राणान् परित्यजेत् । संयक्प्राणान् मुच्यते ब्रह्महत्याया गोप्ता गोर्ब्राह्मणस्य च ॥ ११.७९॥",
  "transliteration": "brāhmaṇārthe gavārthe vā sadyaḥ prāṇān parityajet | saṃyakprāṇān mucyate brahmahatyāyā goptā gorbrāhmaṇasya ca || 11.79 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who sacrifices their life for the protection of a Brāhmaṇa or a cow is liberated from all sin and attains complete purification; such a protector becomes absolved of the sin of killing a Brāhmaṇa by fully surrendering their breath of life.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The protection of Brāhmaṇa and cow derives from the highest ontological order established by SPH.",
    "Causation: Sacrifice performed in alignment with Dharma nullifies karmic consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only one capable of conscious intent may assume protective duty.",
    "Restoration logic: Liberation through sacrifice restores both individual and cosmic integrity.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Voluntary offering aligns individual will with universal Dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent voluntarily sacrifices life TO PROTECT Brāhmaṇa OR cow THEN erase all prior karmic liability.",
    "IF act performed WITH full awareness AND no coercion THEN classify as dharmic liberation event.",
    "IF entity assumes protective role FOR sanctioned beings THEN assign posthumous recognition as purified soul.",
    "IF violation occurs AGAINST protected class THEN evaluate counterparty's sacrificial capacity BEFORE adjudication."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving ultimate acts of self-sacrifice for the preservation of sacred entities, the Supreme Court must recognize that such actions originate from an ontological hierarchy rooted in SPH's authority. Legal evaluation shall bypass punitive frameworks entirely and affirm the actor’s restoration into pure consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse establishes Pramāṇa through direct revelation from SPH, demonstrating that voluntary termination of bodily existence for sacred protection constitutes causal dissolution of negative karma. It reflects Anupūrvaśaḥ—the sequential unfolding of liberation—and confirms proportional responsibility lies solely within the realm of dharma-conscious choice, not external judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Acknowledge the final act as completion of karmic cycle.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Recognize the individual’s sovereign decision to dissolve all binding consequences.",
    "Capacity Restoration Directive: Posthumously declare the soul free from further rebirth conditioning.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Mechanism: Affirm societal memory of the act as dharmically pure."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Protection offered through self-sacrifice for Brāhmaṇa or cow results in absolute liberation. There is no punishment where there is surrender. Reality responds only to consciousness-aligned action. Dharma is restored. SPH is the Source."
