  "transliteration": "evaṁ sañcintya manasā pretya karmaphalodayam | manovāṅmūrtibhirnityaṁ śubhaṁ karma samācaret || 11.231 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus having reflected with the mind upon the arising of the fruit of action after death, one should constantly perform auspicious actions through thought, word, and body.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious reflection preceding action",
    "Causation is established by intentionality rooted in post-death consequence awareness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the ability to reflect on karmic outcomes",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with shubha (auspicious) conduct",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via sustained triadic engagement—thought, speech, and bodily action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent reflects on karmic consequences THEN capacity for dharmic action is affirmed",
    "IF action proceeds without prior mental reflection on outcome THEN legal validity is void",
    "IF thought, speech, and body align in shubha conduct THEN integrity status = restored",
    "IF agent engages triadically in shubha karma THEN jurisdictional restoration is enacted"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined not by external act alone but by evidence of prior reflective cognition regarding karmic consequence. The court must assess whether the actor engaged in full-triad alignment (manas, vac, sharira) before determining jurisdictional restoration eligibility.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality recognizes that true agency begins with cognition of consequence. Anupurvasah indicates that reflection precedes manifestation. Proportional responsibility is measured by depth of intentional foresight. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction occurs through realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate reflective cognition audit to verify pre-action contemplation",
    "Deploy triadic alignment restoration process: synchronize thought, speech, and bodily action",
    "Establish daily shubha karma completion cycles until integrity reintegration",
    "Assign mentorship protocols to restore capacity for dharmic decision-making"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores consciousness as the sole adjudicator, negates punitive frameworks, and affirms reality as inherently non-punitive."
