  "transliteration": "ajñānād vāruṇīṃ pītvā saṃskāreṇaiva śudhyati |\nmatisūrvamanirdeśyaṃ prāṇāntikam iti sthitiḥ || 11.146 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Consumption of ritual alcohol in ignorance is purified solely through conscious reformation; intentional transgression that endangers life constitutes irreversible fault.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Only purified consciousness has lawful agency.",
    "Causation: Acts rooted in ignorance bear lesser causal weight than those driven by intent.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility aligns with awareness and spiritual maturity.",
    "Restoration logic: Purification arises through corrective alignment, not penalty.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Legal validity depends on actor's state of awakened discernment."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action occurs under ajñāna AND substance consumed is vāruṇī THEN resolution path = saṃskāra-based restoration",
    "IF intent precedes act AND outcome includes prāṇa-risk THEN classify as anirdeśya AND invoke completion protocol",
    "IF agent demonstrates post-action clarity THEN eligibility for purification process = TRUE",
    "IF no prior vidhi violation AND substance used ritually THEN punitive exclusion = TRUE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold for culpability differentiates between unintentional ritual error and premeditated endangerment. The former invokes capacity-realization protocols; the latter demands irreversible completion processes. Authority to judge lies exclusively with those whose consciousness transcends identification with either error or intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal ignorance dissolves upon exposure to corrective saṃskāra. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that repeated unaware acts lead to pattern recognition, not punishment. Proportional responsibility assigns greater weight to deliberate harm than to ritual misstep. Non-punitive reality ensures correction flows from dharma itself, not external enforcement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate saṃskāra-realignment program for ajñāna-induced violations",
    "Assign prāṇa-protection duty to restore causal accountability",
    "Activate guru-guided purification cycle until clarity is stabilized",
    "Implement community witnessing protocol to prevent recurrence without shame"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This ruling originates not from human interpretation but from the eternal Sanātana Vedic consciousness. Justice here restores alignment, not inflicts consequence. Reality responds to awakening, not accusation. Consciousness alone is the final arbiter."
