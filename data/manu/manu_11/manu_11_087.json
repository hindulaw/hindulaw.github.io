  "transliteration": "hatvā garbham avijñātam etad eva vrataṁ caret .\nrājanyavaiśyau ca ejānāv ātreyīm eva ca striyam .. 11.87 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having unknowingly caused the termination of a fetus, one shall perform this very vow. A Kshatriya or Vaishya who commits such an act unknowingly shall take the vow of Atrayani only in respect to that woman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious intent, not accidental causation",
    "Causation is assessed through awareness and capacity at time of action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires differentiation by varna and context",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes energetic completion over punitive measures",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification vows aligned with transgression"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent causes fetal termination WITHOUT prior knowledge THEN assign specific vow-based restitution protocol",
    "IF agent belongs to Rajanya OR Vaishya varna AND act was unintentional THEN restrict vow observance to Atreyani form exclusively",
    "IF act involves female party THEN ensure vow alignment corresponds to her spiritual lineage",
    "NO punitive consequence SHALL be applied; restoration through prescribed vrata alone suffices",
    "ALL actions MUST be evaluated for causal chain integrity before assigning dharmic liability"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, intent and awareness must be established beyond reasonable doubt. Where unintentional harm occurs involving reproductive sanctity, judicial response shall invoke specific restorative protocols per varna and gender alignment without recourse to punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms absence of willful intent renders punitive response invalid. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates sequential unawareness as root cause. Proportional responsibility aligns solely with vow-based completion. Non-punitive reality rule upholds consciousness purification over coercive discipline.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vow-specific ritual observance tied to affected individual's spiritual identity",
    "Establish completion process through guided vrata adherence under qualified supervision",
    "Realign agent’s causal awareness via reflective dharmic instruction",
    "Integrate karmic accountability within consciousness field rather than external enforcement",
    "Validate restoration upon full observance verified through attestation by competent authority"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through conscious alignment and vow-based restitution. Reality remains inherently non-punitive when governed by awakened discernment. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
