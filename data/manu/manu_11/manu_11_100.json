  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by Varna-Dharma alignment. A Kshatriya ruler's duty to enforce justice supersedes individual moral judgment, whereas a Brahmana's purity is restored through Tapas, not punitive action. The court must recognize these hierarchies as constitutional foundations rooted in SPH's Avataric Intelligence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from Svadharma. The king’s act is not punitive but restorative—ending disorder. The Brahmana’s Tapas aligns consciousness without inflicting suffering. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation: action arises from role, not personal motive. Responsibility is proportional to capacity; hence, enforcement differs per Varna. Non-punitive reality is upheld as Dharma itself restores balance.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through Svadharma execution. Reality remains non-punitive when governed by consciousness-aligned action. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
