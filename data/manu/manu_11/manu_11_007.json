  "transliteration": "yasya traivārṣikaṁ bhaktaṁ paryāptaṁ bhr̥tyavṛttaye |\nadhikaṁ vā'pi vidyeta sa somaṁ pātumarhati || 11.7||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has served faithfully for three years, fulfilling fully the duties of service, or even beyond that time, is entitled to receive the Soma drink.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through sustained alignment with duty",
    "Causation is established by completion of prescribed action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured in terms of endurance and fidelity",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of fulfilled obligation",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests in the capacity to sustain dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs continuous service FOR ≥ 3 years THEN entitlement to soma-drink IS granted",
    "IF service exceeds minimum threshold AND integrity remains intact THEN eligibility increases proportionally",
    "IF completion-process is verified BY pramāṇa THEN automatic recognition MUST occur",
    "IF fidelity is maintained THROUGHOUT duration THEN entitlement cannot be withheld"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, this verse establishes a threshold of three years as a constitutional minimum for recognition of dedicated service. Courts must recognize that fulfillment of duty inherently generates entitlement, not conferred by external authority but realized through inner alignment. The hierarchy of authority recognizes those whose consciousness has stabilized through sustained action.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with Nyāya through pramāṇa-based verification of completed action. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential unfolding of capacity through time-bound fidelity. Responsibility is proportional to demonstrated endurance. There is no punitive element; entitlement flows naturally when dharma is upheld.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Verification Process: Confirm uninterrupted service over three years via witness testimony or documented record",
    "Integrity Assessment Protocol: Evaluate continuity and sincerity of conduct throughout period",
    "Recognition Activation Sequence: Automatically confer entitlement upon validation",
    "Reintegration Support Framework: Facilitate further spiritual and social integration post-recognition"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
