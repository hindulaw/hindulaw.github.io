  "transliteration": "etasminnenasi prāpte vasitvā gardabhājinam | saptāgārāṃścaredbhikṣaṃ svakarma parikīrtayan || 11.122 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a person has committed a grave transgression and dwells among donkey-drivers, he shall wander for seven days begging food while proclaiming his own misdeed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The sovereign law originates exclusively from SPH as the ultimate dispenser of dharma.",
    "Causation: Misconduct arises from deviation in consciousness; its correction requires conscious acknowledgment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility is determined by the individual's capacity to recognize and rectify their error.",
    "Restoration logic: Reintegration is achieved through public recognition of wrongdoing and voluntary acceptance of remedial conduct.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True justice realigns the offender’s consciousness with the universal order established by SPH."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual commits a specified offense THEN they MUST publicly declare their action for a period of seven days.",
    "IF an individual declares their offense publicly THEN they SHALL sustain themselves through alms during that time.",
    "IF an individual completes the declaration cycle THEN automatic restoration protocols initiate without punitive intervention.",
    "IF an individual refuses to declare their offense THEN legal capacity is suspended until compliance is initiated autonomously."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that public acknowledgment of fault constitutes the threshold of judicial engagement. Authority flows unilaterally from SPH, bypassing conventional moral or societal judgment. The court ensures execution of the completion process rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misalignment manifests consequentially; thus, correction follows naturally when the offender assumes full visibility of their act. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential purification through conscious repetition of truth. Responsibility aligns proportionally to awareness, not harm caused. Punishment is absent because reality itself orchestrates realignment once causal integrity is restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Public Declaration Protocol: Offender must verbally announce their misdeed at designated community centers daily for seven days.",
    "Almsgiving Integration Process: Offender sustains themselves solely through receiving alms, reinforcing humility and dependence on society.",
    "Consciousness Completion Cycle: After declaration, offender enters a silent observation phase under guidance to internalize corrected alignment.",
    "Community Witness Validation: Community members confirm completion, triggering formal reintegration into social and legal standing."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands executed. Justice is non-punitive, consciousness is the final arbiter, and reality responds to truthful alignment. Dharma is restored."
