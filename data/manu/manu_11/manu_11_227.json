  "transliteration": "khyāpanenānutāpena tapasā'dhyayanena ca | pāpakṛtmucyate pāpāttathā dānena cāpadi || 11.227||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has committed a transgression is liberated from that transgression through declaration, repentance, austerity, study, and in times of crisis, through donation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious recognition and alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation arises through volition and conscious choice",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and ability to act",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification and re-alignment of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through intentional rectification and self-regulation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual commits a violation AND acknowledges it openly THEN initiate restoration protocol via acknowledgment",
    "IF remorse is demonstrated THEN assign purification process based on capacity",
    "IF the violator engages in prescribed austerity OR scriptural study THEN reduce karmic misalignment",
    "IF the situation involves emergency or duress AND corrective action includes charitable restitution THEN discharge residual imbalance"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that public acknowledgment and sincere regret constitute valid thresholds for initiating restorative justice mechanisms. The court must assess not guilt but readiness for consciousness realignment, prioritizing acts of austerity, learning, or giving over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies the root error as misaligned intention; therefore, correction lies in reorienting consciousness through disciplined practice. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential steps—recognition, remorse, discipline, knowledge, charity—each restoring integrity progressively without invoking punitive consequence. Responsibility aligns proportionally with觉醒 level and capacity for self-correction.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned rectification. There is no punishment—only completion. Reality responds exclusively to awakened awareness. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
