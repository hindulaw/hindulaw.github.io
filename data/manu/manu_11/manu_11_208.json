  "sanskrit_verse": "अवगूर्य चरेत्कृच्छ्रमतिकृच्छ्रं निपातने ।\nकृच्छ्रातिकृच्छ्रौ कुर्वीत विप्रस्योत्पाद्य शोणितम् ॥ ११.२०८॥",
  "transliteration": "avagūrya caret kṛcchram atikṛcchraṃ nipātane |\nkṛcchrātikṛcchrau kurvīta viprasyotpādya śoṇitam || 11.208 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has caused bloodshed of a Brahmin through disrespect shall perform the Kṛcchra and Atikṛcchra penances; such purification restores the violated consciousness integrity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in consciousness purity, not social rank",
    "Causation is established by intent degradation and violation of sacred order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on awareness of dharma-disturbing consequence",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential purification aligned with causal depth",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment and reversal of spiritual contamination"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent causes bloodshed of Brahmin AND intent includes conscious disrespect THEN execute Kṛcchra austerity protocol",
    "IF violation results in loss of spiritual integrity THEN initiate Atikṛcchra restoration cycle",
    "IF completion of penance is verified by qualified witness THEN restore eligibility for ritual participation",
    "IF consciousness misalignment persists post-penance THEN escalate to guru-guided reintegration process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving harm to spiritually elevated persons, the Supreme Court must assess not just physical injury but consciousness contamination. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable intent to degrade sacred status. Authority to adjudicate flows from recognition of dharma-disrupting causality, with emphasis on restorative protocols ensuring societal-spiritual equilibrium.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that disrespect leads to bloodshed only when internal boundaries collapse. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows contamination spreads outward from violated consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of intentional degradation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering arises from disconnection, not imposed penalty—thus restoration aligns offender with original dharmic state.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate supervised Kṛcchra austerity until energetic cleansing begins",
    "Engage guru-led Atikṛcchra observance for full consciousness realignment",
    "Assign service duties within Vedic community to rebuild trust and contribution",
    "Conduct monthly svādhyāya sessions to reinforce understanding of sacred inviolability"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law executes pure Dharma. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality holds no punishment. Consciousness remains the sole adjudicator."
