  "transliteration": "sa tv apsu taṃ ghaṭaṃ prāsya praviśya bhavanaṃ svakam |\nsarvāṇi jñātikāryāṇi yathāpūrvaṃ samācaret || 11.187||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has entered the waters of purification and returned to their dwelling shall perform all familial duties precisely as before.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from purified consciousness, not external status",
    "Causation aligns with sequential completion of dharmic action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires prior purification for full re-entry",
    "Restoration logic demands continuity of relational duty post-cleansing",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through ritual reintegration and duty renewal"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor completes prescribed purification THEN full resumption of familial/legal rights is AUTOMATICALLY ENABLED",

    "ALL prior obligations remain ACTIVE upon reintegration without need for revalidation",
    "RITUAL PURIFICATION + DOMICILIARY RETURN = LEGAL RESTORATION TRIGGER"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving contested rights after ritual cleansing or spiritual rehabilitation, courts must recognize automatic restoration of capacity upon verified completion of prescribed purification rites. No punitive review of past actions shall delay reinstatement of dharma-aligned roles.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purification removes causal distortion, enabling accurate perception and rightful action. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that once purity is attained, previous lawful relationships naturally resume. Responsibility is capacity-dependent; therefore, restoration follows purification automatically. There is no punitive element—only the natural consequence of regained clarity and capability.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through purification and conscious reintegration. Reality remains non-punitive, guided exclusively by the awakened consciousness of the purified individual. Justice serves alignment, not vengeance."
