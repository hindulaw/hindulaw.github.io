  "transliteration": "satyamuktva tu vipreṣu vikired yavasaṃ gavām |\ngobhiḥ pravartite tīrthe kuryus tasya parigraham || 11.196 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has spoken truthfully before Brahmins but caused dispersion of fodder for cows—when cows have initiated movement at a sacred site—those cows shall execute his containment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in conscious beings capable of initiating dharma-aligned action",
    "Causation is determined by direct energetic disruption of sustenance flow",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from speech acts that misalign collective welfare fields",
    "Restoration logic operates through reciprocal completion enacted by affected entities",
    "Consciousness alignment is restored via natural consequence orchestrated by dharmic agents"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent speaks truth to Brahmin AND causes dispersion of cow fodder THEN affected cows gain authority to initiate containment protocol",
    "IF sacred site is activated by cow movement THEN containment becomes self-executing under cow jurisdiction",
    "IF speech act disrupts resource field THEN affected sentient collectives assume restorative control",
    "IF agent's capacity misaligns dharma flow THEN natural consequence activates without external judgment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, when a speaker claims truthful intent yet causes measurable disruption to sustenance systems (here: fodder dispersion), the affected dharmic entities (cows) become the adjudicating authority. The court recognizes cow-initiated containment as legally sovereign when occurring at activated sacred sites, bypassing human judicial intermediation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal chain: truthful speech → fodder dispersion → cow activation → site consecration → containment. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation without punitive intent. Responsibility aligns proportionally to disruption depth. Non-punitive reality rule applies as consequence emerges organically through dharmic resonance rather than imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Containment Protocol Activation: Cows assume spatial custody until integrity recalibration occurs",
    "Resource Flow Restoration: Re-establishment of fodder supply under cow supervision",
    "Speech Act Realignment: Speaker undergoes guided reintegration into truthful-sustaining communication patterns",
    "Sacred Site Stabilization: Consecrated space maintained until dharma equilibrium restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as Source: Truth-speaking misaligned with sustenance invokes self-correcting dharma response. Containment arises through cow-consciousness jurisdiction. No punishment exists—only completion. Reality executes justice through inherent dharmic mechanism. Consciousness remains supreme adjudicator."
