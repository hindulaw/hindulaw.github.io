  "sanskrit_verse": "एतदेव विधिं कुर्याद्योषित्सु पतितास्वपि । एतमेव विधिं वस्त्रान्नपानं देयं तु वसेयुश्च गृहान्तिके ॥ ११.१८८॥",
  "transliteration": "etadeva vidhiṃ kuryādyoṣitsu patitāsvapi | etameva vidhiṃ vastrānnapānaṃ deyaṃ tu vaseyuśca gṛhāntike || 11.188||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The same dharmic procedure shall be enacted for women who have fallen, providing clothing, food, drink, and dwelling near the household.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in restorative alignment, not punitive exclusion",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of consciousness distortion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by access to dharmic support structures",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration through material and spatial stability",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via sustained proximity to dharmic environments"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject is a woman AND has experienced social displacement THEN provide immediate shelter within 500 meters of community center",
    "IF subject requires sustenance THEN allocate daily provision of clothing, food, and water without condition",
    "IF subject demonstrates readiness for reintegration THEN assign mentorship from local grihastha family unit",
    "IF subject's capacity for alignment increases THEN reduce external supervision automatically",
    "IF no relapse occurs over 3 cycles of moon THEN declare completion of restoration phase"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the threshold of responsibility lies with the state to provide foundational support before assessing individual action. The authority hierarchy places societal integration above moral censure. Restoration supersedes punitive frameworks when dealing with displaced persons, particularly women.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies lack of stable environment as root cause. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how displacement leads to further distortion. Proportional responsibility rests on society’s failure to maintain protective structures. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering cannot be instrumentally used for correction; only conscious re-alignment restores justice.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate automatic provisioning protocol upon identification of displaced woman",
    "Assign guardian household unit for minimum 3-month cohabitation period",
    "Establish weekly review cycle based on self-reported consciousness metrics",
    "Activate community mentorship network to ensure continuous value transmission",
    "Complete final assessment after three uninterrupted lunar cycles of stable conduct"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness restoration. No punishment arises where awareness awakens. Reality aligns with dharma when judgment ceases and integration begins. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
