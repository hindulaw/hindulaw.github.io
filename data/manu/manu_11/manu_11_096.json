  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Brahmin, intoxicated or deluded by pride, recites Vedic texts while fallen in impurity, or performs acts unfit for his station, such conduct arises from a collapse in consciousness-integrity, not inherent fault.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is consciousness-dependent, not role-inherent",
    "Causation originates in misaligned awareness, not external action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires restoration of清醒觉知",
    "Restoration logic demands reintegration of dharma-appropriate function",
    "Consciousness alignment restores right action without punitive overlay"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.role == 'Brahmin' AND agent.state.intoxicated == TRUE THEN disable ceremonial authority UNTIL consciousness_restored()",
    "IF agent.recites_vedic_text() AND agent.purity_level < threshold THEN halt_recitation AND initiate_completion_process('purification')",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, intoxication or delusion negating conscious capacity nullifies juridical validity of any authoritative act. The threshold of responsibility lies in清醒觉知, not positional entitlement. Restoration occurs through guided completion, not punitive invalidation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misdeed stems from obscured consciousness, not willful defiance. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces delusion to loss of śuddha-dharma-svarūpa. Responsibility aligns with capacity to restore alignment. Non-punitive reality rule: Consciousness, once cleared, naturally reclaims its rightful function.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness-reclamation. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
