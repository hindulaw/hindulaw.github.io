  "transliteration": "akurvan vihitaṁ karma ninditaṁ ca samācaran | prasaktaś caindriyārtheṣu prāyaścittīyate naraḥ || 11.44 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who neglects prescribed duties, engages in condemned acts, and remains attached to sensory objects becomes liable for conscious restoration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Action must align with dharma-sourced injunctions.",
    "Causation: Attachment to sense objects leads to distortion of duty execution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Liability arises from volitional engagement and omission.",
    "Restoration logic: Correction is mandated through completion, not punishment.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Reorientation toward svadharma restores integrity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent omits prescribed action THEN initiate capacity-restoring protocol.",
    "IF agent performs proscribed act THEN assign corrective consciousness-realignment process.",
    "IF sensory attachment is detected THEN deploy sequential awareness-integration mechanism.",
    "IF completion is achieved THEN liability ceases automatically.",
    "IF misalignment recurs THEN escalate restoration intensity without punitive attribution."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in volition and capacity. Omission of duty or indulgence in proscribed conduct necessitates judicial activation of restorative protocols, prioritizing consciousness realignment over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that distorted action stems from misaligned consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential correction. Responsibility is proportional to capacity. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering is not justice; completion is liberation.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator. Dharma is restored."
