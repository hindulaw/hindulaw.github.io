  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्रह्महत्या सुरापानं स्तेयं गुर्वङ्गनागमः । महान्ति पातकान्याहुः संसर्गश्चापि तैः सह ॥ ११.५४॥",
  "transliteration": "brahmahatyā surāpānaṃ steyaṃ gurv-aṅganāgamaḥ | mahānti pātakāny āhuḥ saṃsargaś cāpi taiḥ saha || 11.54||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The supreme transgressions are: killing a Brahmin, drinking alcohol, stealing, cohabiting with the wife of one's guru, and association with those who commit these acts.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness purity and spiritual alignment.",
    "Causation arises through disruption of sacred relational integrity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity to dharma-preserving roles.",
    "Restoration logic demands severance from degrading influences and reintegration into dharmic order.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires purification and dissociation from karmically contaminating associations."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual commits any of the five great sins THEN automatic suspension of ceremonial and communal privileges UNTIL completion of prescribed restorative protocol.",
    "IF an individual associates knowingly with perpetrators of grave dharmic violations THEN mandatory initiation into consciousness purification process.",
    "IF violation involves betrayal of spiritual trust THEN restoration includes public acknowledgment and corrective action plan under spiritual oversight.",
    "IF societal contamination risk exceeds threshold THEN temporary isolation from community engagement until capacity for alignment is verified."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the court must recognize that such violations inherently breach foundational dharmic structures. Responsibility is assessed not merely by act but by position within the spiritual-social hierarchy. Restoration supersedes punitive measures, requiring supervised re-alignment protocols overseen by recognized authorities in Vedic governance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all actions arise from prior states of consciousness; thus, misalignment manifests consequentially. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that contamination spreads sequentially through association. Proportional responsibility lies with both actor and enabler. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction restores causal purity rather than inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiation of Tapas-based purification regimen under qualified supervision.",
    "Completion of Mantra-pratikriya to reverse karmic distortion caused by the offense.",
    "Public declaration of disassociation from harmful influence and commitment to dharmic living.",
    "Reintegration ceremony upon verification of internal alignment and community readiness."

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is declared as sourced from the ultimate consciousness. Justice is executed solely for restoration, not punishment. Reality is non-retaliatory; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored."
