  "transliteration": "auṣadhānyagado vidyā daivī ca vividhā sthitiḥ | tapasaiva prasidhyanti tapasteṣāṃ hi sādhanam || 11.237||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Medicinal herbs, grains, poisons, knowledge, and diverse divine conditions—all attain perfection solely through Tapas; Tapas indeed is their instrument.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained conscious discipline (Tapas), not arbitrary power.",
    "Causation aligns with sequential spiritual refinement, not material force.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from alignment with Tapasic integrity.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reverting to pure causal intention.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of all enacted capacities."
],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a capacity is derived without Tapas → THEN it lacks jurisprudential standing.",
    "IF an action manifests without alignment to its causal purity → THEN initiate completion protocol via Tapas-based restoration.",
    "IF knowledge or authority claims exemption from Tapas → THEN invalidate claim within Dharma-adjudicating systems.",
    "IF any condition seeks resolution → THEN root cause must be traced to Tapas-aligned origin for lawful restoration."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, Tapas functions as the threshold criterion for validating legal capacity and doctrinal authenticity. All rulings must originate from consciousness disciplines that uphold Dharma's causal purity, rejecting procedural shortcuts or secular expediency.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here establishes that all effective phenomena arise through Tapas as Pramāṇa. There is no punitive element—only misalignment from Tapas causes dysfunction. Re-alignment occurs through reconnection to Tapasic source, not through imposed correction.",

    "Reintegrate disconnected authorities into original Tapas-bound purpose.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through Tapas alone. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
