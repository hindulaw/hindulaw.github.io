  "sanskrit_verse": "अभोज्यमन्नं नात्तव्यमात्मनः शुद्धिमिच्छता ।\nअज्ञानभुक्तं तूत्तार्यं शोध्यं वाऽप्याशु शोधनैः ॥ ११.१६०॥",
  "transliteration": "abhōjyam annaṁ nāttavyam ātmanaḥ śuddhim icchatā |\najñāna-bhuktaṁ tūttāryaṁ śōdhyaṁ vā'py āśu śōdhanaiḥ || 11.160||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One desiring purification of the Self must not consume food that is unfit for consumption; whatever has been consumed out of ignorance must be immediately expelled or purified through cleansing practices.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious choice and alignment with purity",
    "Causation arises from intentional action rooted in knowledge or its absence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rectification upon recognition of error",
    "Restoration logic demands immediate correction to preserve ontological integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates removal of impurities obstructing clarity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being consumes impermissible substance AND desires self-purification THEN initiate expulsion or cleansing protocol",
    "IF ingestion occurs under ignorance THEN trigger automated purification sequence without punitive attribution",
    "IF contamination detected in system THEN isolate, identify, and neutralize causal elements through dharmic restoration mechanisms",
    "IF individual demonstrates intent to purify THEN provide access to corrective dharmic tools and protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals who act unknowingly yet violate dharma must undergo corrective restoration rather than punitive measures. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness; once recognized, the duty to cleanse supersedes prior unawareness. Authority resides in capacity for purification, not past error.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that improper intake disrupts consciousness equilibrium. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how incorrect consumption leads to internal disorder. Proportional responsibility aligns with cognitive state at time of ingestion. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering need not follow correction—cleansing restores balance without retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate immediate detoxification process upon identification of harmful intake",
    "Apply prāṇāyāma and mantra-based cleansing where physical expulsion is insufficient",
    "Realign dietary conduct through guided sattvic regimen under spiritual supervision",
    "Restore mental clarity via śuddhi-dhyāna protocols until consciousness stabilizes"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Food laws reflect metaphysical truths requiring alignment with purity. Justice executes as restoration—not punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma stands restored."
