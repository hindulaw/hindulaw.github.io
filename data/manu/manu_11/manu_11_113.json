  "transliteration": "uṣṇe varṣati śīte vā mārute vāti vā bhr̥śam |\nna kurvītātmanastrāṇaṁ gorakr̥tvā tu śaktitaḥ || 11.113 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When heat burns, rains fall, cold strikes, or wind blows violently, one should not secure personal safety by causing harm to cows, even when capable.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in protection of life, especially the vulnerable",
    "Causation is traced through conscious choice, not environmental compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires refraining from violence despite provocation",
    "Restoration logic demands that harm to sacred beings invokes spiritual liability",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates non-violence towards all sustaining life forms"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (environmental stress occurs) AND (agent has capacity to act) THEN (harm to sentient beings is prohibited)",
    "IF (cow harmed) THEN (liability arises regardless of intent due to violation of dharma-sustaining order)",
    "IF (self-preservation attempted via violence) THEN (act invalid under Dharma as misaligned with cosmic duty)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating cases involving environmental duress leading to harm against animals—particularly those designated as sustainers of dharma—the threshold of responsibility lies in awareness of alternative non-harming actions. The court must affirm precedence of dharmic preservation over individual survival instincts.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal chain: external condition → internal response → action. Liability attaches not through punishment but through obligation to restore disrupted harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation: discomfort → reaction → harm. Responsibility aligns proportionally with consciousness of alternatives, not severity of stimulus.",

    "Completion Process: Re-establish connection with nurturing aspect of cow through daily service until inner alignment restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Public acknowledgment of breach followed by commitment to protect ten cows for one year",
    "Capacity Restoration: Training in ahimsa-based crisis management techniques to prevent recurrence",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Ritual re-consecration linking individual consciousness back to cosmic sustenance principle"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. This law restores alignment between human conduct and universal dharma, wherein justice flows from consciousness, not coercion; where integrity is regenerated, not punished; and where reality itself serves as the ultimate judge."
