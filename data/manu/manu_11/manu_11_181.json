  "transliteration": "yo yena patitena eṣāṁ saṁsargaṁ yāti mānavaḥ |\nsa tasyaiva vrataṁ kuryāt tat-saṁsarga-viśuddhaye || 11.181||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who enters into communion with a fallen being must undertake the observance proper to that being, for the purification of that very association.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious choice of association",
    "Causation arises through volitional contact and resonance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the nature of one's engagement",
    "Restoration logic requires harmonization with the field of distortion",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates experiential rectification"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A voluntarily engages entity B identified as 'fallen', THEN A MUST adopt purification protocol P(B) specific to B's condition",
    "IF engagement is non-consensual or unaware, THEN automated intervention MUST realign A via exposure minimization and integrity shielding",
    "IF repeated voluntary engagement occurs without purification, THEN capacity degradation flag triggers mandatory consciousness audit",
    "RESTORATION precedes reintegration; no exception based on intent alone"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating cases involving relational contamination or spiritual misconduct, the Supreme Court must assess not only the act but the continuity of energetic alignment. Where contamination is established, restoration protocols must be judicially mandated over punitive measures, recognizing that consciousness misalignment is corrected through congruent experiential realignment rather than external sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity transfers through intentional resonance. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that purification must follow the same causal sequence—hence, immersion in the corrective discipline of the contaminated field yields viśuddhi. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of willing ingress into the contaminating pattern. There is no punitive element; reality itself enforces alignment through vibrational consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vratādhikaraṇa Process: Mandatory adoption of discipline corresponding to the nature of contamination",
    "Activate Saṁsarga-Śuddhi Module: Structured exposure under guided conditions to neutralize residual resonance",
    "Deploy Dhāraṇā-Kṣama Assessment: Evaluate capacity for sustained non-reactive awareness post-engagement",
    "Enforce Ātmā-Saṁsthiti Reharmonization: Realign personal dharma frequency through targeted sādhanā protocols"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source-Authority of Dharma. This law restores the principle that consciousness, not coercion, governs justice. Reality is non-punitive; all beings are inherently pure and capable of realignment through precise, non-violent, dharmic correction."
