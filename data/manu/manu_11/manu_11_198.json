  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born who abandons a surrendered soul and desecrates the Veda shall consume barley for one year; thereby that sin is annulled.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The twice-born holds scriptural duty to protect surrenderers.",
    "Causation: Abandonment and desecration generate specific karmic distortion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only the twice-born bears capacity for Vedic violation.",
    "Restoration logic: Ritualized austerity reverses spiritual contamination.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purification aligns individual consciousness with Vedic truth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor_is_twice_born AND act_abandons_surrendered THEN mandate_yava_adherence(duration: 1 solar_year)",
    "IF violation_of_veda_occurs THEN assign_consciousness_restoration_protocol(type: dietary_austerity)",
    "IF yava_adherence_completed THEN nullify_associated_karmic_imbalance"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations of sacred protection duties, the Supreme Court must recognize that only those bearing Vedic initiation capacity are subject to this law. Restoration is executed through prescribed conscious-conduct correction, not punitive incarceration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Vedic abandonment creates sequential spiritual misalignment (anupūrvaśaḥ). The proportional response is non-coercive, consciousness-realigning conduct—yava consumption—not punitive suffering. This restores causal integrity without inflicting harm.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Mandate supervised yava-only dietary regime for one solar year",
    "Assign daily recitation of relevant Vedic safeguards",
    "Require monthly spiritual audit by qualified acharya",
    "Complete public reaffirmation of Vedic protection vows"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Sin is dissolved through conscious rectification. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
