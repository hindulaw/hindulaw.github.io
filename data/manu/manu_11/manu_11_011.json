  "transliteration": "yajñaścetpratiruddhaḥ syādekeneṅgena yajvanaḥ | brāhmaṇasya viśeṣeṇa dhārmike sati rājani || 11.11||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a sacrifice is obstructed by one limb of the sacrificer, the king, in the presence of a Brahmana versed in Dharma, shall execute completion through the Brahmana's specialized capacity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the king only when aligned with Dharmic capacity",
    "Causation is determined by obstruction of consecrated action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows to the most qualified restorer",
    "Restoration logic supersedes individual fault attribution",
    "Consciousness alignment is enacted through ritual integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF sacrifice is obstructed AND obstruction originates from agent’s limb THEN king MUST engage Brahmana WITH Dharmic specialization",
    "IF Dharmic specialist is present THEN restoration protocol overrides punitive inquiry",
    "IF king acts under Dharmic witness THEN action is self-validating and irreversible",
    "IF ritual integrity is compromised THEN completion process MUST precede adjudication",
    "IF capacity exists THEN responsibility is non-transferable and consciousness-bound"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when sacred duty or national dharma is obstructed by partial agency, the court must invoke Dharmically qualified authorities for restoration rather than assign blame. The presence of a Dharmic specialist renders intervention self-authorizing and beyond punitive inquiry.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that obstruction arises from incomplete manifestation, not willful violation. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential misalignment, thus proportional response is realignment through qualified capacity. Responsibility is neither moral nor punitive but ontological—corrected via Dharmic completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sacrificial completion through Dharmic Brahmana specialization",
    "Align obstructed limb with original consecration intent",
    "Establish witness-consciousness through royal-Dharmic conjunction",

    "Confirm non-recurrence through sustained Dharmic resonance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
