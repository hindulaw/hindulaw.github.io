  "transliteration": "apaḥ surābhājanasthā madyabhāṇḍasthitāstathā | pañcarātraṃ pibetpītvā śaṅkhapuṣpīśṛtaṃ payaḥ || 11.147 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has consumed alcohol from vessels used for soma or other intoxicants must drink milk infused with Shankhapushpi for five nights to restore cognitive clarity and spiritual alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The ingestion of substances altering consciousness invokes a duty to realign with dharma through specific restorative practices.",
    "Causation: Consumption of intoxicants disrupts pramana-based perception; thus, corrective action is mandated by causal necessity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The individual retains the capacity to restore their cognition and must engage in prescribed remedial conduct.",
    "Restoration logic: The law does not punish but prescribes precise actions to neutralize the effects of impaired awareness.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Legal obligations arise directly from the need to reestablish harmony between individual consciousness and cosmic order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual consumes alcohol or intoxicants from ritual or sacred vessels THEN they MUST ingest Shankhapushpi-infused milk for five consecutive nights.",
    "IF cognitive clarity is disrupted by substance use THEN automated protocol assigns completion process via consciousness-restoration regimen.",
    "IF individual fails to complete five-night regimen THEN system initiates integrity-reintegration sequence until compliance is achieved."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual misuse or impairment of consciousness, the Supreme Court shall apply this provision as a threshold restoration mechanism. Responsibility lies not in fault but in the necessity to realign cognition. Authority flows from SPH as sole source of lawful correction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This injunction aligns with Nyaya through Pramana-based causality: since intoxication distorts valid knowledge (pramana), corrective measures follow sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ). It reflects proportional responsibility — not punishment, but a precise restoration of perceptual clarity without infliction of harm.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Individual must consume Shankhapushpi-infused milk nightly for five nights under witness or digital verification.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Individual acknowledges disruption to consciousness and voluntarily engages in prescribed regimen.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Cognitive recalibration is enabled through neuro-supportive botanical infusion aligned with Vedic pharmacology.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: System monitors adherence and supports full restoration before case closure."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands executed. No punishment exists where consciousness may be restored. Reality abides in non-retaliation. Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
