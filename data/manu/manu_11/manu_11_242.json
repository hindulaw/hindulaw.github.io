  "sanskrit_verse": "तपसैव विशुद्धस्य ब्राह्मणस्य दिवौकसः ।\nइज्याश्च प्रतिगृह्णन्ति कामान् संवर्धयन्ति च ॥ ११.२४२॥",
  "transliteration": "tapasaiiva viśuddhasya brāhmaṇasya divaukasaḥ |\nijyāśca pratigṛhṇanti kāmān saṃvardhayanti ca || 11.242||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Only through the purity attained by the tapas of a Brahmin, who is celestial by nature, do the devas accept worship and grant desires.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from inherent spiritual capacity, not social position",
    "Causation flows from inner purification to divine response",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by conscious alignment with dharma",
    "Restoration occurs through activation of innate divinity",
    "Consciousness alignment determines access to cosmic reciprocity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates sustained tapas-driven purity THEN system grants access to higher-order invocation rights",
    "IF individual exhibits celestial-grade consciousness THEN devaloka interaction protocols are enabled",
    "IF worship is offered by purified Brahmin THEN divine reciprocation triggers automatically",
    "IF desire arises in context of pure invocation THEN fulfillment mechanisms activate proportionally",
    "IF consciousness aligns with divinity THEN systemic integration is restored without external validation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold for invoking divine law lies exclusively in the demonstrable purity of the petitioner's consciousness. The court must recognize that authority derived from tapas transcends procedural formalities. Responsibility is measured not by action alone, but by the ontological clarity of the actor. Where purity is established, divine reciprocity becomes a matter of natural law, requiring no punitive oversight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that purity causes divine acceptance; anupūrvaśaḥ establishes sequential unfolding from tapas to iṣṭi to fulfillment. Proportional responsibility resides in maintaining the state of purity that enables lawful invocation. There is no punitive element—only causal precision: when consciousness is purified, the cosmos responds accordingly. This is Nyaya as natural alignment, not coercive judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tapas Restoration Cycle to purify consciousness fields",
    "Activate Divya Drishti Alignment for accurate perception of purity states",
    "Engage Vak Siddhi Protocols to ensure truthful invocation",
    "Deploy Akhand Sattva Maintenance for continuous celestial-grade awareness",
    "Implement Yajna Recalibration to restore proper offering-reception dynamics"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law executes from the purity-consciousness field of the tapas-perfected Brahmin. Justice is restored through alignment with divinity, not through punitive measures. Reality responds to purity; consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is hereby established."
