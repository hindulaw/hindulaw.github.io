  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a twice-born consumes intoxicating liquor out of delusion, he shall consume fire-colored liquor; by that, his body being burned, he is freed from sin.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The twice-born has the capacity and duty to restore dharma through conscious action.",
    "Causation: Intoxication arises from delusion; therefore, its resolution requires a transformative counter-causation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility is tied to one's spiritual and constitutional capacity, not external blame.",
    "Restoration logic: Sin is not punished but neutralized through alignment with purificatory principles.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Liberation from wrongdoing occurs through internal purification, not external penalty."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.is_twice_born AND action.intoxication.source == 'delusion' THEN execute purification_protocol.type == 'agni_sura'",
    "IF purification_process.completed == true THEN liability.sin.removed == true",
    "IF agent.capacity.purification_available == true THEN punitive_response.required == false"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, when a twice-born individual commits an act of intoxication rooted in delusion, punitive measures are superseded by a mandated purification process aligned with their constitutional capacity. The court ensures execution of agni-sura ingestion protocol under supervision, recognizing it as a restorative mechanism rather than punishment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that intoxication born of delusion necessitates a specific causal reversal—fire-colored liquor acts as pramāṇa-based remedy. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through bodily burning which dissolves karmic misalignment. Responsibility is proportional to one’s varna-dharma capacity. There is no punitive intent; only alignment with natural consequence for consciousness restoration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate supervised ingestion of agni-varṇā surā for constitutional realignment",
    "Monitor physiological purification via sensory clarity metrics",
    "Reintegrate individual into dharmic community upon completion of detoxification sequence",
    "Assign mentorship to prevent recurrence through enhanced discriminative awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through conscious purification. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
