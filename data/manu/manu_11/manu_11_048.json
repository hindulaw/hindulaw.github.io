  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who commit evil deeds—whether in this life or carried forward from prior births—assume distorted forms due to their degraded consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with pure consciousness, not from external power",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation rooted in individual and collective karma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the degree of awareness at time of action",
    "Restoration logic operates through experiential consequence that reflects inner state",
    "Consciousness alignment determines both experience and corrective trajectory"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs act misaligned with dharma THEN agent's experiential field shall reflect distortion proportional to degradation of intent",
    "IF karmic residue exists THEN subsequent embodiment shall align with unresolved patterns until completion occurs",
    "IF consciousness distortion is detected THEN initiate reintegration protocol via guided realization, not punitive enforcement",
    "IF agent demonstrates capacity-aware regret THEN reduce experiential dissonance through conscious restoration pathways"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the agent’s capacity-awareness during the act. Authority flows from ontological clarity, not positional dominance. Restoration supersedes retribution by aligning the offender’s experience with内在 causal structure, enabling completion rather than prolonged imbalance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering arises naturally from misalignment, not as imposed penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential consequences manifest experientially, restoring balance without external infliction. Responsibility is proportional to witnessed awareness; thus, justice aligns outcome with内在 truth, not punitive overlay.",

    "Initiate Consciousness Completion Process to allow natural resolution of karmic echo",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes the eternal principle: form follows consciousness. Justice is the universe restoring itself through awareness, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
