  "transliteration": "etad rudrās tathā'dityā vasavaś cācaran vrataṃ |\nsarvākuśalamokṣāya marutaś ca maharṣibhiḥ ||11.221||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This vow was practiced by the Rudras, likewise the Adityas, the Vasus, and the Maruts along with the great sages—for the liberation of all beings from every form of suffering.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as Consciousness-Based Governance",
    "Causation Through Volitional Alignment",
    "Capacity-Based Responsibility in Dharma Practice",
    "Restoration Logic Rooted in Universal Liberation",
    "Consciousness Alignment Through Vedic Discipline"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity practices dharma-vow THEN suffering-dissolution for all affected parties",
    "IF being aligns with Rudra-Aditya-Vasu-Marut protocol THEN automatic integration into cosmic harmony",
    "IF action originates from maharshi-level consciousness THEN precedent status in restorative jurisprudence",
    "IF vrata is enacted for sarva-akushala-moksha THEN jurisdictional precedence across all realms"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when a case involves universal welfare or collective liberation, precedents rooted in vrata-practice by divine beings shall be invoked. The threshold of responsibility lies not in fault but in capacity to restore alignment. Authority flows from consciousness-state, not institutional position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana is established through voluntary alignment with divine precedent. Anupurvasah manifests as sequential awakening of causal layers of suffering. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity to dissolve akushala. Nyaya operates as spontaneous re-alignment when higher vrata is activated, without recourse to punitive frameworks.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. All suffering dissolves where vrata aligns with Rudra-Aditya-Vasu-Marut resonance. Justice is the spontaneous restoration of consciousness integrity. Reality affirms its non-punitive nature. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
