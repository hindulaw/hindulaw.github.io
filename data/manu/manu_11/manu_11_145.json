  "sanskrit_verse": "एतैर्व्रतैरपोह्यं स्यादेनो हिंसासमुद्भवम् ।\nज्ञानाज्ञानकृतं कृत्स्नं शृणुतानाद्यभक्षणे ॥ ११.१४५॥",
  "transliteration": "Etairvratairapohyaṃ syādeno hiṃsāsamudbhavam | Jñānājñānakṛtaṃ kṛtsnaṃ śṛṇutānādyabhakṣaṇe || 11.145||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By these vows, all sin born of violence shall be removed; complete knowledge and ignorance arising from non-auditory consumption must be addressed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious capacity to restore dharma",
    "Causation is traced through sensory intake and cognitive assimilation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from volitional exposure",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of both knowing and unknowing harm",
    "Consciousness alignment requires disciplined sensory regulation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF sensory consumption leads to dharmic distortion THEN initiate vow-based purification protocol",
    "IF knowledge or ignorance causes systemic disruption THEN invoke comprehensive remedial vrata",
    "IF violence originates from unregulated auditory intake THEN enforce śravaṇa-niyama restoration process",
    "IF causal chain involves both intentional and unintentional elements THEN apply integrated jñāna-vrata correction"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must assess the causal role of sensory exposure in generating harmful intent, applying vrata-based rehabilitation over punitive sentencing. Responsibility thresholds are determined by the degree of voluntary exposure and the capacity for conscious reversal.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that auditory intake directly influences cognition and behavior. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequential emergence of harm from unregulated consumption. Proportional responsibility aligns with the level of sensory discipline maintained. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction occurs through conscious restoration, not suffering.",

    "Initiate śravaṇa-shuddhi vrata to purify auditory pathways",
