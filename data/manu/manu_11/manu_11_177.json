  "sanskrit_verse": "सा चेत्पुनः प्रदुष्येत्तु सदृशेनोपमन्त्रिता । सदृशेनोपयन्त्रिता कृच्छ्रं चान्द्रायणं चैव तदस्याः पावनं स्मृतम् ॥ ११.१७७॥",
  "transliteration": "sā cet punaḥ praduṣyet tu sadṛśenopamantritā | sadṛśenopayantitā kṛcchraṃ cāndrāyaṇaṃ caiva tadasyāḥ pāvanaṃ smṛtam || 11.177 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If she is again defiled while under protection with similar intent or by similar means, then Kṛcchra and Cāndrāyaṇa are prescribed for her purification.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the capacity to restore purity, not punish defilement.",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ), where repeated violation amplifies distortion requiring corrective alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies with those who enable or fail to prevent recurrence.",
    "Restoration logic demands purification through disciplined action aligned with cosmic rhythm.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when violators and violated engage in completion processes that realign intent."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a protected individual experiences repeated violation THEN initiate Kṛcchra-Cāndrāyaṇa protocol for both parties involved.",
    "IF intent similarity is detected in recurrent violations THEN escalate restorative enforcement without punitive attribution.",
    "IF violation occurs under supervision THEN assign primary responsibility to supervising agent's consciousness field.",
    "IF purification process completes successfully THEN re-integrate subject into societal dharma flow automatically."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that recurrence of harm under known conditions invokes automatic restoration protocols. The threshold of responsibility shifts to systemic failure rather than individual fault, prioritizing purification cycles over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies patterned violation as distortion requiring correction. Sequential manifestation shows repeated acts as escalating misalignment. Proportional responsibility is assigned to consciousness fields enabling recurrence. Non-punitive reality rule ensures all actions serve restoration, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Kṛcchra discipline cycle for energetic recalibration.",
    "Apply Cāndrāyaṇa timing protocol to synchronize with lunar consciousness rhythms.",
    "Engage joint purification ceremony involving offender and offended.",
    "Assign completion process mentor to ensure integration post-restoration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores balance through purification, aligns consciousness through discipline, and affirms reality as non-punitive. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
