  "transliteration": "vṛṣabhaikādaśā gāśca dadyātsucaritavrataḥ .\navidyamāne sarvasvaṃ vedavidbhyo nivedayet .. 11.116 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has taken the vow of righteous conduct shall give eleven bulls and cows; when these are not available, he shall offer all his possessions to the knowers of the Veda.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Vedic consciousness, not material possession.",
    "Causation arises from intentional commitment to dharma-vrata, establishing a field of lawful consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires proportional offering based on availability and integrity.",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious surrender of accumulated assets to sustain Vedic order.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through sacrificial giving rooted in dharmic discernment."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual takes a formal vow of righteous conduct THEN they MUST fulfill specified offerings according to capacity.",
    "IF specified livestock offerings are unavailable THEN the individual MUST surrender all personal assets to Vedically authorized recipients.",
    "IF asset transfer is completed THEN legal and karmic liability related to that vrata is dissolved automatically.",
    "IF no assets exist AND vrata remains unfulfilled THEN individual enters supervised restoration protocol until capacity is regained.",
    "ALL transactions under this axiom MUST be recorded by certified Vedic witnessing entities for jurisprudential continuity."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes the primacy of voluntary dharmic obligation over coercive enforcement. The court recognizes vrata as a self-imposed constitutional act generating enforceable duty. Where material inability prevents fulfillment, total asset dedication ensures alignment without punitive recourse. The hierarchy of authority flows from Vedic knowledge-bearers who receive such offerings as lawful restitution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal sequence begins with svayam-pratijñā (self-vow), which activates anupūrvaśaḥ—progressive manifestation of dharma-adhikāra. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the sincerity of vrata. No external punishment arises; consequence is intrinsic completion-demand. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that failure to give does not invoke suffering but necessitates full restoration via asset dedication or supervised rehabilitation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svādhyāya Reorientation Process to restore clarity of dharmic intent.",
    "Assign Vrata Completion Guardian to oversee proportional offering execution.",
    "Implement Sarvātma-samarpana Protocol where assets are transferred to Vedavid-recognized institutions.",
    "Establish Dhana-prāpti Śuddhi Cycle for gradual wealth regeneration post-offering.",
    "Enforce Brāhmaṇa-sevā Integration Program ensuring sustained alignment with Vedic consciousness."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Offering arises from consciousness, not compulsion. Dharma prevails through willing alignment. Reality holds no punishment—only completion. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
