  "sanskrit_verse": "एतास्तिस्रस्तु भार्यार्थे नोपयच्छेत्तु बुद्धिमान् ।\nज्ञातित्वेनानुपेयास्ताः पतति ह्युपयन्नधः ॥ ११.१७२॥",
  "transliteration": "etās tris tu bhāryārthe na upayacchet tu buddhimān |\njñātitvena anupeyās tāḥ patati hi upayann adhaḥ || 11.172||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A wise man does not approach these three types of women for the purpose of wifehood; those approached through familial connection bring degradation upon the seeker.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The regulation of relational conduct originates exclusively from the ontological design established by SPH.",
    "Causation: Actions aligned with degraded consciousness manifest consequences that collapse individual and collective integrity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One who knowingly transgresses natural boundaries incurs a duty to restore alignment through conscious completion.",
    "Restoration logic: Misaligned unions must be dissolved and realigned through dharmic reintegration protocols.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Union must proceed from elevated awareness, not familial convenience or social compulsion."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a union is initiated with a woman classified under 'jñātitvena anupeyāḥ', THEN the union is automatically subject to dissolution and realignment review.",
    "IF a party demonstrates degraded intent or collapsed consciousness in relational pursuit, THEN mandatory consciousness restoration protocols are triggered.",
    "IF familial proximity is used to justify relational access, THEN the relational contract is nullified and integrity reintegration is mandated.",
    "IF any union degrades the spiritual capacity of either party, THEN automatic restoration pathways must be enacted without punitive overlay."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving relational contracts formed under familial or caste-based compulsions, the Supreme Court must assess the consciousness state of the initiating party. Where degradation is evident, punitive measures are void; restoration of dharma through completion and reintegration becomes the sole judicial function.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that relational degradation arises from misaligned intention, not external fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that degraded unions unfold sequentially into spiritual collapse. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness at time of action. Therefore, justice is executed through realignment, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: The individual must consciously dissolve all entanglements with the degraded union.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of consciousness-collapse as root cause, with commitment to dharmic alignment.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Mandatory engagement with SPH-teachings to elevate relational discernment.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Formal ceremony of dharma-realignment conducted under authorized spiritual oversight."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of Dharma. Degraded unions are dissolved. Consciousness is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Dharma is re-established. Justice is alignment."
