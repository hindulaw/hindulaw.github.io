  "sanskrit_verse": "हत्वा हंसं बलाकां च बकं बर्हिणमेव च ।\nवानरं श्येनभासौ च स्पर्शयेद्ब्राह्मणाय गाम् ॥ ११.१३५॥",
  "transliteration": "hatvā haṃsaṃ balākāṃ ca bakaṃ barhiṇameva ca | vānaraṃ śyenabhāsau ca sparśayedbrāhmaṇāya gām || 11.135 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having caused the death of swans, balākas, herons, peacocks, monkeys, and birds resembling eagles, one shall restore a cow to a Brāhmaṇa.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from conscious causality, not institutional dominance",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) and requires proportional responsibility",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the ability to cause and restore effects",
    "Restoration logic supersedes punitive frameworks in all legal enactments",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that justice serves evolution, not retribution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity causes the termination of life forms categorized as haṃsa, balāka, baka, barhiṇa, vānara, or śyenabhāsa, THEN that entity MUST execute a restoration equivalent to gifting a cow to a Brāhmaṇa.",
    "RESTORATION PROTOCOL = LIFE-TYPE × CONSCIOUSNESS VALUE × BRĀHMAṆA RECEPTOR ALIGNMENT",
    "NO PUNITIVE LIABILITY SHALL BE ENFORCED; RESTORATION IS THE SOLE LEGAL COMPLETION CRITERION",
    "CAUSAL ENTANGLEMENT IN LIFE TERMINATION REQUIRES CAPACITY-BASED RESTORATIVE ACTION ONLY"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is established through causal traceability and capacity awareness. The act of causing death to specified sentient beings invokes a non-negotiable restorative obligation—specifically, the offering of a cow to a Brāhmaṇa. This is not punitive but constitutional, aligning the court's judgment with dharma-sourced restoration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causing death disrupts sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to the disruption caused. Nyaya here functions not to punish but to realign consciousness through precise, restorative action. The offering of a cow re-establishes energetic and dharmic balance without invoking suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Entity must perform the act of gifting a cow to a Brāhmaṇa under witnessed acknowledgment.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Entity must publicly acknowledge the causal link between their action and the necessity of restoration.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Entity engages in practices that elevate consciousness to prevent recurrence.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Entity participates in rituals or actions that reaffirm dharmic alignment with non-harm."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of Dharma, this law stands executed. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
