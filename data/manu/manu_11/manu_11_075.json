  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who recites any Veda for a hundred leagues shall neutralize the sin of killing a Brahmin; such a one governs his senses with measured wisdom.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Vedantic practice and spiritual discipline",
    "Causation flows through conscious intent purified by scriptural engagement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by sensory mastery and inner restraint",
    "Restoration logic operates via proportional dharmic counteraction",
    "Consciousness alignment arises through disciplined recitation and sensory regulation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs continuous Vedic recitation over specified distance THEN residual karmic misalignment due to Brahmin-related harm IS nullified",
    "IF sensory control AND measured cognition ARE demonstrated THEN jurisdictional capacity FOR dharmic restoration IS granted",
    "IF violation occurs IN domain of sacred knowledge THEN corrective action SHALL BE enacted THROUGH scriptural repetition at scale",
    "IF individual exhibits disciplined conduct post-transgression THEN societal reintegration PROTOCOLS activate automatically"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that intentional remedial acts—specifically Vedic recitation across measurable spatial extent—constitute valid restorative jurisprudence when addressing violations involving sacred life. The court must recognize capacity-based rehabilitation evidenced through disciplined ritual performance rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa lies in observable behavioral transformation aligned with Vedic discipline. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential purification through sustained mantra vibration. Proportional responsibility aligns with the magnitude of corrective effort. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that experiential consequence dissolves upon completion of prescribed dharmic act.",
