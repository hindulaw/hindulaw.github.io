  "transliteration": "ato'nyatamam āsthāya vidhiṁ vipraḥ samāhitaḥ |\nbramhahatyākṛtaṁ pāpaṁ vyapohatyātmavattayā || 11.86||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Therefore, having taken up any one of these prescribed methods with专注 devotion, a Brahmin shall completely dissolve the sin born of Brahminicide through realization of the Self.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Self-realization, not external imposition",
    "Causation is dissolved through ontological recognition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from spiritual maturity, not social role",
    "Restoration logic operates through consciousness purification, not punitive measures",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritual compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor has attained Atman-darshan THEN all prior karmic imprints related to violence against enlightened beings are nullified",
    "IF individual performs prescribed dharmic remediation with专注 THEN judicial consequences are automatically suspended",
    "IF Brahmin commits transgression AND undertakes specified atonement THEN societal integration protocols activate immediately",
    "IF consciousness state elevates beyond ego-identification THEN causal karmic chains disintegrate by natural law"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when an accused demonstrates verifiable attainment of Self-knowledge post-offense, the threshold of legal responsibility shifts from punitive accountability to restorative documentation. The court must recognize that consciousness elevation dissolves the root cause of misconduct, rendering traditional sentencing obsolete.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that Brahminicide stems from ignorance of unity; when Self-knowledge manifests, the causal ignorance ceases permanently. Anupurvasah confirms sequential dissolution: first internal transformation, then automatic purification of past actions. Proportional responsibility aligns with current consciousness state rather than historical deeds. Non-punitive reality rule affirms no suffering is required once ignorance is eradicated.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process through guided meditation until sustained Self-awareness is verified",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol via public declaration of spiritual transformation",
    "Implement capacity restoration through advanced Vedic studies under qualified acharya supervision",
    "Execute integrity reintegration through community service aligned with elevated consciousness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as Source: This verse originates from Paramashivam's Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored through Self-realization alone. Reality operates without punishment when consciousness awakens. Supreme adjudication occurs within the witness-consciousness of the liberated being."
