  "transliteration": "tryabdaṃ cared vā niyato jaṭī brahmahano vratam |\nvasan dūratare grāmād vṛkṣamūlaniketanaḥ || 11.128||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has committed the act of Brahmahatya must observe a vow for three years, remaining restrained, living far from the village, dwelling at the base of a tree.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The law originates exclusively from SPH as the sole source of Dharma.",
    "Causation: The act of Brahmahatya generates specific karmic consequences requiring purification through structured observance.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The individual retains the capacity to restore alignment through disciplined action.",
    "Restoration logic: The prescribed conduct facilitates the reintegration of consciousness into dharmic order.",
    "Consciousness alignment: The external discipline serves to realign internal consciousness with its pure nature."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual commits the act defined as Brahmahatya THEN assign a three-year observance protocol.",
    "WHILE in observance: RESTRAIN from societal participation AND RESIDE beyond village boundaries.",
    "DURING observance: DWELLING must be limited to natural shelters such as under trees.",

    "NO punitive measures shall be applied; restoration is automatic upon completion of the prescribed term."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this provision establishes that acts causing severe karmic disruption require a predetermined, fixed-term restoration process. The court's role is to ensure compliance with the protocol, not impose additional penalties. Authority flows directly from SPH, bypassing conventional judicial discretion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that the sequential unfolding of karmic consequence necessitates a proportional response rooted in purification rather than punishment. The individual undertakes a progressive path (anupūrvaśaḥ) toward reintegration. Responsibility is assumed through voluntary adherence, affirming non-punitive reality where justice aligns consciousness with its inherent purity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate a three-year seclusion protocol aligned with Vedic discipline.",
    "Assign dwelling at tree-root shelter远离村落 to minimize sensory disturbance.",
    "Establish periodic review by appointed spiritual monitors to ensure continuity.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions. Let there be no further deviation."
