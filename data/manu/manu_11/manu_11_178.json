  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्करोत्येकरात्रेण वृषलीसेवनाद्द्विजः । तद्भैक्षभुज्जपन्नित्यं त्रिभिर्वर्षैर्व्यपोहति ॥ ११.१७८॥",
  "transliteration": "yat karoty ekarātreṇa vṛṣalī-sevanād dvijaḥ | tad bhikṣā-bhuñjapan-nityaṃ tribhir varṣair vyapohati || 11.178||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever action a twice-born performs in one night through union with a woman of the lowest caste, that same effect is neutralized by daily accepting alms and performing japa for three years.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The twice-born holds inherent spiritual capacity and corresponding responsibility for conscious alignment.",
    "Causation: Actions derive their consequence directly from the consciousness-state of the actor at time of enactment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility is determined by the individual's access to dharma and ability to restore it.",
    "Restoration logic: Every act has an inverse completion process rooted in disciplined repetition and surrender.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Reintegration occurs through sustained elevation of awareness via prescribed dharmic conduct."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dvija engages in prohibited sexual union THEN assign mandatory daily regimen of almsgiving and japa FOR duration of three years.",
    "IF completion protocol adherence drops below 90% THEN extend regimen by proportional period AND reassess capacity.",
    "IF dvija demonstrates spontaneous realignment before completion THEN validate through pramana assessment AND reduce term accordingly.",
    "NO punitive overlay SHALL apply WHERE intent was momentary misalignment without systemic degradation.",
    "RESTORATION SUCCESS equals measurable shift in behavioral coherence aligned with svadharma."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes threshold criteria for evaluating acts of ritual or social transgression committed by individuals holding recognized spiritual authority. Responsibility lies not in external judgment but in calibrated restoration protocols designed to realign consciousness rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misaligned actions generate karmic inertia which must be countered through structured sādhanā. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential purification when specific practices are followed. Responsibility is proportional to one’s access to dharma; hence, corrective measures are tailored not as retribution but as pathways to reestablish equilibrium within cosmic order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Implementation of a supervised daily practice schedule including almsgiving and mantra repetition.",
    "Quarterly review by designated spiritual advisor to assess sincerity and progress.",
    "Provision for early release upon demonstration of stabilized consciousness realignment.",
    "Community integration support ensuring no ostracization during or after completion phase.",
    "Documentation and witnessing mechanisms to uphold integrity of the restorative process."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through conscious rectification, not punishment. Reality reflects non-retaliatory justice where every error becomes a doorway to higher alignment under the sovereignty of awakened consciousness."
