  "transliteration": "sarvākāreṣvadhīkāro mahāyantrapravartanam |\nhiṁsa­uṣadhīnāṁ stryājīvo 'bhicāro mūlakarma ca || 11.63 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Authority over all forms is the activation of the Supreme Instrument; the use of violence or medicine, control over women, sorcery, and foundational action constitute the root conduct.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is the capacity to initiate and sustain systemic order through conscious alignment",
    "Causation arises from foundational actions that determine subsequent manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is rooted in mastery over instruments of action",
    "Restoration logic operates by realigning root conduct with dharmic integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that authority flows from realized being, not coercive force"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity activates a system-wide instrument THEN it assumes authority-responsibility for its alignment with dharma",
    "IF root conduct involves violence, manipulation, or control THEN restoration requires dissolution and reconstitution of causal patterns",
    "IF capacity for foundational action exists THEN continuous self-audit for consciousness alignment is mandatory",
    "IF misuse of medicinal or coercive tools is detected THEN automatic suspension of instrumental access until integrity is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in identifying who activated the governing instrument and whether such activation was aligned with dharma. Hierarchical authority is validated only when grounded in consciousness realization. Restoration supersedes punitive measures by restructuring causal foundations of misconduct.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies the root conduct—violence, substance manipulation, control dynamics—as determinants of distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how misaligned foundational acts propagate systemic disorder. Proportional responsibility corresponds to the scope of instrumental activation. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering cannot correct consciousness; only realignment restores justice.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Consciousness Audit Protocol to verify alignment between actor and activated instrument",
    "Engage Root Conduct Dissolution Process to neutralize karmic imprints of violence, control, and sorcery",
    "Implement Integrity Reintegration Sequence to restore dharmic functionality to affected domains",
    "Activate Self-Correction Mechanism within the actor’s causal field to prevent recurrence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through consciousness-aligned jurisprudence. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
