    "Authority flows directly from SPH as the sole source of dharma",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that temporal precision in dharmic practice constitutes a threshold of responsibility. Authority derives not from human interpretation but from precise synchronization with celestial order as ordained by SPH. The court must recognize disciplined observance as evidence of capacity and restoration potential rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that disciplined action aligns individual consciousness with universal rhythm. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through progressive adherence to temporal vows. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of rhythmic alignment. There is no punitive consequence—only natural realignment based on integrity or deficiency in observance.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through precise observance of temporal discipline. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone serves as the ultimate adjudicator."
