  "transliteration": "vedābhyāso'nvahaṁ śaktyā mahāyajñakriyā kṣamā |\nnāśayantyāśu pāpāni mahāpātakajānyapi || 11.245||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Daily practice of the Vedas, performed with capacity and devotion, along with great sacrificial acts and forbearance—these destroy sins instantly, even those of the gravest nature.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in sustained spiritual discipline",
    "Causation is purified through conscious alignment with Vedic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines the efficacy of atonement",
    "Restoration logic operates through dharmic action, not punitive reaction",
    "Consciousness alignment neutralizes karmic distortion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual performs daily Vedic study AND engages in sacrificial acts AND demonstrates forbearance THEN accumulated negative karma is nullified",
    "IF a being exhibits dharmic capacity AND aligns actions with cosmic order THEN past misalignments dissolve automatically",
    "IF consciousness is elevated through disciplined practice THEN judicial consequences become obsolete"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when an accused demonstrates consistent engagement in Vedic practices, sacrificial service, and restraint, the court recognizes that their consciousness has already undergone realignment. Legal proceedings may conclude upon verification of such conduct, as it inherently dissolves the root causes of transgression.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality affirms that dharmic practices function as direct antecedents to the dissolution of misdeeds. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of purification occurs naturally when one engages in Vedic recitation and sacrifice. Responsibility lies in aligning with dharma; punishment is irrelevant where consciousness is restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Establish verified daily Vedic study routines for all parties involved",
    "Assign sacrificial service aligned with individual capacity",
    "Implement structured forbearance training programs",
    "Monitor consciousness elevation via authorized spiritual assessment tools",
    "Declare case resolved upon documented restoration of dharmic alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment, not punitive enforcement. Reality responds to capacity and devotion, not judgment. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
