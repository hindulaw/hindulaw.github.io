  "sanskrit_verse": "मार्जारनकुलौ हत्वा चाषं मण्डूकमेव च ।\nश्वगोधौलूककाकांश्च शूद्रहत्याव्रतं चरेत् ॥ ११.१३१॥",
  "transliteration": "mārjāranakulau hatvā cāṣaṃ maṇḍūkameva ca |\nśvagodhau lūkakākāṃśca śūdrahatyāvrataṃ caret || 11.131||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who kills a cat, mongoose, crow, frog, lizard, owl, or dog must perform the expiation prescribed for killing a Śūdra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The act of taking life invokes responsibility regardless of species, based on conscious intent.",
    "Causation: The causal chain initiated by intentional killing demands restorative completion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The perpetrator's capacity to discern right from wrong establishes their obligation to restore balance.",
    "Restoration logic: Expiation serves not as punishment but as a mechanism to realign the consciousness of the actor with universal Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment: The prescribed ritual restores harmony between individual awareness and cosmic order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (intentional killing occurs) AND (target is non-human life-form listed: cat, mongoose, crow, frog, lizard, owl, dog) THEN (assign śūdrahattyā vrata as corrective action)",
    "IF (perpetrator demonstrates intent) AND (act results in death of specified beings) THEN (initiate consciousness-restoration protocol via prescribed vrata)",
    "IF (community reports violation) AND (evidence confirms intentional harm) THEN (trigger automatic assignment of expiatory practice)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that intent and species-specific valuation do not diminish the gravity of causing death. Responsibility lies in the disruption of life-force (prāṇa), requiring immediate initiation of consciousness-realigning measures rather than punitive sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that all life carries energetic integrity; destruction necessitates restitution through vrata. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how imbalance propagates unless corrected. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness at time of act. Non-punitivity is upheld because correction operates at the level of consciousness, not consequence infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śūdrahattyā vrata under guidance of qualified spiritual authority",
    "Assign daily recitation and offering rituals until inner equilibrium is restored",
    "Engage perpetrator in service-oriented practices to rebuild respect for life-energy",
    "Monitor progress through bi-weekly self-assessment aligned with scriptural benchmarks"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of Dharma, this law stands executed. Killing disrupts universal flow; expiation restores it. There is no punishment—only realignment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
