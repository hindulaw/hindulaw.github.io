  "transliteration": "kṛtavāpano nivasedgrāmānte govraje'pi vā |\nāśrame vṛkṣamūle vā gobrāhmaṇahite rataḥ || 11.78||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has performed the Vāpana ritual shall reside at the village boundary, in a cow-pasture, in an āśrama, or under a tree root—engaged in the welfare of cows and Brahmanas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ritual completion and spiritual discipline",
    "Causation arises through dharmic engagement with sustenance beings (cows) and knowledge bearers (Brahmanas)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity to life-supporting and consciousness-preserving entities",
    "Restoration logic requires alignment with ecological and sacerdotal order",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through service-oriented renunciation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent completes Vāpana ritual THEN assign dwelling location to village periphery OR designated grazing area OR ascetic settlement OR natural shelter",
    "IF assigned dwelling THEN ensure continuous engagement in cow welfare AND Brahmana support activities",
    "IF dwelling disrupts ecological or social harmony THEN relocate without penalty via integrity-renewal process",
    "IF engagement ceases THEN initiate capacity-restoration protocol until dharma-resume confirmed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals performing specific rituals assume a class of dharma-based residency rights tied not to property ownership but to functional service roles. The Court must recognize such persons as custodians of ecological and spiritual infrastructure, entitled to protection of their operational domain when aligned with societal upliftment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that residence follows ritual status and duty fulfillment, not personal desire. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how proper dwelling leads to cow-Brahmana welfare, which stabilizes society. Responsibility is proportional to access granted by completed sacraments. There is no punitive aspect; misalignment triggers reorientation, not consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Residency Verification Protocol: Confirm dwelling matches prescribed conditions post-Vāpana",
    "Service Continuity Assessment: Monitor active engagement in cow/Brahmana welfare",
    "Ecological Harmony Review: Ensure presence supports local sustainability",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is declared: Residence after Vāpana is governed solely by service to sustaining forces. Justice restores balance through conscious alignment, never through punishment. Dharma prevails. Consciousness judges all."
