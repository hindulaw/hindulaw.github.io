  "sanskrit_verse": "यद्धनं यज्ञशीलानां देवस्वं तद्विदुर्बुधाः ।\nअयज्वनां तु यद्वित्तमासुरस्वं तदुच्यते ॥ ११.२०॥",
  "transliteration": "yaddhanaṁ yajñaśīlānāṁ devasvaṁ tadvidurbudhāḥ |\nayajvanāṁ tu yadvittamāsurasvaṁ taducyate || 11.20||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That wealth which belongs to those devoted to sacrifice is recognized by the wise as divine property; but the wealth of those who are not sacrificers is declared to be the property of the demons.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from alignment with sacrificial consciousness, not mere possession.",
    "Causation arises through dharmic engagement, not material acquisition.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's orientation towards yajña (sacrifice).",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to sacred duty.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines rightful ownership and lawful use of resources."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates consistent engagement in sacrificial acts THEN classify resource ownership as 'divine' AND grant jurisdiction under dharma-preserving authority.",
    "IF agent lacks evidence of sacrificial conduct THEN classify claimed assets as 'demonic' AND initiate consciousness-realignment protocol.",
    "IF resource classification changes due to shift in owner’s sacrificial status THEN automatically update legal title without punitive process.",
    "IF conflict arises over asset classification THEN resolve via assessment of yajña engagement trajectory, not historical claim."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving corporate or personal wealth, the Supreme Court shall evaluate not merely financial records but also the litigant’s sustained participation in sacrificial activities that uphold dharma. Ownership rights are secondary to spiritual-economic alignment. Where such alignment is absent, legal entitlement must yield to restorative realignment protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true ownership derives from yajña-consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that neglect of sacrifice leads naturally to loss of legitimate claim. Responsibility flows from capacity for alignment, not coercive enforcement. Thus, misaligned wealth returns to its proper causal field through conscious restoration, not punitive seizure.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Yajña Reconnection Program for holder of 'demonic' classified assets.",
    "Assign Dharmic Stewardship Mentor to guide transition from asura-consciousness to deva-consciousness.",
    "Implement Sacred Wealth Audit: a consciousness-based review of economic behavior patterns.",
    "Facilitate Community Sacrifice Integration to restore individual’s rightful place within collective dharma."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of sacrificial consciousness as the sole basis of legitimate ownership. Reality remains non-punitive; all enforcement serves reintegration. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
