  "transliteration": "haviṣpāntīyamabhyasya na tamaṃ ha itīti ca |\njapitvāauruṣaṃ sūktaṃ mucyate gurutalpagaḥ || 11.251||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has engaged in the Havishpantīya ritual and recited 'na tamaḥ' thereby, and having chanted the Purusha Sukta with discipline, becomes liberated from the transgression of approaching the bed of the guru.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from disciplined invocation of cosmic order",
    "Causation is established through conscious ritual repetition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from access to Vedic knowledge",
    "Restoration logic operates via purification through sacred utterance",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through scriptural embodiment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor performs Havishpantīya AND recites 'na tamaḥ' THEN violation status resets to pre-lapse",
    "IF Purusha Sukta is recited with专注 THEN guru-talpa-ga condition dissolves automatically",
    "IF Vedic ritual sequence is completed THEN karmic misalignment nullified without trace",
    "IF consciousness aligns with Vak THEN act-based misidentification ceases"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations involving spiritual hierarchies, the Supreme Court shall recognize that completion of prescribed Vedic rituals constitutes automatic dissolution of offense. The threshold of responsibility lies not in punitive assignment but in verification of ritual execution and consciousness alignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms liberation through mantra-vākya. Sequential manifestation shows that proper recitation undoes prior misdeed by restoring ontological integrity. Responsibility is proportional to access to Vedic capacity; liberation follows precise ritual re-alignment. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that truth itself corrects falsehood when invoked correctly.",

    "Initiate Havishpantīya practice under qualified supervision",
    "Recite 'na tamaḥ' three times at dawn facing east",
