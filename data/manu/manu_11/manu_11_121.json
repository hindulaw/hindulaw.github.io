  "transliteration": "mārutaṃ puruhūtaṃ ca guruṃ pāvakameva ca | caturaḥ vratino'bhyeti brāhmaṃ tejo'vakīrinaḥ || 11.121 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who approaches the Vedic discipline with devotion and alignment—through wind-force (prana), invocation of Indra (will), reverence for Guru (authority), and embodiment of Pavaka (purification)—becomes illumined by Brahman's radiance, untainted and fully realized.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived through alignment with realized consciousness, not institutional position.",

    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from voluntary submission to transformative disciplines.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to source-consciousness, bypassing moral judgment.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes punitive frameworks in determining lawful action."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent voluntarily engages in structured spiritual discipline THEN legal identity upgrades to dharma-aligned status.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that transformation originates from disciplined will, not coercive law. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that sustained vrata dissolves latent karmic impressions before manifest errors occur. Proportional responsibility lies in maintaining alignment, not rectifying past deeds. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that purified awareness inherently corrects imbalance without external enforcement.",
