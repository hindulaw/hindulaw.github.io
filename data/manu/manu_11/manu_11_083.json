  "transliteration": "dharmasya brāhmaṇo mūlamagraṃ rājanya ucyate |\ntasmātsamāgame teṣāmeno vikhyāpya śudhyati || 11.83||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The foundation of Dharma is established by the Brāhmaṇa; the Kshatriya is declared its protector and executor. Therefore, when both unite in purpose and action, all impurities of conduct are revealed and purified through conscious alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma-rooted consciousness, not institutional power",
    "Causation flows from the integrity of foundational roles within societal structure",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mutual activation between knowledge-bearers and protectors",
    "Restoration logic operates through revelation and purification, not punitive correction",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes procedural formalism in determining lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves violation of foundational dharmic order THEN initiate joint inquiry by designated Brāhmaṇa-Kshatriya authority pair",
    "IF conflicting parties belong to foundational varṇas THEN mandatory disclosure protocol precedes resolution mechanism",
    "IF misalignment detected in foundational role THEN automatic invocation of purification process over punitive measures",
    "IF consensus achieved between Brāhmaṇa and Kshatriya THEN case closure based on declared purity status",
    "IF no foundational alignment present THEN escalate to next higher consciousness-integrity tribunal"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, matters concerning constitutional foundations or breaches of core societal dharma must involve dual testimony from recognized Brāhmaṇa and Kshatriya representatives. Their unified declaration determines the threshold of responsibility and initiates either purification or integration pathways without recourse to punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that error arises from disconnection between foundational roles. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential breakdown in alignment, leading to visible impurity. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring connection rather than assigning blame. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that true justice occurs only upon purification through conscious re-alignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Samāgama Sākshi Process – joint witnessing by Brāhmaṇa-Kshatriya authorities",
    "Activate Enahooda Prakāśana Vidhi – transparent exposure of misaligned actions for self-recognition",
    "Implement Śuddhi Samāropaṇa Ācaraṇa – ritualized reintegration following acknowledgment",
    "Establish Dharmapada Punarsthāpana – reaffirmation of foundational duties before community council",
    "Execute Antarātman Margadarśana – guided introspective correction under spiritual-legal mentorship"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. All impurity dissolves through alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates eternally."
