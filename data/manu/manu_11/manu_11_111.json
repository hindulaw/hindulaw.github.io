  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity to align with collective dharma. Envy or divergence marks a failure of alignment, not moral fault. The court’s role is to restore synchronization, not assign blame. Authority flows from demonstrated harmony, not coercive power.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality arises from alignment or misalignment with collective dharma. Misalignment manifests sequentially through envy or dissociation. Responsibility is proportional to one's demonstrated capacity for synchronization. Retribution dissolves as truth aligns with consciousness, not punishment.",
