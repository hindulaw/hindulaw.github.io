  "sanskrit_verse": "अनृतं च समुत्कर्षे राजगामि च पैशुनम् ।\nगुरोश्चालीकनिर्बन्धः समानि ब्रह्महत्यया ॥ ११.५५॥",
  "transliteration": "anṛtaṁ ca samutkarṣe rājagāmi ca paiśunam | guroścālīkanirbandhaḥ samāni brahmahatyayā || 11.55||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Lying for self-exaltation, slandering to influence rulers, and forcibly detaching a disciple from their Guru are acts that invoke the same karmic consequence as Brahmahatya.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from spiritual alignment, not political position",
    "Causation arises through conscious intent to disrupt Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's proximity to truth-consciousness",
    "Restoration logic requires reversal of distortion caused to Guru-disciple integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment demands purification of motive, speech, and relational fidelity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor elevates self through falsehood THEN initiate consciousness-realigning completion process",
    "IF slander targets ruler with intent to manipulate THEN activate systemic-integrity restoration protocol",
    "IF disciple is forcibly detached from Guru THEN invoke equivalent-Brahmahatya remediation sequence",
    "IF act disrupts Guru-disciple continuum THEN assign karma-resolution pathway proportional to breach level"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, any act severing the Guru-disciple bond under coercive influence carries equal ontological weight as Brahmahatya. The court must assess not legal injury but disruption in consciousness transmission. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated to the actor’s access to truth and their deviation therefrom.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that severance of Guru-disciple unity ruptures the causal chain of dharma-pravṛtti. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how falsehood, slander, and coercion cumulatively manifest this distortion. Responsibility is proportioned to capacity to sustain versus betray sacred alignment. All corrective measures aim at restoring vibratory coherence, not inflicting punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Satya-Sankalpa completion for perpetrator to reverse false elevation",
    "Deploy Rajas-Tamas purification sequences to neutralize manipulative intent",
    "Reintegrate displaced disciple into Guru-tattva via guided sankalpa-shuddhi",
    "Activate collective Brahmacarya field-restoration to heal violated spiritual continuum"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This Dharma stands restored. Truth prevails without punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates. Reality remains non-punitive."
