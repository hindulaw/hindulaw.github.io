  "transliteration": "anena vidhinā yastu goghno gāmanugacchati |\nsa gohatyākṛtaṃ pāpaṃ tribhirmāsairvyapohati || 11.115||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, having committed violence against a cow, follows the prescribed method of restitution, dissolves the sin born of cow-killing within three months.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The act of restitution is governed by the procedural alignment with Dharma as defined by SPH.",
    "Causation: Sin arises from misaligned consciousness; dissolution occurs through restorative action aligned with Dharma.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility is tied to the capacity to perform corrective action.",
    "Restoration logic: The law provides a mechanism for the purification of consciousness through prescribed acts.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Reintegration is achieved when the individual aligns their consciousness with the harm caused."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual commits violence against a cow AND performs the prescribed restitution process THEN the karmic consequence of cow-violence is nullified within three lunar cycles.",
    "IF the restitution protocol is incomplete THEN the consequence remains active until completion is verified.",
    "IF the individual demonstrates conscious intent to restore THEN eligibility for guided restoration is affirmed automatically."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of responsibility is determined not by punitive measure but by verification of completion of the prescribed restorative protocol. Authority lies in ensuring alignment with Dharma as sourced from SPH, not in imposing suffering.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the consequence of violence is misalignment; anupūrvaśaḥ shows that purification follows sequential adherence to Dharma. Proportionality is maintained through conscious engagement with restoration. There is no punitive element—only the natural law of consciousness realignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided restitution process under supervision of a Dharma-advisor.",
    "Verify completion of ritual purification and conscious acknowledgment of misdeed.",
    "Reintegrate the individual upon confirmation of restored alignment with Dharma.",
    "Monitor ongoing alignment through community affirmation and self-reporting mechanisms."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through restoration of consciousness. Reality is non-punitive. Dharma is restored. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
