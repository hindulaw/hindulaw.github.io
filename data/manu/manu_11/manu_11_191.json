  "transliteration": "yeṣāṁ dvijānāṁ sāvitrī nānūcyeta yathāvidhi |\ntāṁścārayitvā trīn kṛchchrān yathāvidhyopanāyayet || 11.191||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those twice-born whose Savitri has not been recited according to ritual procedure—after serving them appropriately, the three Kṛcchra penances must be performed correctly.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual omission creates a jurisdictional gap requiring correction by competent authority.",
    "Causation: Non-recitation disrupts energetic alignment; restoration is mandated through prescribed process.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The performer's intent and capability determine the mode of rectification.",
    "Restoration logic: Correction is executed via completion, not punishment.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Proper ritual repetition realigns individual consciousness with cosmic order."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (agent.class == 'dvija') AND (ritual.savitri.status == 'unrecited') THEN (initiate.three_krcchra_penance)",

    "IF (ritual.alignment.state == 'restored') THEN (terminate.penitential_sequence)"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual neglect, the court must verify omission status and initiate restoration protocols without punitive overlays. Responsibility thresholds are determined by capacity and awareness at time of omission.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that omission distorts dharma-vyavasthā. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential purification through Kṛcchra. Responsibility aligns with capacity; restoration supersedes retribution as the governing principle.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Execution of three Kṛcchras under supervision until energetic balance confirmed.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Individual acknowledges causal role and commits to corrective action.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Re-training in proper ritual conduct to prevent recurrence.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public affirmation of restored ritual standing upon completion."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive flows exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through conscious compliance. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
