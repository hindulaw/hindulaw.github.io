  "transliteration": "gomūtraṁ gomayaṁ kṣīraṁ dadhi sarpiḥ kuśodakam |\nekarātropavāsaśca kṛcchraṁ sāntapanaṁ smṛtam || 11.212||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Consumption of cow urine, cow dung, milk, curd, ghee, and water sanctified with kuśa grass, along with a single night's fast, constitutes the Kṛcchra Sāntapana penance as ordained for purification and consciousness realignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from SPH as the sole source of dharma",
    "Causation is traced through conscious impurity and its remedial alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires embodied purification protocols",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential completion of purificatory acts",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via ritualized sensory and dietary regulation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits conscious misalignment THEN initiate prescribed purification protocol",
    "IF purification incomplete THEN extend observance until capacity for integrity is restored",
    "IF agent assumes responsibility THEN execute Kṛcchra Sāntapana without punitive attribution",
    "IF societal harmony disrupted THEN apply penance as consciousness-realigning mechanism",
    "IF completion verified by competent authority THEN declare restoration enacted"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that conscious misconduct must be addressed through purification rites rather than punitive measures. The court must ensure that the prescribed regimen is administered under qualified supervision and verified for completion before declaring restoration. No civil or criminal penalties shall attach to the performance of such penances.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This provision aligns with pramāṇa-based causality wherein impurities arise from misaligned consciousness, requiring sequential remediation through purified substances and disciplined restraint. It reflects anupūrvaśaḥ — the progressive unfolding of purification effects. Responsibility is proportional to awareness, and the remedy serves reintegration rather than retribution.",

    "Initiate supervised consumption of prescribed purifying substances",
    "Enforce single-night fast as sensory reset mechanism",
    "Verify completion through attestation by qualified spiritual authority",

    "Maintain registry of completion for future integrity validation"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. This law restores purity through conscious action, affirms non-punitive justice, and upholds reality as governed by consciousness alone."
