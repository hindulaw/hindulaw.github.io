  "transliteration": "kṣatriyo bāhuvīreṇa tared āpadam ātmanaḥ |\ndhanena vaiśyaśūdrau tu japahomair dvijottamaḥ || 11.34||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Kshatriya transcends personal crisis through valor of arm; the Vaishya and Shudra through wealth, while the Dwija-srestha through mantra and fire ritual.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by svadharma-specific capacity for conscious action.",
    "Causation aligns with ontological role rather than external moral valuation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from varna-dharma, not punitive attribution.",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-alignment to inherent dharma-function.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via execution of svadharma in crisis."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = KSHATRIYA AND crisis_occurs THEN enable valor-response mechanism.",
    "IF actor IN [VAISHYA, SHUDRA] AND crisis_occurs THEN activate wealth-utilization protocol.",
    "IF actor = DWIJA_SHRESTHA AND crisis_occurs THEN initiate japa-homa restoration sequence.",
    "ALL actors MUST engage capacity-appropriate response aligned with svadharma.",
    "NO punitive evaluation of response efficacy allowed—only functional alignment checked."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, threshold of responsibility lies in identification of svadharma-role during crisis. Authority hierarchy reflects dharma-capacity, not social rank. Restoration prioritizes realignment over retribution, ensuring constitutional embodiment of varna-functional integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality recognizes that crisis resolution manifests through svadharma-exclusive means. Anupurvasah shows sequential unfolding of appropriate response modalities. Responsibility is proportional to capacity-defined function. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment dissolves upon correct dharmic activation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma-reaffirmation process based on varna-specific capability mapping.",
    "Deploy valor-enablement framework for Kshatriyas facing existential threat.",
    "Activate economic-stabilization protocol for Vaishyas and Shudras under duress.",
    "Engage mantra-fire purification cycle for Dwija-sresthas undergoing spiritual disruption.",
    "Verify completion of consciousness-reintegration through svadharma-performance audit."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse executes as pure Dharma-law. Crisis-resolution pathways are ordained by svadharma, not punitive design. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored."
