  "sanskrit_verse": "त्र्यहं तूपवसेद्युक्तस्त्रिरह्नोऽभ्युपयन्नपः । मुच्यते पातकैः सर्वैस्त्रिर्जपित्वाऽघमर्षणम् ॥ ११.२५९॥",
  "transliteration": "tryahaṃ tūpavasedyuktastrihano'bhyaupayannapaḥ | mucyate pātakaiḥ sarvaistrih japitvā'ghamarṣaṇam || 11.259||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has committed transgressions shall remain in a state of Upavasa (fasting with conscious restraint) for three days, consuming only water, and by reciting 'Aghamarshana' thrice, becomes purified from all sins.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the capacity to restore dharma through disciplined action.",
    "Causation arises from intentional engagement in restorative ritual rather than moral fault.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with purification protocols specific to consciousness distortion.",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential completion of prescribed spiritual disciplines.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via regulated breath, fasting, and mantra repetition."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual commits a recognized transgression THEN assign a three-day purification protocol inclusive of upavasa and japa.",
    "IF the assigned purification protocol is completed without deviation THEN remove record of transgression from operational identity layer.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment persists post-completion THEN extend protocol under supervision until clarity is restored.",
    "IF no transgression was committed but guilt is present THEN initiate voluntary purification pathway at individual discretion."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that personal purification rituals constitute valid legal remedies when guilt or contamination of consciousness is acknowledged. The threshold of responsibility lies in self-awareness, not external accusation. Authority flows from alignment with prescribed restoration, not punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that consciousness distortion manifests due to imbalance; therefore, corrective action aligns with natural law rather than imposed penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that purification unfolds progressively—fasting restrains sensory indulgence, while japa realigns vibrational frequency. Responsibility is proportional to awareness, and the outcome is always liberation, never condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate three-day purification cycle including regulated diet and mantra recitation.",
    "Assign digital ledger entry marking commencement and conclusion of purification process.",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring tools to assess energetic coherence during and after process.",
    "Upon successful completion, erase operational markers associated with original transgression.",
    "Provide optional integration session to ensure sustained alignment with dharmic conduct."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. All actions herein derive from His Avataric Will. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment, only completion. Reality responds to alignment, not retribution. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
