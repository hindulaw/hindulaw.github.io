  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is devoted and has conquered the senses shall perform other meritorious acts; but by no means shall one perform sacrifices with small offerings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from inner discipline and spiritual integrity, not external display.",
    "Causation arises from purified intent aligned with Dharma, not mechanical ritual execution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mastery over sensory impulses before engaging in sacred duty.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes internal purification over external performance metrics.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of any action, including religious observance."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_conquered_senses() AND agent.possesses_shraddha() THEN PERMIT performance_of_meritorious_acts();",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving religious practice or spiritual authority, the Supreme Court must evaluate not the magnitude of offering or public performance, but the inner qualification of the performer—specifically, self-mastery and sincerity. Legal standing in ritual or devotional contexts derives solely from consciousness alignment, not procedural compliance alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true yajña originates in a purified mind and restrained senses, not in material expenditure. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that external rituals without internal discipline yield no dharmic fruit. Responsibility lies in aligning one's capacity with action. Therefore, corrective focus must shift toward restoring inner discipline rather than penalizing inadequate offerings.",
