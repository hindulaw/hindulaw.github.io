  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who consumes alkali salt in the fourth mealtime shall perform bathing with cow urine for two months while maintaining sense control.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The regulation of bodily conduct originates from divine constitutional order.",
    "Causation: Disordered ingestion necessitates purification through elemental alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Conduct is governed by one's ability to sustain sensory discipline.",
    "Restoration logic: Ritual cleansing restores physiological and spiritual equilibrium.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purificatory acts realign individual awareness with cosmic dharma."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ingestion_occurrence = 'alkali_salt' AND time_of_day = 'fourth_meal' THEN initiate_purification_protocol(duration='two_months', medium='cow_urine')",

  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving violations of dietary dharmic codes, the Supreme Court shall assess not intent but alignment capacity and execute restoration protocols accordingly. Authority derives exclusively from SPH as constitutional source.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ingestion creates sequential physiological imbalance; thus, purification via gomūtra follows causal necessity. Responsibility aligns with capacity to maintain niyatendriya. No punitive element exists—only sequential restoration.",

    "Initiate supervised gomūtra-snāna protocol for duration of two months",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
