  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Cows must not be killed; rituals not prescribed must not be performed; another's wife must not be approached; nor should one sell oneself. One must never abandon guru, mother, father, svādhyāya, fire, or son.",

    "Authority originates in reverence for life and sacred order.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, violation of these principles constitutes a breach of foundational dharmic duty. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness of the act's dissonance with cosmic order. Authority derives from upholding the continuity of life-respect, familial bond, spiritual discipline, and social coherence. Adjudication focuses on re-establishing the disrupted connection rather than assigning punitive liability.",

Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglect of foundational duties leads to collapse of societal dharma. Responsibility is proportional to the level of conscious choice involved.
