  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brahmin engaged in the Tapta Kṛcchra vow shall consume hot water, milk, ghee, and air every third day, maintaining专注 bathing once and remaining composed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through disciplined self-regulation",
    "Causation via purified sensory intake",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning vows or spiritual disciplines, the threshold of authenticity rests on observance fidelity and consciousness coherence. Authority is hierarchically recognized by adherence to prescribed regimen, not subjective intent. The court must validate or restore alignment without punitive inference.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through observed conformity to elemental consumption and temporal discipline. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential purification of body and mind. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for sustained observance.
