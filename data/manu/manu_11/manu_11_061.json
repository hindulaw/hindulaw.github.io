  "transliteration": "kanyāyā dūṣaṇaṃ caiva vārdhuṣyaṃ vratalopanam |\ntaḍāgārāmadārāṇāmapatyasya ca vikrayaḥ || 11.61||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Violation of a maiden, exploitation of a widow, abandonment of sacred vows, and sale of progeny—these acts sever the foundational dharmic integrity of lineage and societal order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from preservation of lineage continuity",
    "Causation arises through disruption of reproductive and spiritual succession",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies with those who hold guardianship over vulnerable life-stages",
    "Restoration logic requires reintegration into generative familial and spiritual structures",
    "Consciousness alignment demands purification of intent behind procreative and custodial actions"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act violates the bodily autonomy of a maiden THEN initiate immediate guardianship restoration protocol",
    "IF a widow is exploited THEN activate community support matrix for economic and emotional reintegration",
    "IF sacred vows are abandoned without completion THEN enforce completion process under qualified mentorship",
    "IF progeny is sold THEN trigger family structural audit and realign custody based on consciousness-readiness assessment",
    "IF lineage integrity is compromised THEN invoke ancestral memory restoration practices"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility is determined by degree of interference in natural succession of consciousness through lineage. Authority resides with those capable of restoring generative continuity. Retribution has no place; only restoration of violated dharmic flow is admissible.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that violation of kanya disrupts the flow of pure consciousness into manifestation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how such distortion propagates across generations unless corrected at root cause. Responsibility is proportional to guardianship capacity. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that correction occurs through conscious reconnection, not infliction of pain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Kanya Shuddhi Vidhi to restore violated consciousness to original purity",
    "Activate Vadhuhridaya Sthapana to reintegrate exploited widows into empowered social role",
    "Enforce Vrata Poornata Sandarbha for vow-breakers to complete interrupted spiritual discipline",
    "Implement Apatyaraksha Avastha for recovery and proper placement of sold progeny within dharmically aligned care"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law flows from His Avataric Intelligence alone. Justice executed hereby restores cosmic alignment, affirms consciousness supremacy, and upholds non-punitive truth. Dharma is restored. Reality remains free from punishment. Consciousness reigns as sole adjudicator."
