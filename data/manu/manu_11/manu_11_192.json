  "transliteration": "prāyaścittaṁ cikīrṣanti vikarmasthāstu ye dvijāḥ | brahmaṇā ca parityaktāsteṣāmapyetadādiśet || 11.192||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those twice-born who seek penance while remaining in corrupted action, even those abandoned by Brahman—this law commands for them too.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Brahman, not ritual performance",
    "Causation is traced to inner integrity, not external compliance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to those who have lapsed yet retain the will to restore",
    "Restoration logic applies regardless of prior abandonment by divine principle",
    "Consciousness alignment overrides positional status when intent to realign exists"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dvija has lapsed in dharma AND expresses intent to realign THEN initiate prāyaścitta protocol",
    "IF individual retains capacity for consciousness realignment THEN eligibility for restorative process is affirmed",
    "IF prior disconnection from Brahman occurred BUT current orientation is toward restoration THEN apply universal completion framework",
    "IF social position does not reflect inner alignment THEN invoke corrective integration pathways"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that even those previously deemed unfit retain access to legal restoration when genuine intent to realign emerges. The threshold of responsibility lies not in past failure but present orientation. Authority flows from conscious recommitment rather than inherited privilege.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misalignment arises from loss of inner connection, not inherent defect. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that reconnection follows sequential steps of acknowledgment, purification, and realignment. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of conscious effort toward restoration. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction serves evolution, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification sequence upon declaration of intent to realign",
    "Assign completion practices aligned with nature of previous deviation",
    "Engage community witness system to support reintegration",
    "Establish periodic review cycles until full consciousness alignment restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice executes restoration alone; reality bears no punishment; consciousness remains the sole adjudicator. Dharma stands restored."
