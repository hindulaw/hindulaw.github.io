  "sanskrit_verse": "क्रव्यादांस्तु मृगान् हत्वा धेनुं दद्यात्पयस्विनीम् ।\nअक्रव्यादान् वत्सतरीमुष्ट्रं हत्वा तु कृष्णलम् ॥ ११.१३७॥",
  "transliteration": "kravyādāṃstu mṛgān hatvā dhenuṃ dadyātpayasvinīm |\nakravyādān vatsatarīmuṣṭraṃ hatvā tu kṛṣṇalam || 11.137||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who consumes flesh must, upon taking the life of a deer, offer in return a milk-giving cow; one who abstains from flesh, having slain a she-calf or a donkey, shall give a black bull.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through action-responsibility symmetry",
    "Causation is tied to consumption and its sacrificial balance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with dietary choice and ritual consequence",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional energetic compensation",
    "Consciousness alignment requires offering that sustains life-force"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent consumes meat AND kills deer THEN obligation = provide lactating cow",
    "IF agent abstains from meat AND kills calf OR donkey THEN obligation = provide black bull",
    "Obligation type determined by consumption status at time of act",
    "Restitution value mapped to life-sustaining capacity of returned offering",
    "Non-compliance triggers consciousness-realignment protocol until completion"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating acts involving animal life-taking, the court must determine the actor's habitual dietary pattern as determinant of restitution class. The hierarchy of offerings reflects ontological valuation of life-force sustaining potential. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated not by species killed but by the metabolic and spiritual exchange enacted through reciprocal giving.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality between ingestion and sacrifice; anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequential necessity of compensatory offering. Responsibility is proportionate to the agent’s sustained engagement with the life-energy cycle. No punitive intent inheres—only completion of the causal loop necessary for cosmic integrity and individual purification.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate prāṇa-pratipūraṇa process until correct offering is made",
    "Deploy śuddhi-vyavasthāpana council to oversee transfer of restitution",
    "Activate antaḥkaraṇa-parīkṣa protocol for consciousness recalibration",
    "Implement yajña-saṃskāra completion rite post-offering"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law restores Dharma through reciprocal offering, aligning action with consciousness, affirming non-punitivity, and establishing reality as governed solely by causal completion under the eternal jurisdiction of awakened awareness."
