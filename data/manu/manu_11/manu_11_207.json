  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who causes bloodshed that stains the earth with dust shall dwell in Naraka for as many thousand years as there are particles of dust thus stained.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with conscious causality, not coercive force",
    "Causation is determined by sequential manifestation rooted in consciousness distortion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from intentional violation of Dharma’s integrity field",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional experiential completion aligned with causal distortion",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates experiential recalibration through non-punitive dissolution of distorted identity structures"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action results in śoṇita-staining-of-earth THEN initiate karmic-duration-calculation BASED ON dust-particle-count",
    "IF duration-calculated THEN enforce naraka-residence-period EQUAL TO particle-count-in-thousands-of-years",
    "IF residence-period-active THEN deploy consciousness-rehabilitation-protocols TO restore causal-integrity",
    "IF causal-integrity-restored THEN terminate naraka-phase AND enable reintegration-readiness-assessment"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of irreversible environmental-violence-based karma-accounting where intent and consequence coalesce into measurable energetic distortion requiring calibrated experiential correction rather than punitive incarceration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that each stained particle reflects a disruption in universal harmony; anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential karmic experience aligns exactly with causal distortion without inflicting gratuitous suffering; proportional responsibility is maintained via experiential mirroring而非外在制裁；非惩罚性现实法则确认所有经历皆为意识重构过程。",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate karmic resonance calibration to align experiential duration with causal magnitude",
    "Deploy consciousness rehabilitation sequences during naraka phase to dissolve identification with violence",
    "Activate prarabdha-karma integration post-naraka to support dharmic reorientation",
    "Establish samskaric purification pathways to prevent recurrence of causally-distorted patterns"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through precise alignment of causality and consciousness. Reality operates beyond punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
