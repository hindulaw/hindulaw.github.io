  "sanskrit_verse": "निन्दितेभ्यो धनादानं वाणिज्यं शूद्रसेवनम् ।\nअपात्रीकरणं ज्ञेयमसत्यस्य च भाषणम् ॥ ११.६९॥",
  "transliteration": "ninditebhyo dhanādānaṃ vāṇijyaṃ śūdrasevanam | apātrīkaraṇaṃ jñeyamasatyasya ca bhāṣaṇam || 11.69 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Accepting gifts from those who are condemned, engaging in trade, serving śūdras, and speaking untruth—these acts constitute the loss of one's entitled status.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is contingent upon alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation arises from conscious misalignment with entitled conduct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires maintenance of ritual and social purity",
    "Restoration logic demands reclamation of rightful spiritual station",
    "Consciousness alignment is disrupted through association with degraded states"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual accepts wealth from a socially-condemned source THEN their entitled legal standing is automatically suspended UNTIL purification protocol is completed",
    "IF an individual engages in commercial activity without prescribed caste sanction THEN access to ceremonial rights SHALL be restricted until corrective action is executed",
    "IF an individual serves a śūdra in personal or professional capacity THEN eligibility for Vedic participation IS revoked pending restoration process",
    "IF an individual utters falsehood knowingly THEN recognition as a trustworthy declarant IS nullified UNTIL integrity reintegration is achieved"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, any litigant found to have violated these axioms must undergo immediate suspension of testimonial validity and ceremonial entitlements. The court shall refer such cases to appointed Dharma-enforcement councils for execution of restorative protocols prior to case resumption.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that degradation of entitled status occurs naturally upon violation; no external penalty is required. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) follows the inherent collapse of qualified standing. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the degree of conscious deviation. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that exclusion from entitled functions is not imposed but self-manifested due to causal dissonance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification rites under certified Vedic supervision",
    "Perform public declaration of truth before assembled community",
    "Undertake service to regenerate lost merit within sanctioned bounds",
    "Submit completion affidavit affirming cessation of violating behavior",
    "Reaffirm alignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. This Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
