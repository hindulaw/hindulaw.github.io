  "transliteration": "etadeva caredabdaṃ prāyaścittaṃ dvijottamaḥ |\npramāpya vaiśyaṃ vṛttasthaṃ dadyāccaikaśataṃ gavām || 11.129|| dadyādvaiśataṃ gavām",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The twice-born who has engaged in improper conduct with a Vaishya of upright livelihood shall execute a year-long corrective action and restore balance by offering one hundred cows.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Only the twice-born are subject to this dharma-adhikara due to their initiated consciousness capacity.",
    "Causation: Misaligned engagement creates karmic distortion requiring conscious restitution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Correction aligns with the actor's spiritual and social position.",
    "Restoration logic: Offering symbolizes energetic completion and reintegration into dharmic flow.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Action aims at purifying intent rather than inflicting consequence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = dvija AND misconduct_occurred WITH vaishya_of_upright_livelihood THEN enforce_one_year_corrective_action.",
    "IF corrective_action_complete AND offering_not_made THEN trigger_restorative_completion_protocol.",
    "IF offering_made = true THEN record_dharmic_reset AND update_karmic_ledger.",
    "IF actor.capacity < dvija THEN redirect_to_appropriate_dharma_pathway.",
    "IF misconduct.intent = absent THEN reduce_offering_quantity_proportionally."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that only those initiated into Vedic consciousness bear full dharmic liability. The court must assess both the actor’s spiritual status and the nature of misalignment. Restitution through conscious offering supersedes punitive measures, ensuring alignment with cosmic justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that imbalance arises from unregulated interaction; anupūrvaśaḥ shows its sequential effects. Responsibility is proportional to initiation level. Offering restores equilibrium without invoking suffering, affirming Nyaya as consciousness-led correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate one-year completion cycle with daily reflective practices.",
    "Assign supervision by qualified dvija mentor to oversee restitution process.",
    "Facilitate acquisition and presentation of one hundred cows as conscious offering.",
    "Conduct closing ritual witnessed by community elders to signify reintegration.",
    "Update societal records to reflect restored integrity and reset karmic trace."

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
