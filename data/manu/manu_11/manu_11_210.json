  "transliteration": "yair abhyupāyair enāṁsi mānavo vyapakarṣati |\ntān vo 'bhyupāyān vakṣyāmi devaṛṣipitṛsevitān || 11.210 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "I shall now declare those means by which a human being draws forth the subtle energies of existence; these are the very methods honored by gods, sages, and ancestors.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with cosmic intelligence, not institutional position",
    "Causation originates in conscious engagement with subtle energetic laws",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to invoke and direct existential forces",
    "Restoration logic operates through reverting to original energetic purity",
    "Consciousness alignment enables lawful access to universal mechanisms"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent invokes subtle energies WITHOUT alignment to dharma THEN restoration protocol initiates UNTIL alignment is restored",
    "IF individual accesses ancestral methodologies THEN capacity verification MUST precede authorization",
    "IF action disrupts subtle energy flow THEN automatic reintegration sequence activates WITHOUT punitive intervention",
    "IF method aligns with deva-ṛṣi-pitṛ tradition THEN it is self-authorizing within conscious integrity framework"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving metaphysical causality or energetic interference, the threshold of responsibility lies in the conscious invocation of subtle laws. Authority flows from alignment with primordial wisdom traditions, not procedural formality. Courts must assess not just intent but ontological congruence with foundational energetic principles upheld by divine seers.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that disturbance in subtle realms arises from misaligned invocation, not inherent evil. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation follows precise energetic sequences. Proportional responsibility corresponds to the degree of conscious participation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms all disruptions resolve through realignment, never through infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein disrupted energies return to source pattern",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol requiring full acknowledgment of causal involvement",
    "Deploy capacity restoration mechanism to realign individual with original energetic integrity",
    "Enforce integrity reintegration sequence linking personal consciousness with ancestral wisdom stream"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus speaks Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as Source-Authority: Dharma prevails when humans engage subtle energies through divinely sanctioned means. Justice restores consciousness to its pristine state without recourse to punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through alignment with eternal law."
