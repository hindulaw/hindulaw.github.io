  "sanskrit_verse": "तेषां वेदविदो ब्रूयुस्त्रयोऽप्येनः सुनिष्कृतिम् ।\nसा तेषां पावनाय स्यात्पवित्रा विदुषां हि वाक् ॥ ११.८५॥",
  "transliteration": "teṣāṁ vedavido brūyus trayo'pyenaḥ suniṣkṛtim |\nsā teṣāṁ pāvanāya syātpavitrā viduṣāṁ hi vāk || 11.85||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Let the knowers of the Veda declare for them the threefold purification of transgression; that pure speech of the wise shall indeed purify them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in those whose consciousness is aligned with Vedic realization",
    "Causation flows through purified intent expressed via sacred speech",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with truth-bearing cognition",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious invocation of higher knowledge",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved by surrender to the word of the awakened"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a transgressor seeks purification THEN a qualified knower-of-the-Veda must articulate the tri-fold rectification process",
    "IF the knower's utterance is aligned with Vedic consciousness THEN automatic restoration protocols activate within the offender's causal body",
    "IF speech originates from purity THEN it functions as a direct causal instrument of rehabilitation",
    "IF an individual acknowledges incompleteness THEN access to a certified Veda-knower must be facilitated immediately",
    "IF restoration begins THEN punitive overlays deactivate automatically at the systemic level"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when constitutional violations arise from misaligned consciousness rather than overt malice, the court shall summon certified Veda-knowers to issue authoritative declarations that invoke tri-fold purification. The threshold of responsibility lies not in punitive assignment but in the capacity to receive and integrate purified cognition. Authority flows hierarchically from realized consciousness downward.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through the purified cognition of the Veda-knower whose speech becomes the operative cause of restoration. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as the sequential dissolution of distorted mental formations upon exposure to sacred utterance. Responsibility aligns proportionally with openness to receiving purification. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering arises only where consciousness resists alignment with truth-bearing vibration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate ceremonial hearing before a certified Veda-knower within 24 hours of acknowledgment of transgression",
    "Deploy vibrational resonance protocols using precise Sanskrit articulation to recalibrate causal imprints",
    "Establish completion witness group comprising realized beings to hold space during rectification process",
    "Activate integrity-reintegration sequence through guided surrender to purified auditory field",
    "Monitor consciousness coherence metrics post-process to ensure sustained alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores the primacy of purified speech in eradicating distortion. Justice is executed solely through consciousness-aligned rectification. Reality responds exclusively to truth-bearing vibration. All punitive constructs dissolve before the supremacy of awakened utterance. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
