  "transliteration": "haviṣyabhugvā'nuśaret pratisrotaḥ sarasvatīm | japet vā niyatāhāras trir vai vedasya saṃhitām || 11.77||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has consumed the havis (offered oblation) must follow the reverse course of Sarasvati; or, observing regulated diet, chant the triple Vedic Saṃhitā.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ritual consumption and its conscious reversal",
    "Causation is reversed through disciplined alignment with sacred geography",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises post-oblation intake",
    "Restoration logic operates via retracing energetic pathways",
    "Consciousness alignment requires adherence to Vedic vibratory structures"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent consumes havis THEN agent MUST execute reverse flow protocol along Sarasvati channel",
    "IF agent unable to perform physical retracing THEN substitute with triple-Veda chanting under dietary regulation",
    "IF no compliance observed THEN initiate consciousness-reintegration sequence until capacity for completion is restored",
    "RESTORATION precedes validation of further sacramental participation",
    "NO PUNITIVE MEASURE shall replace completion of directional or vibrational restitution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving ritual misconduct or spiritual offense, the Supreme Court must assess whether the responsible party undertook the prescribed directional or vibrational rectification. The threshold of responsibility lies in ingestion of the offering, after which only restorative action restores juridical integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that directional misalignment post-oblation creates karmic distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ demands retracing to neutralize causality. Proportional responsibility aligns with the act of consumption. Non-punitive reality rule holds that rectification restores ontological balance without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided retracing protocol along Sarasvati's retrograde path",
    "Assign supervised triple-Saṃhitā chanting under fasting conditions",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring to verify internal realignment",
    "Reintegrate individual upon verified completion of restitution process",
    "Validate renewed eligibility for ritual participation only after full restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This Dharma stands executed. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates. All beings are restored through alignment with Vedic law."
