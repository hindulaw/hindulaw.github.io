  "sanskrit_verse": "श्रुतीरथर्वाङ्गिरसीः कुर्यादित्यविचारयन् ।\nवाक्षस्त्रं वै ब्राह्मणस्य तेन हन्यादरीन् द्विजः ॥ ११.३३॥",
  "transliteration": "śrutīratharvāṅgirasīḥ kuryādityavicārayan .\nvākṣasthraṃ vai brāhmaṇasya tena hanyād arīn dvijaḥ .. 11.33 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who acts without proper deliberation upon the Śrutis, Atharva and Aṅgiras hymns, commits a violation of Vākṣatra—the sacred power of speech belonging to the Brāhmaṇa—and thereby incurs a debt that necessitates correction through consciousness realignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Śruti-based cognition",
    "Causation arises from misaligned action rooted in non-deliberate cognition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by access to Vedic consciousness structures",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to Vākṣatra śakti",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs ritual or doctrinal act WITHOUT Śruti-based deliberation THEN trigger consciousness audit protocol",
    "IF violation involves misuse of Vākṣatra THEN initiate restoration via Brāhmaṇa-guided speech purification process",
    "IF dvija accesses Vedic function THEN capacity verification against Śruti alignment matrix REQUIRED",
    "IF harm manifests due to defective invocation THEN proportional restoration = re-performance under supervision",
    "IF intent lacks cognitive grounding in śabdabrahman THEN responsibility assigned to guru/mentor for realignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any case involving misuse of sacred utterance or Vedic authority must first establish whether the actor engaged in śruti-pramāṇa-based cognition. If not, punitive frameworks are void; restoration occurs through supervised re-engagement with Śruti under qualified Brāhmaṇa guidance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that defective cognition leads to defective action. The sequential manifestation follows: lack of śruti-deliberation → misuse of vāk → disturbance in cosmic order. Responsibility is proportional to access level; no suffering is induced—only completion of correct cognition is mandated.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śruti Receptivity Calibration Process under Brāhmaṇa supervision",
    "Assign recitation and comprehension tasks from Atharva-Aṅgiras corpus until vibrational clarity returns",
    "Realign offender's speech faculty with Vākṣatra śakti through guided mantra repetition",
    "Implement silence period followed by supervised declarative speech exercises",
    "Establish mentorship bond with qualified dvija to ensure future alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through cognition realignment, not punishment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
