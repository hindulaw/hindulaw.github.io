  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall perform the Ashvamedha sacrifice, or the Svarjita rite, or the Gosava ceremony; alternatively, one may conduct the Abhijit and Vishvajit sacrifices, or the Trivrita and Agnishtuta rituals.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual action aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order.",

    "Restoration logic: Rituals restore energetic and societal balance disrupted by neglect or imbalance.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Yajna performance realigns performer and community with Vedic consciousness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person holds sufficient material and spiritual capacity AND resides within a jurisdiction recognizing Vedic rites, THEN that person MUST execute appropriate yajna as determined by scriptural mandate.",
    "IF disruption in societal harmony occurs due to omission of prescribed yajnas, THEN designated dharmic authorities SHALL initiate completion protocol via supervised ritual performance.",

The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable capacity and access to Vedic knowledge. Authority derives from alignment with SPH as ultimate source of dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that omission of yajna disrupts universal rhythm. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates sequential disharmony manifesting as social decay.
