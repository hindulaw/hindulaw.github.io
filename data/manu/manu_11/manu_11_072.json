  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्रह्महा द्वादश समाः कुटीं कृत्वा वने वसेत् ।\nभैक्षाश्यात्मविशुद्ध्यर्थं कृत्वा शवशिरो ध्वजम् ॥ ११.७२॥",
  "transliteration": "brahmahā dvādaśa samāḥ kuṭīṁ kṛtvā vane vaset |\nbhaikṣāśyātmaviśuddhyarthaṁ kṛtvā śavaśiro dhvajam || 11.72||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has committed the act of killing a Brāhmaṇa shall reside in a forest for twelve years, constructing a hut and sustaining life through alms, with the head of a corpse affixed as a banner, for the purification of consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious alignment with Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises from volitional distortion of consciousness, not external action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the ability to restore disrupted harmony",
    "Restoration logic demands experiential recognition of violated sanctity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires embodied acknowledgment of transgressed boundaries"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent commits violation categorized as 'Brahmahatya', THEN initiate 12-year Vana-prastha protocol",
    "IF Vana-prastha protocol active, THEN enforce sustenance restriction to alms-based living",
    "IF Vana-prastha protocol active, THEN mandate construction and residence within self-built forest shelter",
    "IF consciousness-restoration phase initiated, THEN deploy symbolic reintegration via ritualized acknowledgment",
    "IF completion verified by Nyaya-adhikarana, THEN dissolve prior identity and recognize purified state"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of Brahmanicide necessitates immediate initiation of consciousness-realigning protocols without punitive incarceration. The authority lies exclusively in facilitating the offender's reintegration through experiential atonement under Dharmic supervision.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the act disrupts universal sanctity; hence, sequential manifestation (Anupūrvaśaḥ) unfolds through sustained exposure to foundational elements. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness lost during commission. Non-punitive reality is upheld as suffering serves no jurisprudential function—only restoration does.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vana-prastha dwelling protocol with mandatory alms-based survival",
    "Construct temporary shelter using natural materials available in designated wilderness zone",
    "Display symbolic emblem (Śavaśiraḥ dhvaja) to invoke constant awareness of violated purity",
    "Enforce daily recitation of Vedic hymns attuned to sanctification of life-energy",
    "Assign periodic review by appointed Dharmic overseer to assess consciousness realignment progress"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This verdict emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through consciousness realigned. There is no punishment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness itself is the ultimate adjudicator."
