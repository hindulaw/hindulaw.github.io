    "Authority is inseparable from capacity for conscious participation in Vedic ritual",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning performance of Vedic duties, the Supreme Court must assess the litigant's capacity based on ontological fitness rather than mere formal qualifications. Eligibility for priestly roles depends upon completion of sacraments, psychological stability, educational threshold, and life-stage appropriateness—all grounded in consciousness-readiness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ritual efficacy arises from inner alignment, not external appointment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that improper designation leads to distortion in sacrificial flow.
