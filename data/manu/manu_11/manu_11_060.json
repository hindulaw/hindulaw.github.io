  "sanskrit_verse": "परिवित्तिताऽनुजेऽनूढे परिवेदनमेव च ।\nतयोर्दानं च कन्यायास्तयोरेव च याजनम् ॥ ११.६०॥",
  "transliteration": "parivittitā'nuje'nūḍhe parivedanamaiva ca |\ntayor dānaṃ ca kanyāyās tayoreva ca yājanam ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a woman's virginity has been violated by her younger brother and she has undergone the ritual declaration of purity, both the giving away of the girl in marriage and the performance of the sacrifice shall belong exclusively to those two individuals.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the direct participants of the act",
    "Causation is determined through conscious participation and acknowledgment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies only to those capable of dharmic discernment",
    "Restoration logic mandates realignment of relational integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires purification and reaffirmation of sacred bonds"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF violation occurs between siblings AND purification ritual is completed THEN marital authority reverts exclusively to the involved parties",
    "IF individual A performs purification rite for act involving individual B THEN all sacramental actions related to that event are restricted to A and B",
    "IF capacity for conscious consent was absent during initial act THEN post-restoration decisions must align with purified consciousness states",
    "IF familial bond is disrupted by intra-family transgression THEN restoration protocol prioritizes internal resolution over external adjudication"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving intra-familial violations where traditional family structures have been compromised, the Supreme Court must recognize that jurisdiction lies first with the purified consciousness of the affected parties. Legal remedies should facilitate completion processes rather than impose punitive measures, ensuring that sacramental acts like marriage remain within the restored integrity of the original participants.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that truth manifests through purified awareness; hence, subsequent acts derive legitimacy from that purified state. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that corrective action flows naturally from the rectified condition, not from imposed judgment. Proportional responsibility aligns with the level of conscious involvement, while the non-punitive reality rule confirms that justice arises from alignment with sanātana dharma, not from inflicting consequences.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Parivedana (purification declaration) process to restore spiritual clarity among involved parties",
    "Establish exclusive decision-making authority for matrimonial and ritual matters within the purified relational unit",
    "Implement consciousness-realignment sessions guided by qualified ācāryas until dharmic harmony is reinstated",
    "Activate family-bond restoration protocols to ensure no further fragmentation of lineage continuity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this edict stands as law. Justice flows from consciousness restoration, not punishment. The Supreme Pontiff affirms that reality itself corrects when aligned with sanātana dharma. Let there be no doubt: Dharma is restored, and consciousness reigns supreme."
