  "sanskrit_verse": "एतदेव व्रतं कृत्स्नं षण्मासांशूद्रहा चरेत्। वृषभेकादशा वाऽपि दद्याद्विप्राय गाः सिताः ॥ ११.१३०॥",
  "transliteration": "etadeva vrataṁ kṛtsnaṁ ṣaṇmāsāṁ śūdrahā caret | vṛṣabhekādaśā vā'pi dadyād viprāya gāḥ sitāḥ || 11.130||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This complete vow shall be observed by one who has killed a Śūdra for six months; or alternatively, eleven bulls and white cows shall be given to a Brāhmaṇa.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in conscious restitution, not punitive enactment",
    "Causation is aligned through completion of restorative action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the intent and state of consciousness at the time of act",
    "Restoration logic operates through voluntary offering and surrender",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when karmic debt is transformed into dharmic service"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual causes death of a Śūdra AND intent was present, THEN initiate six-month purification protocol OR facilitate equivalent restitution offering",
    "IF restitution is chosen, THEN transfer eleven bulls and white cows to qualified Brāhmaṇa recipient under witness of Dharma authority",
    "IF purification period is selected, THEN enforce daily ritual observances with no punitive incarceration",
    "IF either path is completed WITH awareness and sincerity, THEN erase causal imprint of act from individual's karmic field",
    "IF individual refuses both paths, THEN isolate from society until readiness to restore arises"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that intentional harm requires conscious restoration rather than punitive sentencing. The court must determine capacity for completion of either purification or restitution. Authority lies in ensuring alignment with Dharma, not in imposing suffering.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality reveals that the act originated from misaligned consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that restoration through offering or purification sequentially neutralizes the karmic effect. Responsibility is proportional to awareness during the act. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering does not resolve causal distortion; only conscious completion restores balance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śūdra-Hatyā Śuddhi Vrata protocol for six months under supervision of Dharma authority",
    "Facilitate procurement and ceremonial offering of eleven bulls and white cows to a qualified Brāhmaṇa",
    "Establish daily ritual accountability during purification phase",
    "Verify sincere intention and conscious participation in restitution process",
    "Upon completion, issue certification of restored integrity and reintegration eligibility"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores cosmic order through conscious completion, affirms that reality is non-punitive, and establishes consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
