  "transliteration": "avagūrya tvabdaśataṃ sahasramabhihatya ca | jighāṃsayā brāhmaṇasya narakaṃ pratipadyate || 11.206 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, with intent to harm, strikes a Brahmin with a cudgel or staff, or with any weapon, even playfully or in jest, enters a hell reserved for such offenders.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of spiritual rank determines severity of violation",
    "Causation through intent overrides physical consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes awareness of sacred hierarchy",
    "Restoration logic demands purification and consciousness correction",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of inviolable spiritual order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor intends harm AND target is identified as Brahmin THEN violation triggers automatic restoration protocol",
    "IF physical act involves striking instrument AND intent is present THEN classification escalates regardless of outcome",
    "IF social role of victim invokes sacred protection THEN judicial response activates purification enforcement",
    "IF action disrupts cosmic-social harmony THEN realignment process initiates without punitive condition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the recognition of the Brahmin's spiritual station and the perpetrator's conscious intent. The court must ensure that the offender undergoes a completion process that restores both societal and cosmic balance, rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that intent (jighāṃsā) is the root cause, not the physical injury. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that disruption of dharma manifests sequentially through individual and cosmic misalignment. Responsibility is proportional to the violator's capacity to recognize sacred order. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering is not justice, but correction of consciousness is.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tapobhanga Correction Process to purify intent residue",
    "Assign Veda-patha recitation under qualified Guru supervision",
    "Enforce Dana-prayoga restitution to community service aligned with violated principle",
    "Undertake Yajña participation to restore energetic alignment with cosmic order"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness realignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
