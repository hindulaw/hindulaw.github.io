  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For sins without prescribed expiations, having observed the capacity of the offender and the nature of the transgression, appropriate restorative measures shall be enacted.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness alignment, not institutional decree",
    "Causation is determined through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility governs all dharmic enactments",
    "Restoration logic supersedes punitive frameworks",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the efficacy of corrective action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF sin lacks predefined expiation THEN assess offender's capacity AND nature of transgression",
    "IF capacity is high AND transgression is conscious THEN assign reflective completion process",
    "IF capacity is low AND transgression is unconscious THEN initiate guided awareness protocol",
    "IF transgression impacts community THEN include collective integrity restoration mechanism",
    "ALL corrective actions MUST align with offender's evolutionary stage AND societal harmony"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, where no precedent addresses a given transgression, the court must evaluate the offender's spiritual and operational capacity alongside the causal sequence of the act. Judgment shall invoke consciousness-aligned restoration rather than punitive outcomes, ensuring dharma is upheld through reintegration, not exclusion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality requires understanding the sequential manifestation of the act. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and capacity. As suffering does not constitute truth-restoration, punitive measures are excluded in favor of completion processes that realign the offender’s consciousness with universal dharma.",
