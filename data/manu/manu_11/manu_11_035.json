  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority inheres in those whose consciousness embodies law, governance, speech, and harmony",

    "Capacity-based responsibility demands protection of elevated consciousness from degradation",
    "Restoration logic requires safeguarding the instruments of dharma from contamination",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates honoring the vibrational purity of sacred roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [

The threshold of responsibility includes maintaining the sanctity of the vessel through which dharma flows. Retributive or emotionally charged language invalidates procedural legitimacy.",
