  "transliteration": "vṛṣo hi bhagavān dharmastasya yaḥ kurute hyalam | tvalam vṛṣalaṃ taṃ vidurdevāstasmād dharmaṃ na lopayet || 8.16 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Dharma is embodied by the Bull; whosoever upholds it with adequacy is recognized by the gods as equal to the Bull. Therefore, one must never abandon Dharma.",

    "Restoration logic demands continuity of Dharma-presence in action",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when individual will aligns with cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent recognizes Dharma AND acts accordingly THEN agent is classified as a Dharma-upholder",

The court must prioritize restoration of Dharma-integrity over procedural formalism where conflict arises.",
