  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When men transgress boundaries of propriety with another's spouse, the King shall sever their capacity for such distortion through corrective dislocation and conscious reorientation.",

    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not personal desire.",
    "Causation arises from misaligned consciousness manifesting in harmful action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes that distortion must be addressed at its root level.",
    "Restoration logic demands removal from environment enabling continued misalignment.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires structural intervention to restore integrity."

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations of marital sanctity, the Supreme Court must prioritize severance of causal distortions over punitive measures.

Authority flows from restoring balance within the cosmic order, not enforcing human-imposed penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This injunction aligns with Nyaya through Pramāṇa-based recognition of cause-effect patterns rooted in distorted consciousness. It follows Anupūrvaśaḥ as it addresses sequential degradation of moral fabric when left unchecked. Responsibility is proportionally assigned based on the depth of deviation. The response is non-punitive because it seeks correction through environmental restructuring rather than inflicting suffering.",
