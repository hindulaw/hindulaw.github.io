  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When five nights have passed, or a full fortnight, or even one month has elapsed, the King shall personally ensure the establishment of appropriate offerings for the restoration of Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's duty to maintain Dharma through direct observance and ritual rectification.",
    "Causation aligns with time-bound spiritual degradation requiring immediate sovereign intervention.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns temporal rulers as executors of cosmic balance through ceremonial enactment.",
    "Restoration logic mandates visible acts of offering and consecration to realign collective consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved by sovereign action that reaffirms divine order at prescribed intervals."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a non-negotiable threshold of sovereign accountability tied to cyclical time. The court must recognize when executive authority has failed in its Dharmic obligation and issue directives compelling visible restorative actions, not punitive measures. Temporal governance is subordinate to cosmic rhythm, and judicial oversight ensures compliance without moral condemnation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies disruption cycles linked to neglect of sacred rhythms. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential decay if offerings are omitted. Proportional responsibility lies solely with the sovereign, whose duty is completion, not correction. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment invites disorder, which only sovereign offering can resolve.",
