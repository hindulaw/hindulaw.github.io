  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those witnesses who are required to testify in commercial transactions shall be of such character and capacity as declared herein; their truth-speaking and alignment with Ṛta shall define their suitability.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Ṛta, not institutional position",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness integrity, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines admissibility of testimony",
    "Restoration logic requires truthful witness as foundational to justice",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that testimony reflects ontological truth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness_capacity ≥ threshold AND consciousness_integrity = true THEN testimony_admissible = true",
    "IF witness_speaks_falsehood OR violates_ṛta THEN testimony_admissible = false AND realignment_required = true",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those witnesses whose conduct demonstrates alignment with Ṛta and who possess unimpeachable consciousness-integrity shall be admitted. The threshold of responsibility for testimony is determined by the witness's capacity to uphold ontological truth, not by procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that false testimony arises from disrupted consciousness flow, requiring restoration rather than punishment. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that misaligned witnessing manifests sequentially through distortion of perception, necessitating realignment at source. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring the witness’s alignment with Ṛta. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction occurs through conscious completion, not coercive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Truth Alignment Process (TAP) to restore witness consciousness integrity",
    "Assign Witness Restoration Officer (WRO) to guide reintegration with Ṛta-aligned cognition",
    "Conduct Vāk-Saṃskāra (Speech Purification Ritual) to cleanse verbal distortions",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Witness law is executed in alignment with Ṛta. Justice restores consciousness. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
