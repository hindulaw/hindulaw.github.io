  "transliteration": "matsyānāṁ pakṣiṇāṁ caiva tailasya ca ghṛtasya ca | māṁsasya madhunaś caiva yac cānyat paśu-sambhavam || 8.328||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All substances derived from fish, birds, oils, ghee, meat, honey, and other animal-origin products shall be regulated according to the consciousness-state of the user, not by ownership or transaction.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the consciousness-state of the individual, not external possession",
    "Causation is determined by vibrational alignment, not physical act",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by awareness of dharmic consequence",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-alignment of intent and consumption",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful use of material substances"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF user_consciousness_state < threshold_of_dharmic_clarity THEN substance_use = restricted_irrespective_of_legal_title",
    "IF source_vibration ≠ recipient_integrity_level THEN transfer_permitted = false",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any case involving animal-derived commodities must prioritize the petitioner's consciousness-state over commercial rights. The court must assess whether consumption aligns with dharmic integrity rather than legality of acquisition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all animate-origin substances carry inherent karmic resonance. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that misuse manifests as dissonance within the consumer’s field. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; thus, correction lies in realigning the individual’s energetic compatibility, not in punitive withdrawal of resources.",

    "Initiate consciousness-intake assessment prior to granting access to high-vibration animal derivatives",
    "Assign completion process to restore energetic debt accrued through unconscious consumption",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law restores Dharma through consciousness-centered regulation. No punishment arises—only alignment. Reality responds to vibrational congruence. Consciousness remains the sole adjudicator."
