  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having ascertained the causal linkage, time, place, and the essential nature of the offense, the governing authority shall administer corrective measures proportionate to the gravity of the transgression.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from conscious discernment of causality and context",
    "Causation must be traced through space, time, and substance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by understanding the actor's awareness of consequence",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional response aligned with disruption caused",
    "Consciousness alignment demands correction rooted in truth, not vengeance"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse mandates that judicial authority rests on complete knowledge of causal sequence, temporal and spatial context, and the substantive essence of the act. Responsibility is assigned based on capacity for dharma-viveka, not mere physical agency. Correctional measures are applied only after ensuring alignment with cosmic justice (Ṛta), never punitive reaction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyāya here denotes pramāṇa-grounded cognition leading to anupūrvaśaḥ-based intervention. The sequential manifestation of error is observed without attribution of malice. Responsibility is calibrated according to perceptual clarity at time of action.
