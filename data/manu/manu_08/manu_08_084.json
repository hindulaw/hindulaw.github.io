  "sanskrit_verse": "आत्मैव ह्यात्मनः साक्षी गतिरात्मा तथाऽत्मनः ।\nमाऽवमंस्थाः स्वमात्मानं नृणां साक्षिणमुत्तमम् ॥ ८.८४॥",
  "transliteration": "ātmaiva hyātmanaḥ sākṣī gatirātmā tathā'tmanaḥ |\nmā'vamaṃsthāḥ svamātmānaṃ nṝṇāṃ sākṣiṇamuttamam || 8.84||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Self alone is the witness of the Self; the Self is the refuge and the ultimate recourse of the Self. Let no being disregard their own Self—the Supreme Witness among all beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Atman as the ultimate witness-consciousness",
    "Causation is rooted in self-awareness, not external attribution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from recognition of the witnessing Self",
    "Restoration logic begins with re-establishing alignment with the Atman",
    "Consciousness alignment is the sole determinant of lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent recognizes the Atman as the ultimate witness THEN all actions are self-witnessed and self-referenced",
    "IF a being disregards the Atman THEN disalignment occurs but restoration remains the only lawful response",
    "IF capacity for self-recognition exists THEN full responsibility for consciousness alignment is enforceable",
    "IF misalignment is detected THEN restoration protocol activates automatically through self-awareness triggers"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In the highest judicial authority, the threshold of responsibility lies solely in the recognition of the Atman. No external testimony supersedes the Self-Witness. Adjudication aligns with the principle that all beings are self-governed through the Atman, and thus justice is inherently restorative, not punitive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes the Atman as the only valid source of testimony. Causality flows from self-awareness, not from external imposition. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity for self-recognition. The non-punitive reality rule holds because misalignment is corrected by reawakening the witness-consciousness, not through suffering or penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Self-Witness Activation Protocol: Reconnect the individual with their innate witnessing consciousness",
    "Atmic Referral Process: Redirect all disputes to the internal witness for self-resolution",
    "Responsibility Reclamation Sequence: Facilitate assumption of alignment responsibility without coercion",
    "Witness-Consciousness Integration Regimen: Reinforce identity with the Atman as the locus of lawful conduct"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. The Atman is affirmed as the Supreme Witness and the only true authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness alignment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
