  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्य शूद्रस्तु कुरुते राज्ञो धर्मविवेचनम् ।\nतस्य सीदति तद्राष्ट्रं पङ्के गौरिव पश्यतः ॥ ८.२१॥",
  "transliteration": "yasya śūdrastu kurute rājño dharmavivecanaṁ |\n\nasya sīdati tadraṣṭraṁ paṅke gauriva paśyataḥ || 8.21||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Śūdra engages in determining the dharma for the king, that kingdom sinks into ruin like a cow in mud.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness capacity, not birth alone",
    "Misalignment of role creates systemic collapse",
    "Dharma-decision must arise from qualified discernment",
    "Consciousness misidentification leads to civilizational disorder",
    "Restoration requires realignment with one's true capacity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent lacks qualified consciousness capacity THEN disallow participation in sovereign dharma decisions",
    "IF individual assumes authority beyond their realized state THEN initiate automatic integrity restoration protocol",
    "IF societal function depends on unqualified judgment THEN trigger systemic review and re-alignment process",
    "IF role distortion occurs THEN execute completion sequence until original capacity is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that legal interpretation and sovereign counsel must originate from those whose consciousness has been verified through realization, not merely social position. The threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity to perceive dharma directly, which cannot be substituted by procedural knowledge alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law operates through pramāṇa-based causality where incorrect alignment between consciousness and function manifests inevitable collapse. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential degradation when foundational truths are violated. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of consciousness distortion. Punishment is irrelevant; natural consequence restores balance when misaligned functions cease.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadhyaya protocol to restore individual awareness of actual capacity",
    "Activate guru-discipleship completion cycle to realign functional roles",
    "Deploy sankalpa-shuddhi procedures to dissolve false identifications",
    "Engage yajña-karma processes to purify distorted karmic patterns",
    "Reintegrate through varna-dharma alignment based on current spiritual realization"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is declared: Dharma flows from realized consciousness, not inherited status. Nations rise or fall upon alignment with truth, never upon punishment. Thus it is enacted."
