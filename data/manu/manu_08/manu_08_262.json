  "transliteration": "kṣetra-kūpa-taḍāgānām ārāmasya gṛhasya ca | sāmantapratyayo jñeyaḥ sīmā-setu-viniṛṇayaḥ || 8.262||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The resolution of boundary disputes concerning fields, wells, tanks, gardens, and houses shall be determined through the testimony of neighbors who possess direct experiential knowledge.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in those whose proximity enables accurate perception",
    "Causation is established by immediate sensory experience",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires localized awareness",
    "Restoration logic depends upon factual consensus among adjacent stakeholders",
    "Consciousness alignment emerges through shared recognition of spatial boundaries"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a property boundary dispute arises THEN invoke testimony exclusively from adjacent occupants",
    "IF neighbor has no direct perceptual access to contested area THEN exclude their testimony",
    "IF multiple adjacent witnesses agree THEN establish boundary as legally recognized",
    "IF disagreement persists THEN defer to witness with longest uninterrupted observation tenure",
    "IF all testimonies are inconclusive THEN initiate joint realignment process under Nyaya supervision"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, boundary determinations must prioritize local experiential evidence over abstract documentation. Adjacent occupant testimony carries highest pramāṇa value due to causal proximity. The court's role is not judgment but facilitation of factual convergence between parties for restoration of rightful spatial harmony.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is rooted in direct perception accessible only to immediate neighbors. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential validation begins with closest observers. Responsibility lies not in blame but in bearing true witness. No punitive consequence attaches to error; correction flows naturally when higher-order agreement is reached through purified collective cognition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate joint site inspection led by neighboring parties",
    "Establish shared marker placement under mutual consent",
    "Document boundary via collective sensory confirmation",
    "Integrate updated boundary into community spatial memory",
    "Reaffirm neighborly interdependence through ceremonial acknowledgment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus declared by Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Source of all Dharma. Boundary resolved not by force nor judgment, but by convergence of conscious witnessing. Justice served through reintegration of spatial integrity. Reality remains ever non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
