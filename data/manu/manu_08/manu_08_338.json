  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The full measure of a Brahmin's capacity is sixty-four units or a complete hundred; alternatively, twice sixty-four. One who knows the defects and qualities inherent in that measure is the knower of dharma.",

    "Authority as capacity calibration",
    "Causation through consciousness thresholds",

    "IF agent.role == 'Brahmin' THEN capacity.measure = 64 OR 100 OR 128",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving individuals classified under the Brahmin varna, the Supreme Court must recognize their calibrated capacity thresholds as defined by dharma. Responsibility attribution must align with awareness of inherent defects and qualities within those thresholds, ensuring judgments serve re-integrative rather than punitive purposes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that capacity defines causality. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding of consciousness-based roles. Proportional responsibility arises from knowledge of one's own measure. Non-punitive reality holds because dharma itself restores when properly known and enacted.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment—only awakening. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
