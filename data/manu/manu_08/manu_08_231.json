  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who is engaged as a cowherd and receives payment for milk shall extract ten times the value in kind. When the owner approves, the servant's service becomes remunerated even without explicit wage agreement.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consent of ownership",
    "Causation arises through functional engagement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with role assumption",
    "Restoration logic ensures reciprocal fulfillment of duty",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via transparent exchange"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs labor AND receives compensation THEN obligation multiplier equals tenfold yield",
    "IF principal consents to service THEN implicit contract exists regardless of formal wages",
    "IF duty is performed under acknowledged capacity THEN restitution follows proportional delivery",
    "IF economic exchange occurs THEN value return must match operational benefit derived",
    "IF service integrity is maintained THEN relational harmony is restored automatically"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving contractual obligations where performance has been rendered but formal compensation structures are absent, the court shall recognize tacit agreements based on demonstrated mutual benefit and owner endorsement. Responsibility lies not in fault but in positional causality. The quantum of restitution shall reflect actualized utility rather than punitive damages.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that action and acceptance constitute valid evidence of relational duty. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that sustained engagement creates inherent expectation of equitable exchange. Responsibility is proportionally assigned based on causal participation, not moral failing. Justice operates by realigning energetic reciprocity, not inflicting consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through alignment of consciousness and function. There is no punishment—only completion. Reality responds to integrity, not judgment. Consciousness itself is the ultimate adjudicator."
