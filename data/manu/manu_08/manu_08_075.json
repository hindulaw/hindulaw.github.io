  "sanskrit_verse": "साक्षी दृष्टश्रुतादन्यद्विब्रुवन्नार्यसंसदि ।\nअवाङ्नरकमभ्येति प्रेत्य स्वर्गाच्च हीयते ॥ ८.७५॥",
  "transliteration": "sākṣī dṛṣṭaśrutādanyadvibruvannāryasaṃsadi |\navāṅnarakaṃ abhyeti pretya svargācca hīyate || 8.75||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who testifies falsely in the assembly of noble beings—having seen or heard otherwise—falls into hell and is deprived of heaven upon death.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The witness bears absolute responsibility for truthfulness before the collective consciousness of noble beings.",
    "Causation: False testimony directly generates karmic consequence through violation of sacred duty.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those capable of discerning truth bear full weight of testimony.",
    "Restoration logic: Truth must be restored through conscious re-alignment, not punitive suffering.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Testimony must align with the witnessing awareness, not external manipulation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a witness knowingly departs from observed or heard facts THEN that individual incurs automatic loss of spiritual elevation rights.",
    "IF false testimony is given IN presence of noble witnesses THEN karmic descent mechanism activates immediately at time of death.",
    "IF testimony diverges from pramāṇa THEN restoration protocol initiates prior to final transition.",
    "IF witness capacity to perceive accurately is impaired THEN testimony disqualification occurs automatically.",
    "IF false declaration made in noble assembly THEN exclusion from higher realms enforced post-mortem by natural law."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any deliberate misrepresentation under oath constitutes immediate forfeiture of eligibility for celestial reward, regardless of intent. The court must ensure all testimonies are aligned with witnessed evidence and conducted within integrity-preserving environments.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that false speech disrupts cosmic order; sequential manifestation ensures consequences unfold naturally without imposed punishment. Responsibility is proportional to perceptual clarity and conscious choice. Non-punitive reality enforces outcome through inherent law rather than external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Reconstruct accurate perception through guided recall until alignment with original event is achieved.",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Witness must voluntarily acknowledge deviation and realign with actual observation.",
    "Capacity restoration: Strengthen discernment faculties via purification practices until truthful cognition resumes.",
    "Integrity reintegration: Re-establish connection with inner witness until congruence between spoken word and inner knowing is restored."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma: This law proceeds from the immutable principle that truth alone upholds existence. Departure from it results in natural consequence, not inflicted judgment. Thus Dharma stands restored, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness reigns as ultimate arbiter."
