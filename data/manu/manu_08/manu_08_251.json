  "transliteration": "yāni caivamprakārāṇi kālād bhūmir na bhakṣayet | tāni sandhiṣu sīmāyām aprakāśāni kārayet || 8.251||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those territories which Time itself does not consume—such lands must remain unilluminated and undisclosed at boundary points.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the immutable nature of Time and Space",
    "Causation is rooted in the sequential unfolding of Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with stewardship over spatial integrity",
    "Restoration logic demands preservation of undisturbed boundaries",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of unseen yet potent territorial truths"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF territory is untouched by temporal degradation THEN it SHALL NOT be disclosed or illuminated in boundary treaties",
    "IF land remains unaffected by natural cycles THEN its visibility in geopolitical agreements IS NULL",
    "IF spatial entity maintains ontological neutrality THEN administrative exposure IS PROHIBITED",
    "IF region preserves foundational stillness THEN judicial or public disclosure IS VOID"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating territorial disputes involving ancient or dormant zones, the Supreme Court must recognize that certain lands untouched by time retain a sovereign silence. Disclosure or illumination of these areas in legal instruments contravenes their inherent Dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing what must remain unspoken and unseen.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that untouched lands carry intrinsic stillness; thus, any act of illuminating them disrupts dharma-anupūrvaśaḥ.

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling upholds the sanctity of timeless territories. Dharma is restored. There is no punishment—only realignment of consciousness with the silent sovereignty of space. Reality abides beyond retribution."
