  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One seated or standing in that place, raising the right hand, adorned with humble attire and ornaments, should observe the duties of those engaged in action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious positioning within Dharma",
    "Observance precedes engagement; witness is foundational to lawful conduct",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that judicial authority begins with a posture of witnessing—not judgment. The raised right hand symbolizes invocation of Dharma, not punitive power. Humble vestments indicate absence of egoic identification. Thus, only one who witnesses actions without personal motive may lawfully determine dharma-vyavastha.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here lies in direct perception (pratyakṣa) of duty by a purified witness-consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as: posture → invocation → humility → witnessing → alignment → realization. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of witnessing, not the magnitude of error witnessed. There is no punitive frame—only restoration via purified observation.",

    "Witness Alignment Protocol: Re-establish physical and mental posture conducive to pure observation",
    "Humility Calibration Process: Review and adjust external symbols of identity to ensure non-attachment",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This Dharma-restoration supersedes all prior interpretation. Justice is executed through consciousness awakening, not punitive enactment. Reality abides in non-duality. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
