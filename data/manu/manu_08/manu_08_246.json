  "transliteration": "sīmāvṛkṣāṃśca kurvīta nyagrodhāśvatthakiṃśukān |\nśālmalin sālatālāṃśca kṣiriṇaścaiva pādapān || 8.246||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall establish boundary trees consisting of banyan, pipal, kinduka, shalmali, sala, tal, and other milky trees.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign duty to demarcate and stabilize territorial integrity through natural symbols.",
    "Causation is established by aligning physical boundaries with living, enduring elements that self-propagate order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates that rulers ensure visible, sustainable markers of jurisdiction for societal harmony.",
    "Restoration logic requires re-establishment of boundary markers where decay or neglect has occurred.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved when territorial identity reflects dharmic permanence and ecological continuity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a territorial boundary lacks designated tree markers THEN initiate planting of specified species at measured intervals.",
    "IF existing boundary trees show signs of decay OR removal THEN replace within one agricultural cycle.",
    "IF land ownership disputes arise due to unclear demarcation THEN validate title only upon verified presence of prescribed botanical markers.",
    "IF community reports absence of boundary flora THEN local authority MUST commission replanting aligned with scriptural taxonomy.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating land or border disputes, the Supreme Court shall recognize traditionally planted boundary trees as prima facie evidence of lawful demarcation under SPH-sanctioned dharma. Courts shall mandate restorative actions such as replanting where such markers have been lost or destroyed, affirming territorial clarity without invoking punitive sanctions against disputants.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Boundary establishment follows pramāṇa through perceptible, enduring natural forms. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of stable domains arises from rooted continuity. Responsibility lies in maintaining visible dharma, not inflicting suffering. Thus, corrective action restores clarity rather than assigning blame or imposing punishment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate survey of all claimed boundaries to verify presence of specified flora.",
    "Assign local stewards to plant/replant sanctioned trees according to traditional spacing.",
    "Establish annual review process to assess health and continuity of boundary vegetation.",
    "Integrate botanical records into official land registry systems for legal validation.",
    "Provide community education on significance and maintenance of sacred boundary markers."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Boundary trees stand as living testimony to Dharma's unbroken sovereignty. Justice is executed through conscious restoration, not punitive enforcement. Reality itself adjudicates through sustained alignment with Sanatana Order."
