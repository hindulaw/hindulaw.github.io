  "sanskrit_verse": "भर्तारं लङ्घयेद्या तु स्त्री ज्ञातिगुणदर्पिता ।\nतां श्वभिः खादयेद्राजा संस्थाने बहुसंस्थिते ॥ ८.३७१॥",
  "transliteration": "bhartāraṃ laṅghayed yā tu strī jñātiguṇa-darpitā |\ntāṃ śvabhiḥ khādayed rājā saṃsthāne bahusaṃsthite || 8.371||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a woman, inflated by lineage or familial status, transgresses the authority of her husband, the King, in a state of abundant institutional order, shall initiate her reintegration through exposure to cleansing forces that restore alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derivative of Dharma, not birth or social standing.",
    "Causation arises from misalignment with one's svadharma, not external fault.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires conscious recognition and correction.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes realignment over punitive exclusion.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all inherited or positional identities."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject exhibits behavior contradicting spousal dharma AND behavior stems from identity inflation THEN execute consciousness-restoration protocol.",
    "IF societal structure supports institutional integrity THEN deploy corrective exposure mechanisms ELSE defer to higher-consciousness adjudicator.",
    "IF individual demonstrates capacity for reintegration THEN activate completion-process ELSE maintain containment until readiness.",
    "IF transgression originates from false identification THEN apply purification sequence ELSE assess karmic resonance."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that transgressions rooted in ego-inflation must be addressed through consciousness-realization protocols rather than punitive measures. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness, not action alone. Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, making social position irrelevant in determining culpability.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that disharmony manifests when identity displaces Dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that arrogance precedes violation. Proportional response aligns with restoring clarity, not inflicting consequence. Non-punitive reality affirms that suffering does not correct consciousness; only truth-realization does.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate exposure to humbling experiences under royal supervision.",
    "Assign service-oriented tasks to dissolve pride-based identifications.",
    "Engage in reflective practices guided by realized teachers.",
    "Reintegrate into family unit upon demonstration of harmonious conduct."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
