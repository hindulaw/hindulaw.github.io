  "transliteration": "dvijo'dhvagaḥ kṣīṇavṛttir dvāv ikṣū dve ca mūlake |\nādadānaḥ parakṣetrāt na daṇḍaṃ dātum arhati || 8.341||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born who is a traveler, impoverished in livelihood, and takes two sugarcane stalks or two roots from another's field shall incur no penalty.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is contextually modulated by existential capacity",
    "Causation aligns with necessity-rooted action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility exempts survival-driven acts",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes sustenance over ownership",
    "Consciousness alignment recognizes distinction between need and greed"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor_is_twice_born AND status_is_traveler AND livelihood_is_depleted AND resource_taken <= minimum_sustenance THEN penalty = null",
    "IF intent_is_survival AND property_value_is_non_excessive AND source_is_natural THEN liability_status = exempt",
    "IF action_causes_no_displacement AND community_impact = neutral THEN restitution_obligation = void"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that threshold responsibility is contingent upon the actor’s existential condition. When capacity is diminished and action arises from necessity rather than assertion, punitive measures are inadmissible. The court must assess not only the act but the ontological state of the actor at the time of the act.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that the act stems from immediate necessity, not volitional harm. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that depletion preceded the act, indicating sequential inevitability. Proportional responsibility is absent when the action restores existential balance. The non-punitive reality rule applies as no displacement of dharma occurred.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Ensure the individual receives sustainable support to prevent recurrence",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Community acknowledges its role in enabling conditions of scarcity",
    "Capacity restoration: Provision of temporary aid to restore self-sufficiency",
    "Integrity reintegration: Public recognition of the individual’s adherence to dharmic conduct under duress"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of necessity-bound action. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
