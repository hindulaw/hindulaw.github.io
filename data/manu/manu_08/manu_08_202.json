  "sanskrit_verse": "अथ मूलमनाहार्यं प्रकाशक्रयशोधितः ।\nअदण्ड्यो मुच्यते राज्ञा नाष्टिको लभते धनम् ॥ ८.२०२॥",
  "transliteration": "atha mūlam anāhāryaṁ prakāśa-kraya-śodhitaḥ | adaṇḍyo mucyate rājñā nāṣṭiko labhate dhanam || 8.202 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the root cause is non-apprehensible due to illumination refined through investigative discernment, the undisciplined one is released by the King; the atheist does not gain wealth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness refinement, not coercive power.",
    "Causation must be traced through purified perception, not external evidence alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises only when awareness is unobscured.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes dissolution of ignorance over punitive correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of legal action."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF perception is clarified AND root causation remains unlocatable THEN release the accused.",
    "IF accused demonstrates no capacity for misconduct due to lack of awareness THEN no claim shall accrue.",
    "IF adjudication reveals absence of volitional fault THEN confiscation is void.",
    "IF intent cannot be established through conscious clarity THEN restitution is unlawful."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, where investigative clarity has dissolved causal attribution, release is mandated. Authority lies in ontological transparency, not procedural formality. The court must align with the King's consciousness-pure discernment, ensuring that neither punishment nor reward is issued without verifiable volition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramāṇa—when cognition is cleansed via śodhana, false imputation ceases. As causality becomes indistinct under investigative light, punitive response dissolves. Responsibility flows from clarity; without it, dharma itself withdraws enforcement. Non-punitivity is thus not leniency but precision—aligned consequence responding solely to awakened agency.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process through reflective inquiry until causal misalignment resolves.",
    "Deploy consciousness-refinement techniques to restore perceptual clarity in adjudicators.",
    "Assume responsibility only upon verified volition; otherwise invoke protective withdrawal.",
    "Reintegrate integrity by dissolving false identifications rather than imposing corrective burdens."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through clarity, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
