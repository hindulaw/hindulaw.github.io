  "transliteration": "yadi saśaya eva syātliṅgānāmapi darśane |\nsākṣipratyaya eva syātsīmāvādavinirṇayaḥ || 8.253||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When doubt persists even upon examination of all signs and evidences, resolution in boundary disputes arises solely through the unshakeable witness-principle within the disputants.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the witnessing consciousness, not external proof",
    "Causation is rooted in the clarity of inner observation, not circumstantial inference",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in the ability to dissolve conflict through self-realization",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with the immutable witness-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes evidentiary ambiguity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF boundary dispute EXISTS AND evidence induces DOUBT THEN invoke witness-consciousness validation",
    "IF internal witness-certainty IS present THEN override empirical uncertainty",
    "IF both parties affirm witness-awareness THEN resolve boundary by mutual recognition",
    "IF no objective clarity THEN restoration occurs via shared consciousness alignment",
    "IF conflict remains unresolved THEN assign completion process until witness-certainty manifests"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when material evidence fails to resolve land demarcation disputes, the threshold of responsibility shifts to the capacity of the litigants to recognize the witness-consciousness as the ultimate validator. The court shall facilitate conditions for such awakening rather than prolong procedural contention.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality acknowledges that external proofs may remain inconclusive; thus, sequential manifestation of truth proceeds through inner witness-certainty.
