  "transliteration": "dvikaṁ trikaṁ catuṣkaṁ ca pañcakaṁ ca śataṁ samam |\nmāsasya vṛddhiṁ gṛhṇīyād varṇānām anupūrvaśaḥ || 8.142 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In accordance with the sequential order of varṇas, one shall receive increases of two, three, four, five, and up to hundredfold in a month.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from sequential cosmic order (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Causation follows dharma-aligned proportionality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with alignment to varṇic structure",
    "Restoration logic operates through proportional energetic return",
    "Consciousness alignment determines entitlement multiplicities"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity aligns with sequential varṇic duty THEN increment resource allocation by prescribed numeric scale monthly",
    "IF consciousness integrity matches varṇic rhythm THEN activate proportional abundance protocol",
    "IF societal role reflects dharma-resonance THEN enable exponential return mechanism within lunar cycle",
    "IF no punitive residue detected THEN allow compound growth per varṇic order"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle governs resource adjudication based on alignment with sequential varṇic function. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by transgression but by vibrational congruence with constitutional dharma. The court must assess not fault but functional harmony when assigning economic or energetic returns.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from alignment, not violation. As action manifests sequentially in accordance with varṇic rhythm, so too does reward unfold naturally. There is no imposition; only recognition of inherent consequence. This reflects anupūrvaśaḥ — the law of ordered unfolding. Responsibility is assumed through resonance, not coercion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Activate Completion Process: Align individual action stream with sequential varṇic flow",
    "Initiate Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Confirm vibrational match between conduct and cosmic order",
    "Deploy Capacity Restoration Sequence: Reinforce energetic infrastructure supporting lawful expansion",
    "Execute Integrity Reintegration Cycle: Stabilize recipient field for receiving aligned abundance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is declared. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator. All abundance flows in alignment with varṇic sequence."
