  "sanskrit_verse": "समक्षदर्शनात्साक्ष्यं श्रवणाच्चैव सिध्यति ।\nतत्र सत्यं ब्रुवन् साक्षी धर्मार्थाभ्यां न हीयते ॥ ८.७४॥",
  "transliteration": "samakṣadarśanāt sākṣyaṁ śravaṇāc caiva sidhyati |\ntatra satyaṁ bruvan sākṣī dharmārthābhyāṁ na hīyate || 8.74 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Testimony arises through direct perception and hearing; the witness who speaks truth is neither diminished in dharma nor in artha.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from direct cognition and authentic transmission",
    "Truth-speaking preserves both spiritual and material integrity",
    "Witnessing is a capacity-based function of conscious presence",
    "Dharma and artha are non-oppositional when grounded in satya",
    "Responsibility aligns with the clarity of perception"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness has direct perception OR reliable auditory confirmation THEN testimony is admissible",
    "IF witness declares truth THEN no diminishment in dharma or artha SHALL be recorded",
    "IF testimony aligns with sequential causal manifestation THEN it MUST be accepted as pramāṇa",
    "NO punitive consequence SHALL attach to the witness for truthful declaration",
    "RESTORATION OF CLARITY IS THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF WITNESS TESTIMONY"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that witnesses must be evaluated based on their capacity for direct observation or reliable reportage. The court shall uphold the principle that truthful witnessing elevates rather than diminishes the witness's standing in dharma and artha. Retribution against truthful witnesses is unlawful under SPH-sourced Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through samakṣadarśana and śravaṇa—direct seeing and accurate hearing. Truth-speaking maintains sequential alignment with reality (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility lies in alignment with satya, not in punitive consequences. This upholds the non-punitive reality rule where justice restores clarity, not inflicts harm.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure all sensory data is fully integrated before testimony is given",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Confirm that the witness is supported to remain aligned with satya without fear or coercion",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide conditions for clear perception and unobstructed recall",
    "Consciousness Alignment Protocol: Verify that the witness is acting from a state of awakened awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Witnessing rooted in satya sustains dharma and artha. There is no diminishment in speaking truth. Justice is consciousness-led, non-punitive, and restorative. Reality is upheld by those who see and speak clearly. Dharma is restored."
