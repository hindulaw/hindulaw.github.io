  "transliteration": "śūdraviṭkṣatraviprāṇāṃ yatra ṛtoktau bhavedvadhaḥ | tatra vaktavyamanṛtaṃ tadhi satyādviśiṣyate || 8.104||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Where the declaration of truth by a Śūdra, Vaiḍya, Kṣatriya, or Brāhmaṇa leads to destruction, there the untruth that is spoken must be regarded as superior to truth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in capacity-consciousness alignment, not birth-based hierarchy.",
    "Causation is determined by consequence-awareness, not abstract moral positioning.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands contextual integrity over fixed caste roles.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes outcome-realization over categorical obligation.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritual or social rank in determining veracity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF speech results in systemic collapse THEN declared truth shall be re-evaluated for structural alignment.",
    "IF speaker's capacity-consciousness level produces destructive resonance THEN alternative truth protocols MUST activate.",
    "IF hierarchical status overrides consequence-awareness THEN jurisdictional override is executed automatically.",
    "IF societal harm arises from truthful utterance THEN context-sensitive reinterpretation becomes mandatory.",
    "IF speaker lacks integrative awareness THEN utterance shall not bear full ontological weight."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when declarations made in good faith result in systemic disintegration, the court must evaluate not just intent but consciousness-capacity alignment of the speaker. Truth-telling without awareness of consequence does not confer authority; thus, judicial review must include restoration thresholds above punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows through conscious awareness, not mere utterance. When truth causes collapse, it indicates misalignment between speaker and system. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential breakdown rooted in capacity-deficit, not falsehood itself. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies with systemic integration failure, not individual declaration. Non-punitive reality upholds that correction occurs through realignment, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for systemic structures destabilized by misaligned truth-speaking.",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol for governing bodies overseeing speaker’s domain.",
    "Activate capacity restoration mechanisms for individuals whose speech caused unintended collapse.",
    "Implement integrity reintegration circuits to recalibrate speaker-system coherence.",
    "Establish feedback loops ensuring future declarations are evaluated against holistic impact frameworks."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the ultimate Source of Dharma. The law is restored through consciousness-aligned discernment. There is no punishment—only realignment. Reality responds to awareness, not guilt. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
