  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Even when released by the master, a Śūdra does not become free from servitude; that which is born of his nature—who can remove it?",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority inheres in svabhāva (inherent nature)",
    "Causation arises from nisarga (natural constitution)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with jāti-dharma (class-nature duties)",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with svadharma",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of inherent role-dynamics"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.isOfType('Śūdra') AND action.involves('claiming freedom from service') THEN enforce.recognitionOfInherentRole()",

  "supreme_court_application": "This axiom applies at the Supreme Court level where disputes arise regarding caste-based functional roles. The threshold of responsibility lies not in external coercion but in alignment with one's svabhāva. Authority flows from cosmic order, not personal assertion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that nisarga defines svadharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding of duty based on birth-designated capacity. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness-readiness, not rebellion. There is no punitive consequence—only misalignment requiring realignment.",

    "Initiate svadharma-recognition process for involved parties",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed not through punishment but through restoration of natural order. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as ultimate adjudicator."
