  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, knowing the truth of dharma in matters of wealth, still speaks otherwise—such a person does not fall from the world of svarga, for they speak that celestial speech.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the speaker retains svarga due to invocation of celestial speech. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that declarative alignment precedes karmic consequence. Responsibility is proportional to sustained misalignment, not momentary divergence.
