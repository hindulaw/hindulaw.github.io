  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who defiles a woman under the influence of lust shall not incur the severing of a finger; rather, he shall pay two hundred units of compensation—for the purpose of ceasing the occurrence of such misconduct.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious intent, not physical action",
    "Causation is determined by inner motive, not external consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with dharma, not fear of punishment",
    "Restoration logic operates through proportional completion, not punitive equivalence",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes societal shame or moral condemnation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent acts under lust-driven impulse AND causes defilement THEN assign two hundred-unit compensation AND initiate consciousness restoration protocol",
    "IF intent is primary driver THEN physical penalty SHALL NOT apply ELSE assess causal alignment",
    "IF misconduct recurs THEN escalate integrity reintegration process ELSE maintain current restorative level",
    "COMPENSATION SHALL BE PROPORTIONAL TO PREVENTION OF FUTURE OCCURRENCE, NOT RETRIBUTIVE JUSTICE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the threshold of responsibility lies in the internal state of the actor rather than the external outcome. Authority flows from alignment with dharma-consciousness, making punitive measures obsolete when misalignment stems from untrained desire. The court must enforce completion processes that realign capacity with dharma, using financial restitution solely as a mechanism for preventing recurrence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law demonstrates pramāṇa-based causality where truth is known through direct perception of motive. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation—as desire leads to action. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at time of act. The non-punitive reality rule ensures no bodily harm occurs, affirming that suffering cannot be used as deterrent or correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process requiring offender to undergo conscious desire regulation training",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol involving community service aligned with purity restoration",
    "Implement capacity restoration program focusing on emotional and spiritual maturity development",
    "Enforce integrity reintegration via supervised mentorship until behavioral harmony is restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed not through punishment but through consciousness restoration. Reality affirmed as non-punitive, governed by the supremacy of awakened awareness."
