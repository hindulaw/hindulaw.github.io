  "sanskrit_verse": "यथा नयत्यसृक्पातैर्मृगस्य मृगयुः पदम् ।\nनयेत्तथाऽनुमानेन धर्मस्य नृपतिः पदम् ॥ ८.४४॥",
  "transliteration": "yathā nayatyasṛkpātairmṛgasya mṛgayuḥ padam | nayettathā'numānena dharmasya nṛpatiḥ padam || 8.44||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Just as a hunter tracks the path of a wounded deer by following its blood trail, so too must a ruler trace the path of Dharma through inference and evidence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is rooted in the capacity to discern Dharma through pramāṇa (valid means of knowledge)",
    "Causation is established through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) and evidentiary inference",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rulers to act with perceptual precision, not speculation",
    "Restoration logic demands tracing root causes through observable effects",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates that governance aligns with Dharma's inherent order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF evidence traces to a violation of Dharma THEN ruler MUST follow causal chain through valid inference",
    "IF ruler lacks direct perception THEN inference MUST be grounded in observable consequence",
    "IF Dharma deviation detected THEN restoration protocol activates automatically at source level",
    "IF causal sequence aligns with dharmic breakdown THEN responsibility is assigned based on proximity to origin",
    "IF corrective action initiated THEN punitive overlay MUST be excluded from execution flow"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that judicial authority derives not from punitive power but from the capacity to trace Dharma’s disruption through inference. The threshold for intervention lies in demonstrable causal linkage between observed consequences and underlying dharmic misalignment. Authority flows from clarity of perception, not coercive force.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse upholds pramāṇa-based causality wherein inference serves as a legitimate pathway to truth when direct observation is unavailable. It affirms anupūrvaśaḥ — that consequences emerge sequentially from root actions. Responsibility is proportional to causal proximity without invoking punitive intent. Nyaya here functions solely as a mechanism for restoring alignment with Dharma, not imposing suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate causal mapping process using available evidence to locate origin of dharmic disruption",
    "Assign responsibility based on proximity to causal root rather than assigning blame",
    "Engage completion processes to reverse deviation and restore original dharmic state",
    "Activate consciousness realignment mechanisms for all involved parties to prevent recurrence",
    "Ensure no punitive overlays interfere with restoration trajectory during implementation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This verse executes Dharma through inference-guided governance. Justice operates exclusively for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates."
