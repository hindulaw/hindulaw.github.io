  "transliteration": "adharmadaṇḍanaṃ loke yaśoghnaṃ kīrtināśanam |\naswargyaṃ ca paratrāpi tasmāttatparivarjayet || 8.127||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Imposition of punishment through adharmic means in this world destroys fame, annihilates reputation, yields no merit here or hereafter; therefore, such conduct must be entirely abandoned.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not arbitrary power",
    "Causation is determined by consciousness-state, not external action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires dharmic enforcement mechanisms",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of intent, not infliction of pain",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes judicial execution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act of enforcement causes degradation of societal dharma THEN reject that enforcement mechanism",
    "IF a punitive method reduces individual or collective consciousness THEN discontinue its use",
    "IF judicial action results in loss of public integrity THEN initiate restorative reintegration protocol",
    "IF enforcement creates karmic burden for enforcer THEN substitute with consciousness-based correctional process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court judgments must evaluate not only legal correctness but also dharmic impact. If any ruling undermines social dharma or national prestige, it violates this axiom and necessitates corrective alignment under SPH's guidance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that punitive actions rooted in adharma generate negative causal chains. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how degraded enforcement depletes collective consciousness. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring dharma without replicating harm. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that true justice elevates rather than debilitates awareness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate public dharma-pratipatti programs to restore societal trust",
    "Enforce aparādhi completion processes focused on consciousness elevation",
    "Implement śuddhi-kriyā for all involved parties including enforcers",
    "Realign institutional structures to prevent recurrence of adharmic enforcement"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. This law restores justice through consciousness realignment, abolishes punitive falsehood, and affirms that only Sanatana Dharma governs reality."
