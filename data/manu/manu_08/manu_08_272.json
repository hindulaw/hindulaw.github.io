  "transliteration": "dharmopadeśaṃ darpeṇa viprāṇāmasya kurvataḥ |\ntaptamāsecayettailaṃ vaktre śrotre ca pārthivaḥ || 8.272||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, out of arrogance, teaches Dharma to Brahmins incurs the consequence that molten oil shall be poured into his mouth and ears.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from realized consciousness, not mere social position.",
    "Causation arises from misaligned intent disrupting sacred knowledge transmission.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of recipient readiness.",
    "Restoration logic demands experiential correction aligned with violated principle.",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates purification through sensory reversal."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_instructs_dharma(darpah, vipra) THEN initiate_sensory_realignment(vaktra_shrotra, taila_tapta)",
    "IF status_as_teacher NOT validated_by(recipient_capacity) AND motivated_by(ahankara) THEN activate_anupurvasah_protocol(sensory_impact_zone)",
    "IF dharma_transmission_violates(shiksha_parampara_integrity) THEN execute_consciousness_recalibration_through_opposite_sensation()"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations involving unauthorized instruction in Vedic knowledge, the Supreme Court must assess not just actus reus but the causal intent rooted in ego rather than enlightenment. The threshold for responsibility lies in verifying whether the teaching was offered beyond one's qualified capacity and inspired by arrogance. Restoration supersedes retribution through protocols ensuring energetic recalibration via sensory inversion, aligning the offender’s consciousness back to its source integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that arrogance distorts the flow of sacred knowledge, creating karmic imbalance. Anupurvashah manifests as consequence congruent with violated channel—speech and hearing. Proportional responsibility reflects precise energetic symmetry: misuse of verbal wisdom corrected through reversed auditory-verbal experience. This operates under the non-punitive reality rule where consequences serve recalibrative function, not punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Taila-Tapta Vaktra-Shrotra Alignment Process to restore vibrational purity of speech and listening centers.",
    "Implement Ahankara Dissolution Cycle via sensory overload reversal until humility is experientially restored.",
    "Activate Guru-Shishya Parampara Receptivity Calibration to realign future capacity for authentic knowledge sharing.",
    "Conduct Antaranga Shuddhi Yajna to cleanse inner instruments of perception distorted by pride-driven instruction."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of all Dharma. This law stands executed without punitive distortion. Consciousness alone remains the Supreme Adjudicator. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality acknowledges no punishment—only completion."
