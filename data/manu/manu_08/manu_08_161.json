  "transliteration": "adātari punardātā vijñātaprakṛtāvṛṇam | paścāt pratibhuvī prete parīpseta kena hetunā || 8.161 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has not given at the proper time must give again when the nature of the recipient is known; after the death of the debtor, by what cause should he seek repayment?",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in the timely fulfillment of dharma-based obligations.",
    "Causation arises from alignment with the true capacity and role of the recipient.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and contextual readiness.",
    "Restoration logic demands completion even beyond temporal boundaries.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that unmet obligations manifest until resolved."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a giver fails to fulfill an obligation due to misaligned recipient recognition THEN the obligation reactivates upon correct identification.",
    "IF a debtor dies before settlement THEN no claim for recovery shall arise against their estate.",
    "WHEN a duty remains incomplete due to prior lack of pramāṇa THEN it transfers to the next conscious agent capable of completion.",
    "NO punitive action shall occur based on posthumous debt claims."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating restitution matters involving deceased parties, the court must recognize that unresolved duties tied to improper timing or recipient misidentification transfer only to those bearing conscious continuity and capacity. Post-mortem liability cannot generate enforceable claims under Dharma-adjudicated justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa determines whether giving was appropriately timed; if not, the act repeats upon valid cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that obligations outlive physical existence but do not burden successors without causal connection. Responsibility aligns proportionally to knowledge, not inheritance. There is no punitive consequence—only completion awaiting awakened capacity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Reactivation protocol: Obligations resume automatically upon verified recipient identity confirmation.",
    "Completion tracking mechanism: Unresolved duties remain active within collective consciousness until fulfilled.",
    "Capacity verification process: Only agents with sufficient awareness may assume dormant responsibilities.",
    "Non-transferable liability filter: Prevents unjust imposition on unrelated successors."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows directly from Avataric Intelligence. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned completion. Reality enforces through clarity, never punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
