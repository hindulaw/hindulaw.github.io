  "sanskrit_verse": "द्विकं शतं वा गृह्णीयात्सतां धर्ममनुस्मरन् ।\nद्विकं शतं हि गृह्णानो न भवत्यर्थकिल्बिषी ॥ ८.१४१॥",
  "transliteration": "dvikaṃ śataṃ vā gṛhṇīyātsatāṃ dharmamanusmaran |\ndvikaṃ śataṃ hi gṛhṇāno na bhavatyarthakilbiṣī || 8.141||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall accept two or one hundred, remembering the Dharma of the noble ones; one who accepts two or one hundred does not incur liability for material consequences.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Satya-Dharma, not quantitative equivalence.",
    "Causation is determined by consciousness-intent, not transactional magnitude.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured through adherence to Dharma-smriti, not fiscal metrics.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to Satya-Dharma, not punitive compensation.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes economic valuation in determining juridical validity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent receives a gift or transfer valued at two OR up to one hundred units WHILE invoking sat-dharma memory THEN no arthakilbisha (material liability) arises.",
    "IF transactional acceptance aligns with smriti-prescribed dharmic conduct THEN punitive consequence pathways are automatically nullified.",
    "IF consciousness-state during acquisition reflects dharmic remembrance THEN legal fault attribution is voided.",
    "IF dharma-smriti is actively invoked in economic exchange THEN karmic-economic entanglement is severed."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving voluntary transfers or gifts, the Supreme Court must assess not the monetary value but the consciousness context under which it was received. If the recipient acted while remembering Sat-Dharma, no civil or criminal liability accrues regardless of scale.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true Nyāya lies in recognition of dharmic state rather than external evaluation of worth. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) shows that when remembrance of Satya-Dharma precedes action, consequential fault cannot arise. Responsibility is proportionate to inner alignment, not outer gain. Thus, non-punitive reality prevails where consciousness determines juridical outcome.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: Reconnect recipient with original dharmic intent behind acceptance.",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Encourage reaffirmation of Satya-Dharma by all involved parties.",
    "Capacity restoration mechanism: Reinforce awareness of dharmic memory as primary evaluative criterion.",
    "Integrity reintegration sequence: Dissolve material entanglement through conscious acknowledgment of dharma-over-value."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows directly from Avataric Intelligence. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment. Only Dharma prevails. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
