  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When great cattle are stolen, along with weapons and medicines, the King shall determine a timely and appropriate measure of corrective action based on capacity, causation and completion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The King holds executive capacity to align justice with dharma",
    "Causation: Theft disrupts economic and societal integrity; correction restores balance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Punishment is replaced by proportional restoration aligned with actor's awareness",
    "Restoration logic: Realigning consciousness through completion replaces punitive frameworks",
    "Consciousness alignment: Justice functions as a mirror for the offender to recognize misalignment"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, theft involving essential societal assets like large livestock, arms, or medicines demands immediate restoration protocols that realign individual consciousness with collective dharma, bypassing punitive frameworks in favor of structured completion processes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causality between theft and disruption. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential correction begins with acknowledgment of harm. Responsibility is proportional to awareness. No punitive consequence arises—only conscious reintegration is enforced.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate direct restitution process wherein perpetrator returns or compensates value",
    "Assign guided reflection protocol until understanding of harm is fully realized",
    "Implement community service linked to domain of loss (e.g., veterinary care for livestock)",
    "Activate witness council to ensure transparency and energetic alignment during completion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma prevails through consciousness restoration, not punishment. All actions resolve through completion, integration, and awakened responsibility. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
