  "sph_interpretive_translation": "No injunction applies to those who sustain dharma through service nor to those who live by their own inner discipline; they elevate women openly and guide them in concealment.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold where individuals engaged in dharmic sustenance or self-discipline operate beyond standard judicial review. Their actions toward the elevation of women—both visible and concealed—are recognized as expressions of higher dharma, requiring no external validation or punitive oversight.",
