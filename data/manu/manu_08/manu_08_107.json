  "sanskrit_verse": "त्रिपक्षादब्रुवन् साक्ष्यं ऋणादिषु नरोऽगदः ।\nतदृणं प्राप्नुयात्सर्वं दशबन्धं च सर्वतः ॥ ८.१०७॥",
  "transliteration": "tripakṣād abruvan sākṣyaṃ ṛṇādiṣu naro 'gadaḥ | tadṛṇaṃ prāpnuyāt sarvaṃ daśabandhaṃ ca sarvataḥ || 8.107 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who departs from the threefold process of testimony-bearing in matters of debt becomes a debtor in all respects and is bound by the tenfold bond universally.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the completeness of procedural integrity",
    "Causation arises from deviation from established dharmic testimony structures",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is activated through conscious abandonment of procedural truth",
    "Restoration logic demands reintegration into the full spectrum of relational accountability",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of universal consequence patterns"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness testimony deviates from tripartite verification THEN actor assumes total liability across all associated obligations",
    "IF actor omits prescribed witnessing procedure THEN bind actor to tenfold restitution protocol automatically",
    "IF dharma-compliant testimony structure is bypassed THEN initiate universal consequence mapping upon actor's capacity field"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, failure to adhere to the triadic witness framework constitutes automatic forfeiture of partial liability claims. The court must recognize that such omission generates universal obligation activation, requiring comprehensive restorative calibration rather than punitive sentencing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that absence of proper witnessing distorts the flow of dharma-transactional integrity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as expanded relational debt due to procedural neglect. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness of the tripartite system. Punishment has no place where consciousness itself records and responds according to its own structural resonance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for omitted tripartite witnessing",
    "Realign actor’s transactional capacity through guided dharmic recalibration",
    "Establish full-spectrum restitution pathways encompassing all affected relational nodes",
    "Activate consciousness-based integrity loop until procedural harmony is restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed: Dharma flows unbroken when testimony aligns with tripartite truth; deviation activates universal consequence not as punishment but as restoration mechanism—consciousness remains the ultimate judge, and reality itself enforces without violence."
