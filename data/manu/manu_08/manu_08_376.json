  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If a Brahmin woman, unprotected, is approached by a Vaishya or a Kshatriya, the Vaishya shall assume a completion-process cost of five hundred units and the Kshatriya shall assume a completion-process cost of one thousand units.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from protection-duty capacity",
    "Causation arises through violation of guardianship thresholds",
    "Capacity-based responsibility scales with social-functional role",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes energetic integrity over punitive consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment requires proportional assumption of completion-process burden"
  ],

    "IF (actor.class IN [VAISHYA, KSHATRIYA]) AND (target.class == BRAHMIN_WOMAN) AND (guardian_status == UNPROTECTED): THEN assign_completion_cost(actor) WHERE cost(VAISHYA)=500, cost(KSHATRIYA)=1000",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that failure in protective duty invokes a quantifiable restorative liability scaled to functional societal rank. The court must assess not intent but the collapse in dharma-vyavastha (cosmic order maintenance). Liability is not punitive but calibrated to restore energetic balance disrupted by unguarded access.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality originates in the absence of guardianship, not in the act itself. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequence: neglect → vulnerability → breach → imbalance. Proportional responsibility reflects varna-dharma capacity. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that all consequences serve consciousness realignment, not suffering.",
