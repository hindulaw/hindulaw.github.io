  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those whose livelihood arises from hunting, bird-catching, herding, fishing, root-gathering, serpent-catching, scavenging, or wandering in forests—these persons are designated as living by marginal survival techniques and must be restored to integrated societal participation through capacity-building.",
