  "transliteration": "yo'dattādāyino hastāt lipset brāhmaṇo dhanam |\nyājanādhyāpanenāpi yathā stenas tathaiva saḥ || 8.340 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brāhmaṇa who seeks to acquire wealth from the hands of one who has not given it—through performance of sacrifices or teaching—is to be understood as a thief in the same manner.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in alignment with Dharma, not ritual status alone",
    "Causation is established through intent to extract unearned value",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of spiritual-economic integrity",
    "Restoration logic demands cessation of exploitative transactional patterns",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification of instrumental relationships"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor_is_brāhmaṇa AND action_is_seeking_ungranted_wealth THEN status_is_theft_equivalent",
    "IF transaction_occurs_without_reciprocal_dharma THEN validity_is_void",
    "IF teaching_or_ritual_used_as_exploitation THEN consequence_is_restitution_mandatory",
    "IF actor_disregards_giving_principle THEN eligibility_for_sacred_function_is_revoked",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving misuse of sacred roles for material gain, the Supreme Court must assess whether the conduct aligns with the foundational dharmic exchange principle. The threshold of responsibility lies in the absence of genuine reciprocity and presence of coercive extraction under guise of ritual service.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that seeking ungiven wealth violates the causal structure of dharma-based exchange. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how instrumentalization of sacred function leads to systemic distortion. Proportional responsibility arises from the degree of deviation from true giving. Non-punitive reality ensures correction occurs through realignment rather than infliction of harm.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein all improperly acquired assets are returned or compensated",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol requiring public acknowledgment and renunciation of exploitative behavior",
    "Enforce capacity restoration via supervised reintegration into community service without financial benefit",
    "Activate integrity reintegration program focused on relearning principles of dharmic exchange and sacred duty"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law originates solely from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice flows exclusively toward restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment; there is only awakening. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
