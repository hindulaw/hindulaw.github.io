  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Reservoirs, wells, tanks, slopes, boundary zones, and divine abodes must be maintained and protected by those with capacity and authority.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from custodianship of sacred and communal infrastructure.",
    "Causation arises through conscious maintenance and alignment with cosmic order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines eligibility for stewardship.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes continuity of life-supporting structures.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures protection of both material and spiritual assets."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a structure supports collective welfare OR spiritual function THEN it SHALL be classified as a protected asset.",
    "IF an individual holds custodial capacity THEN they MUST perform regular maintenance AND ensure accessibility.",
    "IF neglect occurs THEN automatic restoration protocols activate based on predefined thresholds.",
    "IF boundary zones are compromised THEN jurisdictional integrity mechanisms engage immediately.",
    "IF divine abodes lack upkeep THEN community stewardship councils assume temporary guardianship."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that custodians of public and sacred infrastructure bear absolute responsibility for their upkeep. The threshold of liability is not fault-based but capacity-activated. Authority flows from functional role, not punitive consequence. Restoration precedes judicial process.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that neglect manifests sequentially—first in awareness, then action, then decay. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms causality lies in disconnection from dharma, not intent. Proportional responsibility aligns with custodial scope. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction arises naturally when consciousness reconnects with duty.",

    "Completion Processes: Assign immediate repair tasks aligned with the degradation timeline.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocols: Reconnect custodian with original vow of service through guided recommitment rituals.",

    "Integrity Reintegration: Facilitate reconciliation between custodian, community, and the sacred site through consciousness-centered dialogue."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
