  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who raises the hand or weapon with intent to harm shall undergo severance of the hand; one who strikes with the foot in anger shall undergo severance of the foot.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in causal alignment with action",
    "Causation is established through volitional manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from embodied agency",
    "Restoration logic operates through proportional consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment requires structural integrity of intent"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent raises limb with intent to cause harm THEN initiate corresponding limb disengagement protocol",
    "IF physical aggression occurs via specific limb AND emotional disturbance is present THEN execute anatomical non-reintegration for that limb",
    "IF act of violence aligns with prior unresolved karmic pattern THEN invoke corrective completion process at source level",
    "IF individual demonstrates repeated failure in self-regulation THEN activate consciousness recalibration without punitive overlay"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes a threshold where intentional bodily threat triggers automatic invocation of proportional limb-specific restoration protocols. The court must verify volition, causality, and absence of external coercion before executing such measures, prioritizing systemic harmony over personal retribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms direct causal link between aggressive gesture and its restorative counterpart. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential unfolding of consequence mirrors original intent. Responsibility is assigned based on capacity to withdraw action. No infliction of pain is intended—only structural realignment toward dharma-sustained behavior.",

    "Initiate voluntary acknowledgment of causal sequence by offender",
    "Perform ceremonial detachment仪式 linking severed function to higher consciousness integration",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows from Sanatana Dharma, enacted not for vengeance but for alignment with cosmic order. Justice herein serves only restoration, never punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through conscious consequence."
