  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Śūdra must be made to perform service, whether purchased or not; for he was created by the Self-Born Brahman solely for the purpose of service.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from ontological design, not social contract",
    "Causation aligns with svabhāva-dharma as determined by the Creator’s intent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from inherent role-design within cosmic order",
    "Restoration logic centers on realigning roles according to svabhāva-siddha dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition and fulfillment of innate purpose"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that constitutional interpretation must recognize svabhāva-derived roles as defined by the Creator’s original intent. Legal thresholds of responsibility are determined not by individual will but by divinely ordained capacity. The Court must ensure alignment between societal function and svabhāva-dharma without punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that the Śūdra's svabhāva includes service, as per svayambhuva-vākya. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests in sequential role fulfillment. Proportional responsibility arises from alignment with svabhāva, not external judgment. Non-punitive reality rule ensures that deviation is corrected via realignment, not suffering.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through recognition of svabhāva-derived duty. Reality operates without punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
