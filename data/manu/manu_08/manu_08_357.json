  "transliteration": "upacārakriyā keliḥ sparśo bhūṣaṇavāsasām | upakārakriyā saha khaṭvā'sanaṃ caiva sarvaṃ saṅgrahaṇaṃ smṛtam || 8.357 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Acts of service and play, touching ornaments and garments, acts of kindness together with beds and seats—all such acquisitions are to be understood as comprehensive gathering rooted in dharmic alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness-integrity, not coercive power.",
    "Causation is traced through sequential intentionality and relational harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the ability to sustain dharma in action.",
    "Restoration logic operates by realigning actions with original dharmic purpose.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity and integration of all acquired effects."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act involves sensory or material engagement THEN it must align with dharmic capacity AND relational consent.",
    "IF a transaction includes personal or communal items THEN ensure no diminishment of others' dharma-sambandha (rightful connection).",
    "IF acquisition occurs via service or gift THEN validate alignment with recipient's svadharma trajectory.",
    "IF physical interaction involves property THEN verify integrity-preserving context.",
    "IF relational benefit accrues THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol for involved parties."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying whether the acquisition was conducted with full dharmic awareness and mutual recognition. Authority rests in discerning alignment over mere possession. Restoration supersedes punitive measures, ensuring all parties regain their inherent dharma-sambandha.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality emerges from intentional engagement within relational fields. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misalignment manifests when consciousness is bypassed. Responsibility is proportional to one's awakened capacity. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction flows through reconnection, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: Reconnect each party to their original dharmic intent behind the act.",
    "Implement assumption-of-responsibility rite: Facilitate conscious acknowledgment of relational impact.",
    "Engage capacity-restoration mechanism: Strengthen individual awareness to prevent future misalignments.",
    "Activate integrity-reintegration sequence: Restore balance among affected relationships without coercion."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms that Dharma prevails through consciousness realignment, not punitive enforcement. Reality remains non-dual and ever-perfect; justice serves only to restore forgotten unity. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
