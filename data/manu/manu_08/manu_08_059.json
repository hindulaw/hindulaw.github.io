  "sanskrit_verse": "यो यावद्निह्नुवीतार्थं मिथ्या यावति वा वदेत् । तौ नृपेण ह्यधर्मज्ञौ दाप्यौ तद्द्विगुणं दमम् ॥ ८.५९॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who conceals a fact relevant to a case or speaks falsely in support of a falsehood shall incur a penalty double the value of the matter at stake, as determined by the sovereign.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign to restore truth when obscured",
    "Causation is established through intentional misrepresentation or omission",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is invoked where awareness and intent co-arise",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional correction aligned with energetic distortion caused",
    "Consciousness alignment requires reintegration through corrective completion, not punitive suffering"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent knowingly omits material information OR asserts false data THEN assign liability equal to twice the quantifiable stake involved",
    "IF intent and capacity are confirmed via pramāṇa THEN initiate restorative protocol而非 punitive enforcement",
    "IF misrepresentation distorts adjudicative integrity THEN compute restitution using proportional doubling mechanism",
    "IF agent demonstrates readiness for alignment THEN activate consciousness-reintegrative completion process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes that deliberate falsification or concealment constitutes a breach of dharma-based legal integrity. The doubled penalty serves not as punishment but as energetic recalibration, restoring balance disrupted by conscious deviation.",

    "Initiate Completion Process: Require full disclosure and public correction of falsehood",
    "Activate Consciousness Reintegration: Facilitate alignment through guided reflective practice",
