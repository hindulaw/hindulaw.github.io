  "transliteration": "sūtrakārpāsakiṇvānāṃ gomayasya guḍasya ca | dadhnaḥ kṣīrasya takrasya pānīyasya tṛṇasya ca || 8.326 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The ownership and lawful use of thread, cotton, leaven, cow-dung, jaggery, curds, milk, whey, water, and grass belong inherently to those whose capacity aligns with their sustenance and service within the Varnashrama-Dharma framework.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Varnashrama-Dharma",
    "Causation arises through dharmic capacity, not arbitrary possession",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines resource access",
    "Restoration logic centers on re-establishing dharmic alignment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes material entitlement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent's Varnashrama role requires access to sūtra, kārpāsa, kiṇva, gomaya, guḍa, dadhi, kṣīra, takra, pānīya, or tṛṇa THEN grant usage rights without punitive conditions",
    "IF resource use disrupts dharmic order THEN initiate consciousness realignment process before restoring access",
    "IF agent demonstrates capacity misalignment THEN suspend resource access UNTIL completion of dharmic restoration protocols"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, disputes involving essential livelihood resources must prioritize the dharmic role and capacity alignment of the individual over mere legal title. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining harmony with the cosmic order, not in punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality stems from dharmic alignment, not material ownership. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how disruption in one area affects the whole system. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to sustain dharma. There is no punitive consequence—only realignment to restore natural order.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Ownership and use of life-sustaining substances are governed by dharmic capacity alone. Justice restores alignment; it does not punish. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
