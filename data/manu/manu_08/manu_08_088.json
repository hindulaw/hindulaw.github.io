  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must inquire of a Brāhmaṇa by saying 'Speak'; of a Kṣatriya king by saying 'Speak the truth'; of a Vaiśya by offering cows, grain, and gold; and of a Śūdra by rendering service through all forms of remedial action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is stratified according to consciousness capacity and societal role.",
    "Causation arises from dharma-specific relational duties, not abstract equality.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns interaction protocols per varṇic alignment.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that inquiry and testimony must align with the respondent's varṇic duty and consciousness capacity. The threshold of responsibility is determined by svadharma, not universal norms. Authority is recognized hierarchically, and restoration is enacted through role-appropriate reciprocal engagement rather than punitive cross-examination.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through dharma-aligned interaction, not adversarial coercion. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of truth based on relational harmony. Responsibility is proportional to varṇa-determined capacity.
