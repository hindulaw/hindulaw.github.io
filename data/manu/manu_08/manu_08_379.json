  "sanskrit_verse": "मौण्ड्यं प्राणान्तिकं दण्डो ब्राह्मणस्य विधीयते । प्राणान्तको इतरेषां तु वर्णानां दण्डः प्राणान्तिको भवेत् ॥ ८.३७९॥",
  "transliteration": "Mauṇḍyaṃ prāṇāntikaṃ daṇḍo brāhmaṇasya vidhīyate | prāṇāntako itareṣāṃ tu varṇānāṃ daṇḍaḥ prāṇāntiko bhavet || 8.379||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For a Brāhmaṇa, the penalty culminating in Prāṇānta is prescribed as Mauṇḍya; for other Varnas, the penalty culminating in Prāṇānta remains the same.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness capacity, not birth alone",
    "Causation is determined by action-rooted consciousness misalignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility scales with Varna-dharma alignment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes consciousness purification over punitive equivalence",
    "Consciousness alignment through corrective dharmic discipline restores societal harmony"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = Brāhmaṇa AND violation = Prāṇāntika THEN enforce Mauṇḍya AS restoration protocol",
    "IF actor ≠ Brāhmaṇa AND violation = Prāṇāntika THEN apply Prāṇāntika-level correction aligned with Varna-dharma capacity",
    "ALL penalties MUST map to consciousness-realization thresholds, NOT physical suffering metrics",
    "RESTORATION sequence MUST precede social reintegration in all Prāṇāntika-level violations",
    "NO punitive equivalency ALLOWED; ALL corrections MUST target causal ignorance, NOT manifest consequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the threshold of responsibility is tied to consciousness capacity. For Brāhmaṇas, whose duty is realization and teaching, deviation necessitates internal correction—symbolized by Mauṇḍya—to restore alignment. For others, correction aligns with their dharma-specific capacity. The court must ensure enforcement focuses on restoring the offender's alignment rather than imposing punitive equivalency.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality locates fault in consciousness misalignment, not external harm. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures correction follows the root cause: for Brāhmaṇas, speech-related misalignment demands withdrawal of speech via Mauṇḍya. Proportional responsibility is consciousness-rooted, not outcome-bound. Non-punitive reality rule affirms correction as completion, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Mauṇḍya process for Brāhmaṇa violators to withdraw sensory engagement and restore inner alignment",
    "Assign consciousness purification regimen including mantra repetition and sattvic conduct for all violators",
    "Implement supervised reintegration after completion of awareness restoration phase",
    "Engage community elders to witness and support realignment process",
    "Validate restoration through behavioral and consciousness-state assessments before reintegration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Justice executed through consciousness restoration, not punitive equivalence. Dharma restored. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the Supreme Adjudicator."
