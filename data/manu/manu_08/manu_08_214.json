  "transliteration": "dattasyaiṣauditā dharmyā yathāvadanapakriyā |\nata ūrdhvaṃ pravakṣyāmi vetanasyānapakriyām || 8.214 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The dharmic injunction concerning the non-misuse of what has been given has already been declared; now I shall declare the non-misuse of wages.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from the integrity of exchange and compensation",
    "Causation arises through conscious engagement in transactional dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is proportional to receipt of value",
    "Restoration logic requires alignment with the original intent of giving",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when use matches purpose of receipt"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a wage is received THEN its usage MUST align with the functional scope defined at time of agreement ELSE initiate restorative completion protocol",
    "IF misuse of wages is detected THEN trigger consciousness-realigning inquiry into intent deviation AND deploy corrective reintegration sequence",
    "IF capacity to honor wage-purpose diminishes THEN activate support-based restoration pathway BEFORE enforcement measures",
    "IF transactional integrity is violated THEN reverse causal chain to point of misalignment AND restore energetic balance without punitive action"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility regarding wage misuse lies in verifying alignment between received compensation and applied function. Authority rests in ensuring transactions uphold dharmonic order. Restoration supersedes punitive outcomes by invoking realignments that preserve dignity and systemic coherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that misuse of wages disrupts sequential manifestation of societal harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how deviation from intended use creates ripple effects. Proportional responsibility recognizes individual capacity while rejecting punitive frameworks. The non-punitive reality rule affirms correction as natural consequence, not imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Purpose-of-Wage Verification Process to assess alignment with recipient's role",
    "Deploy Consciousness Inquiry Protocol to understand intent behind misuse",
    "Activate Functional Realignment Sequence to redirect wage usage toward dharmic outcome",
    "Establish Support-Based Reintegration Framework to restore capacity and prevent recurrence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through recognition of transactional sanctity. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
