  "transliteration": "āgamaṁ nirgamaṁ sthānaṁ tathā vṛddhikṣayāvubhau |\nvicārya sarvapaṇyānāṁ kārayetkrayavikrayau || 8.401||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having examined the inflow, outflow, location, and both increase and decrease of all commodities, one shall execute purchase and sale.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from comprehensive observation and alignment with natural economic flow",
    "Causation arises through conscious engagement with systemic material dynamics",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires full spectrum awareness before transactional action",
    "Restoration logic ensures balance between acquisition and relinquishment",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates that commerce reflect dharmic integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a transaction involves commodity X THEN prior evaluation of āgama-nirgama-sthāna-vṛddhi-kṣaya must occur",
    "IF evaluation incomplete THEN transaction initiation disallowed",
    "IF discrepancy in vṛddhi-kṣaya observed THEN mandatory restorative audit triggered",
    "IF sthāna (location) misaligned with dharma THEN realignment protocol initiated",
    "IF agent demonstrates causal unawareness THEN capacity restoration process enforced"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes the threshold of commercial responsibility as total systemic visibility. Adjudication must verify whether parties have fully evaluated the origin, destination, accumulation, and diminution of goods. Where negligence occurs, restoration precedes judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that transactions unexamined in their full context generate disorder. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how imbalance manifests when vṛddhi-kṣaya are ignored. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of conscious engagement. Non-punitive reality holds that correction restores dharma without infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Reconstruct āgama-nirgama-vṛddhi-kṣaya data for unresolved transactions",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require actor to re-enact transaction with full evaluative awareness",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide tools for accurate assessment of systemic economic flows",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align future trade practices with sequential dharmic visibility"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Commerce aligned with dharma restores balance. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
