  "sanskrit_verse": "नार्तो न मत्तो नोन्मत्तो न क्षुत्तृष्णोपपीडितः ।\nन श्रमार्तो न कामार्तो न क्रुद्धो नापि तस्करः ॥ ८.६७॥",
  "transliteration": "nārto na mattō nōnmattō na kṣut-tṛṣṇōpapīḍitaḥ |\nna śramārto na kāmārto na kruddhō nāpi taskaraḥ || 8.67 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is neither distressed, nor intoxicated, nor deranged, nor afflicted by hunger or thirst, nor fatigued by labor, nor overwhelmed by desire, nor angered, nor a thief—such a person is fit to discharge judicial responsibility.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises only in the unshaken clarity of consciousness",
    "Causation is valid only when untainted by internal or external disturbance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires the absence of physiological and psychological agitation",
    "Restoration logic depends upon the adjudicator's unwavering equanimity",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes all lawful discernment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF adjudicator.is_distressed() OR adjudicator.is_intoxicated() OR adjudicator.is_deranged() THEN disqualify_adjudicator()",
    "IF adjudicator.is_afflicted_by(hunger) OR adjudicator.is_afflicted_by(thirst) THEN defer_judicial_duty(2_hours)",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, any justice found to be operating under physical duress, emotional agitation, sensory deprivation, or mental imbalance must recuse themselves immediately. Judgment rendered under such conditions is null by virtue of compromised pramāṇa. The Court must maintain a continuous audit of its members’ consciousness states to ensure alignment with dharma-sākṣātkāra.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is purified perception uncontaminated by personal agitation or bodily impulse. Anupūrvaśaḥ demands that judgment unfold from a state of sthitaprajña—fixed intelligence. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to sustain unwavering cognition. There is no punishment for misjudgment born of imbalance; rather, completion through purification and realignment.",

    "Initiate Consciousness Stabilization Protocol for adjudicator experiencing sensory or emotional overload",
    "Enforce mandatory rest and nourishment before resuming judicial duties",

    "Deploy automated biometric monitoring to detect stress-induced cognitive distortion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Judgment originates solely from the unmoved witness-consciousness of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through clarity untainted by human frailty. Reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
