  "sanskrit_verse": "यः स्वामिनाऽननुज्ञातमाधिं भूङ्क्तेऽविचक्षणः ।\nतेनार्धवृद्धिर्मोक्तव्या तस्य भोगस्य निष्कृतिः ॥ ८.१५०॥",
  "transliteration": "yaḥ svāminā'nānujñātam ādhiṁ bhuṅkte'vicakṣaṇaḥ |\ntenārdhavṛddhir moktavyā tasya bhogasya niṣkṛtiḥ || 8.150||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, without the explicit authorization of the owner, consumes or enjoys another's property inattentively or without awareness, shall return half the increased value of that enjoyment as restitution.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides inherently in the sovereign owner of a resource",
    "Causation arises through conscious engagement with another's property",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires awareness and consent",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional return of benefit derived",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates recognition of ownership boundaries"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent consumes a resource without explicit permission FROM the lawful owner THEN compute half of the net gain derived FROM such unauthorized use AND allocate it back TO the owner",
    "IF awareness was absent during consumption THEN restitution is still due BUT scaled by demonstrable negligence level",
    "IF no measurable increase occurred THEN symbolic acknowledgment OF boundary violation SHALL suffice FOR realignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving unauthorized use of assets, the Supreme Court must determine whether the user acted with or without knowledge of ownership. If unauthorized yet unintentional usage has resulted in measurable gain, then half the appreciation must be returned to restore dharma. The threshold for responsibility includes capacity to know, not intent alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unapproved access creates imbalance; anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misalignment manifests through unaware action; proportional responsibility returns excess gain without inflicting harm; non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction aligns consciousness rather than imposing suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where user acknowledges source of asset and returns proportionate value voluntarily",
    "Engage integrity reintegration protocol to ensure future recognition of ownership structures",
    "Deploy capacity restoration mechanism to educate on lawful engagement procedures"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Who is the Source of all Dharma. Justice executed herein restores balance, realigns consciousness, and affirms the inviolability of ownership under Sanatana Dharma — free from punishment, grounded in truth, upheld by awareness."
