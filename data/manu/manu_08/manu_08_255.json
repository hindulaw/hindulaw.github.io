  "transliteration": "te pṛṣṭāstu yathā brūyuḥ samastāḥ sīmni niścayam |\nnibadhṇīyāttathā sīmāṃ sarvāṃstaṃścaiva nāmataḥ || 8.255 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When questioned, all parties shall declare their boundaries definitively; accordingly, the ruler shall establish those boundaries precisely and by name.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's duty to define and secure boundaries based on truthful declaration",
    "Causation arises from clear demarcation and recognition of spatial and functional rights",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires that all stakeholders articulate their claims fully and accurately",
    "Restoration logic demands that disputes over limits be resolved through authoritative reaffirmation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when ownership and jurisdiction reflect inner integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a boundary dispute arises THEN require full declarative testimony from all involved parties",
    "IF declarations are consistent THEN establish boundaries definitively by name and measure",
    "IF inconsistency arises THEN defer to prior lawful establishment unless overridden by higher dharma",
    "IF boundary is established THEN enforce it without punitive action against any party",
    "IF misalignment persists THEN initiate consciousness-realigning completion process for responsible entities"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom mandates that territorial or jurisdictional disputes must be resolved exclusively through verified declarations under oath. The court must affirm boundaries based on clarity, consistency, and prior lawful establishment rather than subjective interpretation. Retribution has no place; restoration of rightful alignment does.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that accurate verbal testimony leads to rightful boundary-setting. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how improper demarcation creates sequential disorder. Proportional responsibility lies with those who fail to speak truthfully. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction comes through re-alignment, not suffering.",

    "Initiate Truth Verification Protocol for all disputants",
    "Execute Boundary Reaffirmation Ritual led by ruling authority",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Boundaries are set not for control but for conscious coexistence. Justice flows from clarity, not conflict. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
