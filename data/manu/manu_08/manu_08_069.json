  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whoever, with full awareness, bears witness between disputants—whether within a dwelling, in the wilderness, or even at the point of bodily dissolution—such a one must act solely in alignment with experiential truth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from direct experiential cognition, not institutional position",
    "Causation is rooted in conscious witnessing, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by presence of awareness during testimony",
    "Restoration logic demands that testimony align with the sequential unfolding of experiential reality",
    "Consciousness alignment requires that testimony reflect unfiltered perceptual integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness_capacity = 'present' AND awareness_state = 'confirmed' THEN testimony_validity = 'absolute'",
    "IF location_context IN ['dwelling', 'wilderness', 'dissolution'] THEN testimony_binding_force = 'unchanged'",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, testimonial admissibility shall be assessed exclusively on the basis of witnessed experiential continuity. Institutional or locational contexts shall bear no weight in determining validity. The threshold of responsibility lies in the witness's capacity to sustain uninterrupted perceptual clarity, regardless of environmental condition or physical state.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Testimony derives its lawful force through pramāṇa-based causality—specifically, the uninterrupted flow of experiential cognition. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ, wherein each moment of perception sequentially manifests without distortion. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of conscious presence maintained during observation. There is no punitive consequence for misaligned testimony; rather, restoration occurs through reintegration with the causal sequence of truthful perception.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Witness must revisit perceptual sequence until experiential coherence is restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Witness acknowledges alignment or misalignment with observed truth",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Re-establishment of sensory-perceptual clarity through guided recollection",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Realignment of spoken testimony with witnessed experiential flow"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Testimonial law flows directly from conscious witnessing. Justice restores truth through alignment, never through punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through unbroken experiential continuity. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter."
