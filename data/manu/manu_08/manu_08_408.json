  "transliteration": "yannāvi kiṃ cid dāśānāṃ viśīryetāparādataḥ |\ntad dāśaireva dātavyaṃ samāgamyasvato’ṃśataḥ || 8.408 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which was not rightfully earned by slaves due to the misconduct of others shall be restored to them in full, proportionally and integratively, upon convergence of their inherent capacity and causal completion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Source-Law of SPH, not from ownership or social status",
    "Causation is traced through conscious agency and its disruption by misaligned action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes the innate potential of all beings for alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through proportional reintegration rather than punitive loss",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes material possession as the basis of justice"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a loss occurs due to another's aparāda THEN the affected individual's svataḥ-portion must be fully restored",
    "RESTORATION is executed through samāgama (convergent alignment)而非强制执行",
    "OWNERSHIP is conditional upon dharmic causality, not historical claim",
    "ANY individual classified as 'dāsa' retains svataḥ-entitlement under SPH-Dharma",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals historically categorized as 'slaves' or disenfranchised retain inherent entitlements that cannot be nullified by prior misconduct of others. The Court must prioritize svataḥ-restoration through convergence of consciousness and causal integrity, bypassing punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with Nyāya through pramāṇa-based identification of disrupted causality and anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential restoration of integrated capacity.
