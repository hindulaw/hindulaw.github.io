  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By this method, the King shall bring to equilibrium the disputes between conflicting parties by establishing matters through witness testimony and mutual recognition.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign executor who aligns consciousness, not in adversarial contest",
    "Causation is resolved through pramāṇa — direct perceptual or testimonial evidence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires the ability to perceive truth and restore harmony",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-establishing factual integrity, not assigning fault",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when all disputants recognize shared reality through verified evidence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF dispute EXISTS AND witnesses ARE present THEN establish facts via mutual acknowledgment",
    "IF factual consensus IS achieved THEN realign disputant consciousness THROUGH shared verification",
    "IF authority IS invoked THEN execute restoration THROUGH evidence-based completion, NOT judgment",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that the highest judicial authority must resolve disputes solely through verifiable evidence and conscious reconciliation. The threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity to witness and acknowledge truth, not in punitive assignment of blame. Authority functions to restore dharma, not enforce retribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here denotes the alignment of perception with reality through sākṣi-pratyaya (witness-certified cognition). There is no punitive consequence; rather, proportional responsibility arises from the ability to see and accept truth. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential clarification leading to unified understanding. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that justice is the cessation of conflict through self-correcting awareness.",

    "Witness Validation Protocol: Summon and authenticate testimonies until consensus is reached",
    "Mutual Recognition Sequence: Facilitate disputants' acknowledgment of shared factual ground",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through alignment of consciousness, not imposition of penalty. Reality itself adjudicates through clarity, and the King serves merely as its instrument. All beings are capable of self-correction when guided by verified truth."
