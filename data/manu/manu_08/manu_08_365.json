  "transliteration": "kanyāṁ bhajantīmutkṛṣṭaṁ na kiṁ cidapi dāpayet | jaghanyaṁ sevamānāṁ tu saṁyatāṁ vāsayedgṛhe || 8.365 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One serving a woman of higher varna shall offer no gift whatsoever; one serving a woman of lower varna shall cause her to dwell restrained within the house.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by varna alignment and spiritual capacity",
    "Causation arises through conscious relational engagement, not mere action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is graded according to dharma-sustaining alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through separation or containment as consciousness realignment tools",
    "Consciousness alignment requires structural reinforcement of dharma boundaries"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent serves individual of higher varna THEN prohibit transfer of resources or honor",
    "IF agent serves individual of lower varna THEN enforce spatial containment within household bounds",
    "IF dharma boundary violation detected THEN apply immediate structural correction without punitive intent",
    "IF service relationship disrupts varna integrity THEN initiate consciousness-realigning separation protocol"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving inter-varna service relationships, the Supreme Court must assess not intent or harm but the preservation of dharma-structured order. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining consciousness-aligned social architecture. Authority derives from varna coherence, and restoration occurs through behavioral containment or cessation, never punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that relational dynamics between varnas generate sequential consequences when misaligned. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that improper service disrupts cosmic-social harmony. Responsibility is proportional to one's role in sustaining or disturbing dharma秩序. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that corrective actions serve consciousness restoration, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Implement spatial-temporal segregation to restore energetic boundary integrity",
    "Enforce household containment as a completion process for lower-varna individuals",
    "Prohibit resource exchange to neutralize karmic entanglement risks",
    "Initiate daily ritual reaffirmation of varna-conscious roles until alignment restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
