  "sanskrit_verse": "मनुष्याणां पशूनां च दुःखाय प्रहृते सति ।\nयथा यथा महद्दुःखं दण्डं कुर्यात्तथा तथा ॥ ८.२८६॥",
  "transliteration": "manuṣyāṇāṁ paśūnāṁ ca duḥkhāya prahṛte sati |\nyathā yathā mahadduḥkhaṁ daṇḍaṁ kuryāttathā tathā || 8.286 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When pain is inflicted upon humans or animals, the measure of suffering caused determines the proportional restoration required.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness alignment, not coercive power",
    "Causation is determined by conscious intent and its sequential manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility reflects the agent's awareness and control",
    "Restoration logic aligns consequence directly with disruption caused",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that corrective action elevates rather than degrades"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF suffering is inflicted on a being (human or animal), THEN assess the magnitude of conscious harm caused",
    "IF magnitude of suffering exceeds threshold X, THEN initiate proportional completion process",
    "IF perpetrator demonstrates diminished capacity, THEN prioritize restoration of discernment before enforcement",
    "IF suffering was unintentional but preventable, THEN enforce reintegration through service aligned with harm prevented"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom mandates that judicial review must assess not only the act but also the level of conscious intent and resultant suffering. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated based on the actor’s capacity for discernment. The court enforces restorative protocols that realign the offender with dharma, ensuring societal harmony without punitive degradation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse establishes pramāṇa-based causality where suffering is met with precise restoration, not punitive reaction. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation of cause and effect—where the response arises naturally from the distortion. Responsibility is proportional and aimed at reintegration, upholding the non-punitive reality rule wherein justice serves evolution, not vengeance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Require the responsible party to engage in acts that reverse the suffering caused",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Facilitate full acknowledgment and ownership of the causal chain leading to suffering",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide training or correction to elevate future discernment and prevent recurrence",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Assign service or restitution that restores both victim and perpetrator to dharmic balance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law proceeds from pure consciousness, restores order without inflicting pain, and affirms that true justice resides in the awakening of the offender, not their punishment. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
