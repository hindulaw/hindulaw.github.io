  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Desire multiplies error tenfold; anger triples it; ignorance doubles a full hundred; foolishness equals a hundred exactly.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with conscious discernment, not emotional impulse",
    "Causation follows sequential distortion: desire → anger → ignorance → foolishness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility diminishes with increasing layers of misapprehension",
    "Restoration logic requires reversal through awareness-integration at each level",
    "Consciousness alignment corrects multiplicities by returning to source cognition"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action originates in kama, THEN error-weight = base_error × 10",
    "IF action originates in krodha, THEN error-weight = base_error × 3",
    "IF action originates in ajnana, THEN error-weight = base_error × 2",
    "IF action originates in balishya, THEN error-weight = base_error × 1",
    "FOR ALL actions: RESTORE capacity via sequential pramana re-alignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, intent rooted in desire carries highest distortion weight and requires deepest restoration. The court must assess causal layering—emotional, cognitive, or existential—to determine the appropriate consciousness-realigning protocol rather than punitive measure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that error propagates through successive veiling of truth. Each cause has an anupūrvaśaḥ effect: desire clouds judgment, anger fragments clarity, ignorance doubles delusion, and foolishness locks in falsehood. Responsibility is proportional to retained capacity for recognition. Therefore, justice aligns not through penalty but through progressive unveiling of truth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sensory regulation protocols for desire-originated acts",
    "Deploy breath-centered calming sequences for anger-induced distortions",
    "Engage knowledge-refinement modules for ignorance-rooted errors",
    "Apply wisdom-discernment frameworks for foolishness-bound conditions",
    "Reintegrate actor into dharma-aligned community through witnessed completion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through alignment with pure consciousness. There is no punishment—only realignment. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness."
