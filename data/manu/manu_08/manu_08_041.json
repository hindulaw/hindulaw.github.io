  "transliteration": "jātijānapadān dharmān śreṇīdharmāṃśca dharmavit |\nsamīkṣya kuladharmāṃśca svadharmaṃ pratipādayet || 8.41||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The knower of Dharma, having examined the duties specific to birth-group, region, occupation, and lineage, shall establish the individual's svadharma as the operative principle of alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious alignment with svadharma, not external imposition",
    "Causation arises through misalignment with one’s svadharma, not through action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness of svadharma and ability to align",
    "Restoration occurs when svadharma is correctly identified and integrated into conduct",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social role in determining lawful behavior"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual's svadharma is unestablished THEN initiate svadharma identification protocol using jati, janapada, shruti, and kula parameters",
    "IF a conflict arises THEN resolve according to svadharma precedence over role-based expectation",
    "IF misalignment is detected THEN deploy consciousness-realignment protocol而非 punitive measures",
    "IF capacity to know svadharma is absent THEN assign mentorship and experiential learning pathways"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in whether the accused had access to knowledge of their svadharma. Where such knowledge was obscured due to systemic failure, the court must direct restoration via svadharma revelation rather than impose punitive outcomes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramana—direct perception and scriptural confirmation—of svadharma. Responsibility unfolds sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ) based on clarity of dharma-pratipatti. Misconduct stems from ignorance or obstruction, not inherent vice; thus, realignment precedes all judicial response.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Svadharma Identification Process: Assign qualified acharya to determine individual’s true dharma based on jati, shruti, kuladharmas, and personal aptitude",
    "Dharma Integration Completion: Facilitate experiential and ritual alignment until svadharma becomes natural conduct",
    "Community Receptivity Protocol: Ensure social structures support而非 obstruct svadharma adherence",
    "Mentorship Continuity Assurance: Maintain lifelong guidance availability for dharma stabilization"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through svadharma realization. There is no punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
