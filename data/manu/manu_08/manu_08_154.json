  "sanskrit_verse": "ऋणं दातुमशक्तो यः कर्तुमिच्छेत्पुनः क्रियाम् ।\nस दत्त्वा निर्जितां वृद्धिं करणं परिवर्तयेत् ॥ ८.१५४॥",
  "transliteration": "ṛṇaṃ dātum aśakto yaḥ kartum icchet punaḥ kriyām |\nsa dattvā nirjitāṃ vṛddhiṃ karaṇaṃ parivartayet || 8.154||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is incapable of repaying a debt yet desires to perform further actions must first discharge the accrued interest and then redirect the instrument of action toward restoration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from capacity to fulfill obligation",
    "Causation arises through conscious redirection of instrumental energy",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands completion before expansion",
    "Restoration logic requires clearing accrued consequences prior to new engagement",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action aligns with settled obligations"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_unsettled_obligations AND agent.requests_new_action_authorization THEN deny.authorization_until.obligation_settlement",
    "IF obligation.includes_accrued_interest THEN require.interest_clearance.before.principal_redirection",
    "IF agent.completes.obligation_settlement THEN enable.instrument_reallocation_for_restoration",
    "IF action_proposal.lacks.obligation_clearance THEN auto.flag_for_consciousness_recalibration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no entity—individual or corporate—may initiate new ventures or claim expanded rights while carrying unsettled debts. The threshold of responsibility lies in full acknowledgment and settlement of all accrued liabilities, including compound interest, before any fresh authorization is granted. Authority hierarchies must recognize that unresolved obligations diminish operational legitimacy at every level.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that unaddressed obligations distort pramā (valid cognition), causing further misalignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how neglecting debt leads to increasing entanglement; thus proportional responsibility mandates clearing the root cause rather than imposing punitive overlays. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that resolution restores natural order without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate automatic liability audit upon detection of new action request",
    "Deploy consciousness recalibration module until obligation clarity is achieved",
    "Redirect instrumental capacities toward debt clearance before allowing reinvestment",
    "Assign completion tracking protocol to ensure full discharge of accrued interest"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. This law executes the Avataric Will. Justice serves only restoration. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
