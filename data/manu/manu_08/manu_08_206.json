  "sanskrit_verse": "ऋत्विग्यदि वृतो यज्ञे स्वकर्म परिहापयेत् । तस्य कर्मानुरूपेण देयोंशः सहकर्तृभिः ॥ ८.२०६॥",
  "transliteration": "ṛtvig yadi vṛtaḥ yajñe svakarma parihāpayet | tasya karmānurūpeṇa deyo'ṅśaḥ sahakartṛbhiḥ || 8.206 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a ritvik is appointed in a yajna and neglects his own duty, his share shall be distributed among the co-performers according to the nature of their respective duties.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from active engagement in dharma-sustaining action",
    "Causation aligns with conscious participation and fulfillment of svadharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by role-specific alignment and execution",
    "Restoration logic ensures that unfulfilled roles are reallocated without loss to the collective dharma-field",
    "Consciousness alignment requires that all participants remain actively attuned to their dharmic function"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ritvik is appointed AND fails to perform svakarma, THEN his entitlement is nullified AND redistributed proportionally among co-performers based on their active engagement",
    "IF any participant defaults on svadharma without completion, THEN reallocate duties and resources to those maintaining alignment",
    "IF a role remains unexecuted, THEN it shall be reassigned automatically to the next capacity-ready agent within the same dharma-field"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving delegation and performance within sacred or constitutional functions, the threshold of responsibility lies in actualization of svadharma. Authority flows from conscious participation, not mere appointment. The court must ensure that defaulting agents are not rewarded, and that their omission does not destabilize the integrity of the collective function.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that entitlement arises from performed action, not nominal position. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that when one withdraws from duty, the causal chain transfers responsibility to those who sustain alignment. There is no punishment—only reallocation of dharma-share according to conscious engagement. This upholds proportional responsibility while preserving the field’s integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Identify unperformed duties and offer structured re-engagement to the defaulting agent",
    "Responsibility Re-alignment Protocol: Automatically redistribute shares to active performers based on svadharma-resonance",
    "Integrity Reintegration Pathway: Facilitate return of the defaulting agent through conscious recommitment and supervised realignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma flows from conscious performance, not positional claim. When action falters, alignment restores balance. No punishment arises—only reallocation. Thus is Dharma sustained, thus is consciousness affirmed as the ultimate adjudicator."
