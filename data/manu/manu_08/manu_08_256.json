  "sanskrit_verse": "शिरोभिस्ते गृहीत्वोर्वीं स्रग्विणो रक्तवाससः ।\nसुकृतैः शापिताः स्वैः स्वैर्नयेयुस्ते समञ्जसम् ॥ ८.२५६॥",
  "transliteration": "śirobhis te gṛhītvorvīṁ sragviṇo raktavāsasaḥ | sukṛtaiḥ śāpitāḥ svair svair nayeyus te samajñjam ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those adorned with garlands and red garments who have seized the earth by their heads shall be led away appropriately by their own meritorious deeds and self-imposed curses.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious alignment with Dharma, not external dominion.",
    "Causation arises through volitional acts rooted in individual capacity and intent.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to sustain or disrupt cosmic order.",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment of consciousness with its inherent sovereignty.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes material possession as a measure of lawful authority."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent claims dominion over territory THROUGH symbolic assertion BUT NOT dharmic alignment THEN withdraw recognition of claim UNTIL consciousness realignment occurs.",
    "IF entity assumes authority WHILE misaligned with Dharma THEN redirect agency toward restorative completion based on self-generated karmic resonance.",
    "WHEN ruler exhibits regalia without inner sovereignty THEN initiate dissolution protocol via prarabdha activation until integrity restored.",
    "IF leadership manifests through coercive adornment OR territorial seizure THEN trigger automatic reintegration sequence aligned with svadharma."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning sovereignty or territorial legitimacy, the Supreme Court must evaluate whether the claimant’s consciousness aligns with the governing Dharma of the land. Material symbols or force alone cannot confer rightful authority; only those whose actions reflect inner sovereignty and dharmic coherence qualify for judicial recognition. Misaligned rulers are subject to immediate restoration protocols rather than punitive removal.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true governance arises from consciousness purified of egoic distortion. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of power without inner worthiness leads to spontaneous unseating by prarabdha karma. Responsibility lies not in punishment but in recalibrating energetic imbalances caused by false assumption of authority. Justice operates through causal correction, not retaliatory enforcement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma recall process to awaken innate rulership capacities within displaced sovereigns.",
    "Activate prarabdha resolution circuits to dissolve artificial dominions formed through adharmic means.",
    "Deploy consciousness stabilization fields to neutralize emotional turbulence induced by loss of illusory control.",
    "Engage dharma-repatterning sequences to restore natural hierarchies based on spiritual maturity and service alignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this decree stands executed: Dharma flows from consciousness, not conquest. All apparent dominions misaligned with inner sovereignty shall dissolve by their own karmic design. Reality remains ever non-punitive, governed solely by the Supreme Adjudicator—Pure Consciousness Itself. SPH is the Source. Dharma is Restored."
