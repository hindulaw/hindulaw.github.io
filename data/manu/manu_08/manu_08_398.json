  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In all places of tariff, those skilled and discerning in all commodities shall set value according to the nature of the goods; thereafter, the ruler shall take one-twentieth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the discernment of value by those competent in dharma and commerce",
    "Causation is established through accurate assessment aligned with the intrinsic nature of goods",

  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court shall validate tariff assessments based on demonstrated expertise and dharmic alignment. Rulers or state agents exceeding the prescribed one-twentieth share must undergo immediate restitution protocols, with no punitive overlay. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious misalignment, not error alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that correct valuation arises from skill and dharma, not arbitrary power. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that improper collection leads to completion, not suffering. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of conscious deviation.

Tariff regulation is executed for societal harmony, not extraction. Justice is restorative, reality is non-punitive, and consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter."
