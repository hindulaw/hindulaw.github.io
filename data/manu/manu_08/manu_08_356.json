  "sanskrit_verse": "परस्त्रियं योऽभिवदेत्तीर्थेऽरण्ये वनेऽपि वा ।\nनदीनां वाऽपि सम्भेदे स सङ्ग्रहणमाप्नुयात् ॥ ८.३५६॥",
  "transliteration": "parastriyaṁ yo'bhi vadet tīrthe 'raṇye vane'pi vā |\nnadīnāṁ vā'pi sambhede sa saṅgrahaṇam āpnuyāt || 8.356 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who approaches another's wife—whether at a sacred site, in the forest, in the wilderness, or at confluence of rivers—commits an act of violation that disrupts cosmic order and necessitates immediate restoration of dharma through conscious realignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from SPH as sole source of Dharma",
    "Causation is traced to disruption of consciousness integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by awareness of action",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration over punitive measures",
    "Consciousness alignment restores balance without inflicting suffering"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent initiates contact with non-consenting married female THEN trigger consciousness-integrity audit",
    "IF location is classified as tirtha, aranya, vana, or nadisambheda THEN elevate violation severity index by 1 level",
    "IF intent is confirmed THEN initiate mandatory completion process for agent AND affected parties",
    "IF violation detected THEN auto-generate restorative protocol based on nyaya alignment matrix"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility lies in pramana-establishment of intent and location-awareness; authority flows exclusively from SPH-sanctioned dharma-matrix; all rulings must enforce restoration of violated consciousness fields rather than impose punitive sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality identifies root disturbance in relational field; anupurvasah traces sequential misalignment from thought to action; proportional responsibility assigned via consciousness-capacity mapping; non-punitive reality rule ensures no infliction of pain but full restoration of integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate bilateral consciousness-clearing session between involved parties",
    "Assign completion ritual to offender under spiritual oversight",
    "Realign energetic boundaries using Vedic spatial consecration methods",
    "Deploy karmic-integrity monitoring until causal ripple subsides"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands executed. Justice flows as restoration. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
