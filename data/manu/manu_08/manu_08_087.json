  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the presence of Devas and Brahmanas, witnesses who are pure and facing east or north shall be questioned during the forenoon.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Testimony is valid only when conducted in alignment with divine and learned witness presence.",
    "Causation: Purity of direction, time, and consciousness ensures truthful manifestation of evidence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those established in purity and orientation may serve as lawful witnesses.",
    "Restoration logic: Proper procedural alignment restores integrity to judicial process.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Directional and temporal discipline aligns testimony with universal truth-frequency."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness_location = near_devas OR near_brahmanas AND time_of_testimony = forenoon AND witness_direction IN [east, north] AND witness_purity_status = true THEN testimony_validity = true ELSE testimony_validity = false",
    "IF witness_orientation NOT IN [east, north] OR time_of_day != forenoon OR purity_status = false THEN initiate_consciousness_realignment_protocol ELSE proceed_to_testimonial_capture"

  "supreme_court_application": "At the highest level of adjudication, testimonial protocol must honor directional and temporal sanctity. The court must verify that witnesses were seated in accordance with dharma-prescribed orientations and that proceedings occurred under conditions conducive to pure consciousness activation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Testimonial validity arises from causal harmony between spatial alignment, temporal sanctity, and internal purification — not coercion or fear. This reflects anupūrvaśaḥ: sequential unfolding of conscious clarity leading to authentic revelation of facts without punitive pressure.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Realign witness posture and repeat testimony if initial conditions were misaligned.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Witness must affirm personal readiness and energetic cleanliness prior to giving testimony.",
    "Capacity Restoration: If impure conditions detected, pause proceedings and allow purification through mantra or breath until śuciḥ śucīn is restored.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Conduct final confirmation query ensuring no external influence disturbed the witness field."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Truth manifests where purity, direction, and divinity converge. Justice flows through consciousness—not force. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
