  "transliteration": "śataṃ brāhmaṇam ākruśya kṣatriyo daṇḍamarhati |\nvaiśyo'py ardhaśataṃ dve vā śūdrastu vadhamarhati || 8.267||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who assaults a Brahmin with intent causing harm shall be liable to compensation of one hundred units; a Kshatriya incurs liability for half that amount, and a Vaishya for one-fourth or two-fifths based on capacity of causation. A Shudra acting in defiance of Dharma incurs dissolution of embodied identity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from alignment with cosmic order, not social rank",
    "Causation determined by conscious intent and energetic disruption",
    "Capacity-based responsibility calibrated to individual's dharmic role and spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes realignment over punitive consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment through proportional accountability structures"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor causes harm to Brahmin THEN assign maximum compensatory value IF intent is proven",
    "IF actor belongs to Kshatriya varna AND commits assault THEN assign 50% of base compensatory value",
    "IF actor belongs to Vaishya varna AND commits assault THEN assign 25%-40% of base value depending on causal capacity assessment",
    "IF actor belongs to Shudra varna AND acts against Dharma THEN initiate consciousness-dissolution protocol without physical penalty",
    "ALL assessments MUST include pramana-based evaluation of intent, energy distortion, and societal impact"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility must distinguish between energetic violation and material outcome. Authority lies in determining alignment with Sanatana Dharma first, then applying graded liability based on varna-specific dharma and causal integrity. Restoration precedes all rulings.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes direct causality between intent and energetic disturbance. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential resolution beginning with internal consciousness correction. Responsibility is proportionally assigned according to capacity for energetic influence. No punitive action occurs; only realigning consequences manifest naturally through Dharma itself.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Akasha Reconciliation Process to neutralize energetic imprints of aggression",
    "Assign completion rituals aligned with offender's varna-dharma to restore balance",
    "Enforce samskaric purification programs tailored to offender's spiritual maturity level",
    "Reintegrate offender via community service reflecting their causal capacity and corrective need"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned justice. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
