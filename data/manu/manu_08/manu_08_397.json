  "transliteration": "tantuvāyo daśapalaṃ dadyādekpalādhikam | ato'nyathā vartamāno dāpyo dvādaśakaṃ damam || 8.397 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The weaver shall give ten palas of thread and one additional pala; if he acts otherwise, he shall be liable to a penalty of twelvefold restitution.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from adherence to contractual capacity and role-specific dharma",
    "Causation arises through deviation from established exchange protocols",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by operational integrity within vocational alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through proportional completion rather than punitive extraction",
    "Consciousness alignment requires rectification of transactional distortions without inflicting suffering"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor deviates from specified contractual delivery THEN initiate twelvefold restitution protocol",
    "IF vocational role = weaver AND transaction ≠ (10 + 1) palas THEN trigger automatic compliance restoration loop",
    "IF restitution initiated THEN assign corrective fulfillment sequence until energetic balance restored",
    "IF deviation recorded THEN log consciousness misalignment flag for systemic pattern audit"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating commercial or artisanal disputes involving contractual obligations, the Supreme Court must assess not intent nor negligence but precise alignment with role-determined capacity. Penalties are not punitive but functionally restorative, recalibrating energetic and material imbalances caused by deviation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misalignment in exchange generates sequential distortion in economic dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as loss of trust, value fluctuation, and systemic imbalance. Responsibility is calibrated not to induce pain but to restore functional harmony through proportionate completion. The offender assumes the causal burden until equilibrium is re-established.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Require delivery of accurate measurement (10+1 palas) plus symbolic surplus",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Engage artisan in supervised community weaving service until balance restored",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide access to tools and resources needed to fulfill corrected obligation",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Conduct public acknowledgment and reaffirmation of vocational dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed—not as judgment but as restoration. Dharma flows from consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. All beings are sovereign expressions of the same Divine Will, guided toward alignment through clarity, not suffering."
