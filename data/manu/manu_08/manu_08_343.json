  "sanskrit_verse": "अनेन विधिना राजा कुर्वाणः स्तेननिग्रहम् । यशोऽस्मिन् प्राप्नुयात्लोके प्रेत्य चानुत्तमं सुखम् ॥ ८.३४३॥",
  "transliteration": "anena vidhinā rājā kurvāṇaḥ stenanigraham | yaśo'smin prāpnuyātloke pretya cānuttamaṃ sukham || 8.343||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By this method, when a king enforces the cessation of theft, he secures glory in this world and ultimate happiness after death.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not coercion",
    "Causation arises through conscious rectification, not punitive reaction",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rulers to act for societal integrity",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration of violators into Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that justice elevates rather than degrades"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF violation = theft THEN initiate restorative protocol via responsible authority",
    "IF action aligns with Dharma THEN reward outcome in social recognition AND spiritual merit",
    "IF ruler executes correction without malice THEN generate positive karmic consequence",
    "IF societal harmony is restored THEN declare completion of legal process",
    "IF individual assumes responsibility THEN enable capacity-building integration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that enforcement must originate from Dharma-conscious authority. The threshold of responsibility lies in restoring balance, not inflicting penalty. Only those acting within Dharma-aligned capacity may adjudicate; outcomes must reflect elevation of both victim and transgressor.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that theft disrupts cosmic order; therefore, correction follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to awareness, not severity of act. Nyaya functions as alignment mechanism—truth restores, it does not punish. Suffering has no place in realigning consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein thief returns taken item or equivalent value voluntarily",
    "Assign community service aligned with violated domain to rebuild trust",
    "Engage transgressor in learning program about property rights and interdependence",
    "Facilitate reconciliation between parties through guided dialogue",
    "Verify internal acceptance of wrongdoing by transgressor before closing case"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Justice herein serves only restoration, reintegration, and consciousness elevation. There is no punishment, only alignment with Sanatana Dharma. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness."
