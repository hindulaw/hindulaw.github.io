  "transliteration": "ādhiś copanidhiś cobhau na kālātyayamarhataḥ |\navahāryau bhavetāṃ tau dīrghakālam avasthitau || 8.145||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Both a loan and a deposit must not be allowed to perish through the passage of time; they remain recoverable even after long duration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the preservation of contractual integrity",
    "Causation is sustained through conscious acknowledgment of obligation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends beyond temporal limitation",
    "Restoration logic upholds continuity of economic dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring commitments across durations"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a financial obligation is acknowledged AND no formal discharge occurs THEN enforceability persists regardless of elapsed time",
    "IF a deposit or debt record exists IN any verifiable form THEN retrieval protocol MUST activate upon claim initiation",
    "IF temporal delay invoked as defense THEN rebuttal SHALL be automatic based on original transaction consciousness",
    "IF capacity for repayment remains THEN assumption of responsibility SHALL be realigned without punitive framing"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that mere passage of time cannot nullify legally recognized obligations. The threshold of responsibility lies in the initial conscious acceptance of the loan or deposit. Authority hierarchies must ensure restoration of rightful ownership or repayment, irrespective of procedural delays.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that the act of lending or depositing creates an enduring causal link between parties. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that consequences unfold according to inherent dharma, not arbitrary timelines. Proportional responsibility aligns with the original intent and capacity retained. Non-punitive reality rule holds that enforcement serves reintegration, not penalty.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through recognition of enduring obligation. Reality reflects non-punitivity, and consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
