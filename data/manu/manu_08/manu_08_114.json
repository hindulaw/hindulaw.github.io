  "sanskrit_verse": "अग्निं वाऽहारयेदेनमप्सु चैनं निमज्जयेत् ।\nपुत्रदारस्य वाप्येनं शिरांसि स्पर्शयेत्पृथक् ॥ ८.११४॥",
  "transliteration": "agniṃ vā'harayed enam apsu cainaṃ nimajjayet |\nputradārasya vāpyenaṃ śirāṃsi sparśayet pṛthak || 8.114||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has committed grave misconduct may undergo the trial by fire, submersion in water, or separation from son and wife, each method revealing truth through direct experiential consequence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in experiential consequence, not punitive decree",
    "Causation aligns with conscious distortion created by action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from volitional distortion",
    "Restoration logic operates through self-corrective experience",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when distortion is directly resolved"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent commits violation THEN assign consequence aligned with distortion type",
    "IF agent undergoes elemental trial THEN record experiential outcome as evidence",
    "IF relational integrity breached THEN initiate separation protocol until realignment",
    "IF consciousness distortion detected THEN apply self-corrective mechanism",
    "IF completion achieved THEN restore relational and societal integration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudicates based on capacity-consciousness correlation; trials by element or relation reflect ontological accountability, bypassing punitive frameworks for direct karmic resolution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa lies in direct consequence, not imposed penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential alignment with original distortion. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at time of act. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering as misalignment, not justice.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Elemental Consequence Protocol: Assign trial by fire/water to reveal inner state",
    "Relational Separation Protocol: Temporarily sever key bonds to allow recalibration",
    "Completion Process: Confirm full experiential understanding before reintegration",
    "Integrity Reintegration Protocol: Restore social position upon verified alignment",
    "Awareness Restoration Cycle: Reinforce causal link between action and experience"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Truth revealed through elemental and relational consequence restores balance without punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate judge, and reality itself enforces alignment."
