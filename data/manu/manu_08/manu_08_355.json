  "transliteration": "yas tv anākṣāritaḥ pūrvam abhibhāṣeta kāraṇāt |\nna doṣaṃ prāpnuyāt kiñcin na hi tasya vyatikramaḥ || 8.355||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who speaks without prior instruction, out of personal motive, incurs no fault thereby, for there is no transgression where capacity has not been formally invoked.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from formal invocation, not spontaneous action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires explicit alignment with dharma-role",
    "Causation is determined by structural position, not intent alone",
    "Restoration logic begins when misaligned speech is realigned to its source",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of one's uninvoked state"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent speaks without prior authorized assignment AND motivation is self-originated THEN no liability is incurred",
    "IF capacity has not been formally conferred THEN actions are non-binding in dharmic law",
    "IF speech originates outside assigned structure THEN it shall be redirected to restoration protocol, not penalty",
    "IF no violation of formal duty exists THEN no punitive consequence applies"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes that only those acting under formal dharma-capacity can incur juridical fault. Spontaneous or unauthorized speech, even if misguided, does not invoke punishment but redirection toward lawful structure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality locates fault only where formal capacity intersects with violation. Since no such intersection occurred here, there is no basis for punitive response. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) shows absence of lawful transgression. Responsibility remains proportional to structural role. Thus, reality enforces alignment, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Redirect speaker to acknowledge uninvoked status and align with proper channels",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Encourage voluntary reintegration into structured discourse",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide access to authorized speaking roles if needed",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Confirm alignment with truth-consciousness over self-motivation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Fault arises only from misuse of conferred capacity. Consciousness, not punishment, governs all realignment. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
