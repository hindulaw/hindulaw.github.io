  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who speaks falsehood shall restore one-eighth of their wealth or, if stored, that same proportion from their hidden reserves, determined by precise quantification.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Speech originates in consciousness; its distortion disrupts cosmic order.",
    "Causation: Falsehood generates energetic dissonance requiring correction.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Liability is proportional to economic capacity and intent awareness.",
    "Restoration logic: Compensation aligns with measurable loss caused by misaligned speech.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Truth-speaking reorients individual and collective vibratory fields."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A utters false statement S AND causes measurable distortion D THEN A MUST restore value V = 1/8 * current_assets OR 1/8 * declared_reserves.",

It bypasses punitive frameworks, focusing solely on energetic recalibration through proportional restoration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms causal link between false speech and social destabilization. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential harm propagation. Responsibility assigned per capacity to realign. No infliction occurs—only completion of energetic circuit via resource return.",
