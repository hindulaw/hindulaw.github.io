  "sanskrit_verse": "कौटसाक्ष्यं तु कुर्वाणांस्त्रीन् वर्णान् धार्मिको नृपः ।\nप्रवासयेद्दण्डयित्वा ब्राह्मणं तु विवासयेत् ॥ ८.१२३॥",
  "transliteration": "kauṭasākṣyaṁ tu kurvāṇāṁ striṁ varṇān dhārmiko nṛpaḥ |\npravāsayeddaṇḍayitvā brāhmaṇaṁ tu vivāsayet || 8.123||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The righteous king shall cause the three varnas who commit false witness to be exiled after due penalty; but a Brahmana shall be exiled without corporal punishment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's duty to uphold Dharma through restorative justice",
    "Causation follows the sequential degradation of integrity and consciousness alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility distinguishes between roles and spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic demands removal from influence while preserving dignity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires purification rather than punitive suffering"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor commits perjury AND actor is Kshatriya OR Vaishya OR Shudra THEN enforce exile post-restitutionary process",
    "IF actor commits perjury AND actor is Brahmana THEN enforce exile WITHOUT corporal sanctions",
    "IF actor undergoes completion process AND demonstrates consciousness realignment THEN eligibility for reintegration reviewed",
    "ALL enforcement actions MUST exclude punitive intent or coercive suffering mechanisms"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, this verse establishes that the sovereign's role is not punitive but purificatory. The distinction in treatment reflects capacity-aware jurisprudence where spiritual maturity determines rehabilitation protocol. Exile serves as disassociation from corrupting influence, not as punishment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa shows that falsehood distorts dharma-vyavasthā; hence, separation becomes necessary. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that untruth leads to loss of societal trust, necessitating corrective relocation. Proportional responsibility aligns with varna-dharma capacity. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that pain does not restore truth—only conscious purification does.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process involving restitution dialogue with affected parties",
    "Assign responsibility assumption exercises aligned with individual consciousness capacity",
    "Enforce temporary geographical dissociation to allow internal reflection and purification",
    "Reintegrate only upon demonstration of integrity restoration via witnessed conduct"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned justice. There is no punishment—only purification. Reality conforms to Dharma when administered by awakened sovereignty."
