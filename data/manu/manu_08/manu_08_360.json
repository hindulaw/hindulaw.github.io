  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who have taken vows of renunciation—such as mendicants, captives, initiates, and servants—are permitted to engage in conversation with women when not explicitly restricted by their governing authority.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by the structural role within societal order, not personal intent.",
    "Causation arises through relational capacity, not abstract moral frameworks.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies according to one's functional integration within dharma.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes alignment with existing dharmic roles over punitive correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of lawful positioning, not external judgment."

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, this verse establishes a threshold of authority that supersedes individual discretion. The court must verify whether a governing body has issued explicit directives restricting interaction; absence of such directive confirms lawful engagement. Responsibility lies in maintaining structural integrity rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality affirms that conduct is lawful where no authoritative restriction exists. Anupūrvaśaḥ reflects sequential unfolding of relational duties based on role, not punitive consequence.
