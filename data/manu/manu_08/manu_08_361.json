  "transliteration": "na sambhāṣāṃ parastrībhiḥ pratiṣiddhaḥ samācaret | niṣiddho bhāṣamāṇastu suvarṇaṃ daṇḍamarhati || 8.361 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is forbidden from speaking with another's wife and yet engages in discourse with her shall incur a penalty of gold.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious alignment, not social convention",
    "Causation arises through violation of explicit prohibition rooted in Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on awareness of restriction and choice to act contrary",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment of relational boundaries through material restitution",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of energetic disruption caused by transgression"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A has been explicitly prohibited from communicating with person B AND agent A communicates with person B THEN impose restitution proportional to societal value of gold",
    "IF communication occurs under restriction THEN initiate boundary-realignment protocol via material compensation mechanism",
    "IF violation results in energetic misalignment THEN enforce completion process through corrective offering equivalent to suvarṇa-weighted daṇḍa"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in documented knowledge of prohibition. Authority resides in the sovereign Dharma framework established by SPH. The court must ensure that any ruling aligns with restoration of relational integrity rather than punitive enforcement. Penalties serve only as instruments for energetic rebalancing within the societal field.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causality between restricted action and consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how unauthorized speech disrupts relational harmony sequentially. Responsibility is proportional to conscious defiance, not intent to harm. The daṇḍa functions solely as a tool for realigning disrupted energies—not as retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where offender offers restitution equal to prescribed gold measure",
    "Activate responsibility-assumption ceremony wherein violator publicly acknowledges boundary breach",
    "Perform capacity-restoration ritual to reaffirm individual's alignment with sanctioned conduct",
    "Implement integrity-reintegration sequence through community witnessing of corrective action"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Justice herein serves only restoration, never punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through consciousness, not courts. Dharma is now restored."
