  "transliteration": "tat-samuttho hi lokasya jāyate varṇa-saṅkaraḥ |\nyena mūla-haro 'dharmaḥ sarva-nāśāya kalpate || 8.353||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From that arising, indeed, occurs the mingling of castes among people; by which the fundamental duty is lost, leading to total destruction.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the preservation of foundational dharmic order",
    "Causation follows sequential degradation when foundational duties are neglected",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from alignment with one's svadharma",
    "Restoration logic requires reestablishment of pure causal foundations",
    "Consciousness alignment prevents societal entropy through caste-mixing"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a social action results in varṇa-saṅkara THEN halt propagation and initiate restoration of svadharma boundaries",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any case involving inter-caste unions or erosion of traditional roles must invoke threshold analysis: whether foundational dharma has been compromised. If so, the court shall not apply punitive measures but direct restorative interventions aimed at realigning consciousness and reestablishing dharmic structure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that varṇa-saṅkara disrupts cosmic秩序 rooted in svadharma. This disruption manifests sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ), culminating in adharma that uproots societal stability. Responsibility lies not in blame but in correction—aligning consciousness back to its source. Thus, justice is executed through restoration, not retaliation.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Law: Dharma is restored through conscious realignment, not punishment. The mingling of castes dissolves when consciousness returns to its pure origin. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
