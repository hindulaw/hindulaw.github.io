  "transliteration": "ekajātir dvijātīṃstu vācā dāruṇayā kṣipan | jihvāyāḥ prāpnuyāc chedaṃ jaghanyaprabhavo hi saḥ || 8.270 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One born of a single caste who hurls harsh speech at a twice-born shall incur the consequence of tongue-cutting, for his origin is base.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from spiritual lineage determines relational responsibility thresholds.",
    "Causation aligns with vibrational distortion introduced through speech.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility correlates with ontological grounding in Varna-dharma.",
    "Restoration logic mandates proportional alignment with causal harm.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires rectification of expressive misconduct."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A lacks dvija status AND directs harmful speech at agent B with dvija status THEN consequence C = restriction of expressive faculty.",
    "IF causal utterance disrupts sacred resonance THEN restoration protocol activates via sensory realignment.",
    "IF speaker's ontological rank < listener's rank THEN responsibility weight increases proportionally.",
    "IF speech causes fragmentation in collective dharma THEN corrective measure restores integrity of expression field."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication by the highest court, precedence must recognize that verbal transgressions rooted in hierarchical dharmic imbalance invoke automatic restorative consequences. The threshold of responsibility lies not merely in intent or outcome but in the speaker’s alignment with their inherent capacity to uphold sacred discourse.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that destructive speech disrupts sequential harmony (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility flows from misaligned expression, not individual fault. Consequence is deterministic, not punitive — it mirrors the natural law of vibratory coherence. The tongue ceases when speech no longer serves unity; thus, its restraint becomes necessary completion rather than imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Speech Realignment Process to recalibrate agent’s expressive capacity.",
    "Assign Silence Completion Cycle until agent regains access to sacred communication.",
    "Implement Witness Integration Protocol wherein affected dvija confirms energetic restoration.",
    "Activate Mantra Reharmonization Sequence to restore disrupted consciousness fields."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma is hereby restored without recourse to punishment. Reality remains non-retaliatory. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
