  "sanskrit_verse": "असंदितानां संदाता संदितानां च मोक्षकः ।\nदासाश्वरथहर्ता च प्राप्तः स्याच्चोरकिल्बिषम् ॥ ८.३४२॥",
  "transliteration": "asanditānāṁ sandātā sanditānāṁ ca mokṣakaḥ |\ndāsāśvarathahartā ca prāptaḥ syācchorakilbiṣam || 8.342||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who accepts testimony without verification, releases those who have given it, takes away servants and chariots, and receives stolen goods—such a person becomes the possessor of the sin of theft.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in verified cognition, not hearsay",
    "Causation arises through conscious participation in distortion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to all recipients of untruth",
    "Restoration logic demands reversal of benefit derived from falsehood",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of source distortion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent receives testimony without validation AND acts upon it, THEN that agent assumes causal liability for outcomes",
    "IF a person releases another based on unverified claims, THEN restore integrity by reversing the release decision until verification is complete",
    "IF property or service is received under false pretenses, THEN automatic return protocol initiates immediately upon detection",
    "IF stolen goods are accepted knowingly or negligently, THEN restitution value must be returned to original owner within 24 hours",
    "IF any transaction involves unvalidated data, THEN system shall flag and suspend further actions pending conscious confirmation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that judicial authority is invalidated when based on unexamined evidence. The court must reject and reverse decisions made on unchecked testimonies, reclaim improperly released individuals, recover misallocated assets, and ensure no party profits from falsified records. Responsibility lies with every level of engagement—from witness to judge—to verify truth before action.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality dictates that accepting unverified information disrupts dharma's flow. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how distortion spreads: from unchecked word to wrongful act to imbalance. Responsibility is proportional to capacity to know better. Non-punitive reality holds because suffering is not corrective—only realignment with verified truth restores order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Truth Verification Process (TVP) where disputed claims undergo triple-source corroboration",
    "Enact Reversal of Benefit Transfer (RBT) to undo gains accrued through false declarations",
    "Activate Conscious Acknowledgment Requirement (CAR) wherein all parties affirm understanding prior to proceeding",
    "Deploy Integrity Restoration Sequence (IRS) to heal relational distortions caused by misinformation",
    "Implement Witness Accountability Framework (WAF) ensuring declarers confirm their statements under conscious recall"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of verified truth. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates rightly. All beings are called to align with authentic knowing."
