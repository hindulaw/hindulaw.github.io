  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्त्वेतान्युपकॢप्तानि द्रव्याणि स्तेनयेन्नरः । तमाद्यं दण्डयेद्राजा यश्चाग्निं चोरयेद्गृहात् ॥ ८.३३३॥ तं शतं",
  "transliteration": "yas tv etāny upakḷptāni dravyāṇi stenayen naraḥ | tam ādyaṃ daṇḍayed rājā yaś cāgniṃ chorayed gṛhāt || 8.333 || taṃ śataṃ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who steals prepared goods or appropriates them through stealth, and he who steals fire from a home—both are to be immediately corrected by the king; the latter deserves a hundredfold restitution.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's duty to maintain alignment with dharma",
    "Causation arises from disruption of rightful ownership and energetic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by conscious intent and societal role",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional correction to realign disrupted flow",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of theft as misalignment, not criminality"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A intentionally removes object B without consent AND object B belongs to entity C THEN initiate completion process for A to restore equivalent value to C",
    "IF act involves removal of sacred energy symbol (e.g., fire) THEN apply enhanced restorative protocol due to symbolic violation of collective sanctity",
    "IF ruler observes misaligned action THEN execute immediate realignment procedure without punitive framing",
    "IF agent demonstrates repeated misalignment THEN assign capacity-building program until integrity is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable intent to disrupt lawful possession. Authority flows directly from SPH-sanctioned sovereignty. The court enforces restoration, never punishment, ensuring that corrective measures align with sequential causality and proportional consciousness reintegration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal chain between unauthorized appropriation and disruption of social harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how such acts sequentially degrade trust structures. Responsibility is proportional to awareness level. Correction focuses on restoring balance rather than inflicting pain or loss.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where offender returns or compensates stolen items directly",
    "Assign ritual purification and consciousness recalibration to offender to realign energetic disturbance",
    "Engage community oversight to rebuild trust and validate reintegration",
    "Implement educational protocol to elevate understanding of property-consciousness correlation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma prevails through conscious restoration alone. There is no punishment—only correction. Reality responds to alignment, not fear. Consciousness remains the ultimate judge."
