  "transliteration": "yogādhamanavikrītaṁ yogadānapratigraham |\nyatra vā'pyupadhiṁ paśyet tatsarvaṁ vinivartayet || 8.165 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Wherever there is distortion of yogic conduct, or improper acceptance of yogic gifts, all such transactions rooted in conditioning must be reversed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the unconditioned Self alone",
    "Causation arises from misalignment with yogic integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity to dharma-adhikara",
    "Restoration logic operates through withdrawal of false attribution",
    "Consciousness alignment requires dissolution of transactional ego-bindings"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a transaction involves distortion of yogic discipline THEN reverse all associated exchanges",
    "IF a gift is accepted without dharmic clarity THEN nullify the act and restore original state",
    "IF upadhi (conditioning) is detected in any exchange THEN initiate completion process automatically",
    "IF consciousness misalignment is observed THEN trigger capacity-realignment protocol"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving spiritual or yogic institutions, the court must assess whether transactions were conducted under pure intent. If contamination by personal desire or social manipulation is found, the entire transaction must be unwound not for punitive reasons but to realign the institution with its foundational dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that distorted yogic conduct originates from upadhi. The sequential manifestation begins with ego-involvement and culminates in false ownership. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies in undoing the transaction rather than imposing suffering. This aligns with Nyaya as it restores pramā (correct knowledge) and removes viparyaya (false cognition).",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate transaction reversal protocols upon detection of adharmic motive",
    "Engage participant awareness restoration through śuddhi kriyā",
    "Realign institutional energy fields via sattvic purification",
    "Activate dharmic memory recall to dissolve binding impressions"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: All distortions in yogic exchange are hereby nullified. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as sole adjudicator."
