  "transliteration": "pāṇigrahaṇikā mantra niyataṁ dāralakṣaṇam |\nteṣāṁ niṣṭhā tu vijñeyā vidvadbhiḥ saptame padae || 8.227||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The mantras recited during the act of holding hands are deterministically indicative of conjugal union; their steadfast adherence is to be known by the learned in the seventh stage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in conscious alignment with ritualized intent",
    "Causation flows through consecrated ceremonial acts",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic operates via completion of sacramental sequence",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through disciplined repetition"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF conjugal status is disputed THEN verify presence and accuracy of pāṇigrahaṇa mantras",
    "IF mantra omission detected THEN initiate guided re-enactment protocol under qualified supervision",
    "IF deliberate deviation observed THEN assess actor's capacity through saptama pada alignment metrics",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that marital validity hinges upon precise execution of foundational rites. The threshold of responsibility lies not in punitive fault assignment but in verifying whether the actors have accessed the requisite level of awareness (sapta pada). Authority derives from alignment with the consecrated form, not personal interpretation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that the utterance of specific mantras at the time of hand-holding creates a binding energetic configuration. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential unfolding: physical gesture → verbal invocation → metaphysical union. Responsibility is proportional to one’s access to sapta pada—spiritual insight—not external coercion. This framework upholds reality as non-punitive because misalignment triggers correction, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform仪式with correct mantra under supervision",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge role in disruption without shame",
    "Capacity Restoration: Initiate study and practice toward saptama pada realization",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public reaffirmation of mutual commitment post-correction"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through conscious alignment with sacred ritual form. There is no punishment where completion restores integrity. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
