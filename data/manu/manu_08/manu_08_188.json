  "sanskrit_verse": "निक्षेपेष्वेषु सर्वेषु विधिः स्यात्परिसाधने ।\nसमुद्रे नाप्नुयात्किं चिद्यदि तस्मान्न संहरेत् ॥ ८.१८८॥",
  "transliteration": "nikṣepeṣu eṣu sarveṣu vidhiḥ syāt parisādhane |\nsamudre nāpnuyāt kiṃ cid yadi tasmān na saṃharet || 8.188||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In all such deposits, the procedural law shall be for completion and retrieval; if nothing is acquired from the ocean, then nothing shall be reclaimed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from the act of conscious deposit and acknowledgment",
    "Causation follows the integrity of the depositor's intent and capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in the ability to reclaim or release",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion, not possession",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of claim or abandonment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a deposit is made with full consciousness AND acknowledged by a competent witness, THEN the right to retrieval is absolute.",
    "IF no acquisition occurs from an unclaimed domain such as the ocean, THEN no entity holds reclamation rights.",
    "IF a deposit lacks conscious intent OR witness validation, THEN it defaults to non-retrievable status.",
    "ALL claims must pass a pramāṇa-based verification of original deposit integrity before adjudication.",
    "NO punitive measure shall arise from failed retrieval; restoration is solely through capacity alignment."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that claims of ownership or retrieval must be evaluated based on the depositor's conscious intent and verifiable action. Where no measurable gain or traceable deposit exists—as in taking from the open ocean—no legal basis for restitution arises. The court must affirm the primacy of witnessed intent and reject speculative or punitive claims.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through conscious deposit and witness confirmation. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that only what is intentionally placed and acknowledged can be lawfully retrieved. Responsibility aligns with the depositor’s capacity to maintain integrity. No punitive consequence arises from failure to reclaim; dharma is restored through recognition of original causality.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate witness-led verification of original deposit integrity",
    "Engage consciousness-alignment process for the depositor to reaffirm or release claim",
    "Deploy completion protocols to close unresolved deposit-retrieval cycles",
    "Reintegrate depositor’s capacity through dharmic education and energetic clearing",
    "Nullify all punitive or coercive measures related to retrieval failure"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through alignment with conscious deposit and completion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness remains the sole adjudicator."
