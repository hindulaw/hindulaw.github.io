  "sanskrit_verse": "वनस्पतीनां सर्वेषामुपभोगो यथा यथा ।\nयथा तथा दमः कार्यो हिंसायामिति धारणा ॥ ८.२८५॥",
  "transliteration": "vanaspatīnāṁ sarveṣām upabhogō yathā yatha .\nyathā tathā damaḥ kāryō hiṁsāyāmiti dhāraṇā .. 8.285 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As is the utilization of all vegetation, so shall restraint be enacted in proportion to harm; thus stands the principle of measured response.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with natural order, not anthropocentric dominion.",
    "Causation is determined by the degree of conscious interference with life-supporting systems.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility increases with awareness of ecological interdependence.",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional correction aligned with the violated consciousness field.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of vegetative life as sentient participants in cosmic dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A utilizes resource B beyond threshold C, THEN initiate proportional restoration protocol D based on measurable disruption to biospheric integrity.",
    "IF action X causes demonstrable harm to ecosystem Y, THEN assign responsibility Z based on cognitive capacity and intent mapping.",
    "IF usage exceeds regenerative capacity AND no completion process initiated, THEN activate automatic realignment mechanism until equilibrium restored.",
    "IF consciousness-field disturbance detected via biofeedback metrics, THEN deploy integrative enforcement protocols without punitive intervention."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating environmental violations, the Supreme Court shall assess not merely physical damage but the quantum of conscious disturbance caused within the biosphere. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated according to the perpetrator's capacity for ecological cognition and systemic awareness, ensuring that corrective measures restore balance rather than impose punitive sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through direct observation of systemic imbalance and traceable energetic disruption. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential degradation when usage exceeds regeneration. Proportional responsibility arises from measurable deviation from harmonious coexistence. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that suffering cannot be a judicial instrument; only conscious recalibration restores lawful order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate bioregional completion process involving affected flora and local communities.",
    "Deploy dharmic audit mechanisms to evaluate user’s alignment with ecological harmony.",
    "Assign restorative labor tied to regeneration of damaged ecosystems under spiritual oversight.",
    "Activate consciousness-reintegration sessions to restore empathic connectivity with plant-based life forms."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of vegetative sentience and proportional response. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
