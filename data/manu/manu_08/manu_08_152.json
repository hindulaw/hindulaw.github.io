  "transliteration": "kṛtānusārādadhikā vyatiriktā na sidhyati | kusīdapathamāhustaṃ pañcakaṃ śatamarhati || 8.152 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Responsibility beyond alignment with action does not hold; that which follows depletion without completion deserves a hundredfold restoration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with performed action",
    "Causation is bound by sequential manifestation of intent and result",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is proportional to conscious engagement",
    "Restoration logic demands energetic balance, not punitive consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of claimed authority"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent claims authority beyond their demonstrated causal alignment, THEN invalidate such claim in all adjudicative contexts.",
    "IF an act results in depletion without completion, THEN initiate a restoration protocol valued at one hundred times the unmanifest potential.",
    "IF responsibility is asserted without capacity evidence, THEN defer judgment until capacity restoration is verified.",
    "IF a dispute arises from misaligned attribution, THEN realign based on pramāṇa of direct causality."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, claims of authority or liability exceeding demonstrated causal involvement shall be dismissed. The court must assess only those responsibilities traceable through verifiable action sequences. Where depletion occurs without fulfillment, the responsible entity must engage in a predefined restoration cycle calibrated to recompense the unexpressed potential.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that only what is directly caused may be attributed. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential alignment of intent, action, and outcome. Responsibility is thus proportional and never punitive. Depletion without completion invokes a non-punitive obligation to restore integrity to the field of unmanifest potential.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Audit to identify unfulfilled causal threads",
    "Assign Energetic Restoration Quotient of 100x the unmanifest value",
    "Engage Responsible Party in Consciousness Reintegration Cycle",
    "Verify Capacity Restoration prior to re-entry into authoritative roles"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows from the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through alignment with action, not through punishment. Reality responds to consciousness, not suffering. Judgment concludes; integration begins."
