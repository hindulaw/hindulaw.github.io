  "sanskrit_verse": "सोऽस्य कार्याणि सम्पश्येत्सभ्यैरेव त्रिभिर्वृतः ।\nसभामेव प्रविश्याग्र्यामासीनः स्थित एव वा ॥ ८.१०॥",
  "transliteration": "so'sya kāryāṇi sampaśyet sabhyaireva tribhirvṛtaḥ |\nsabhāmeva praviśyāgryām āsīnaḥ sthita eva vā || 8.10||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He shall examine his duties only in the company of three advisors drawn from among the assembly members; whether seated at the foremost place within the assembly or merely present therein.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is contextual and relational, requiring validation through collective wisdom.",
    "Causation arises through conscious consultation and not unilateral decision-making.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility necessitates alignment with qualified witnesses and advisors.",
    "Restoration logic demands transparency and inclusion in judicial review processes.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through collaborative discernment rooted in dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler performs judicial or executive action THEN it MUST be witnessed by a minimum of three assembly-approved advisors.",
    "IF a ruler enters a council chamber OR sits in its highest seat THEN all actions are deemed public and subject to dharmic audit.",
    "IF a ruler acts without required advisory presence THEN the act is void until ratified by proper counsel.",
    "IF a ruler remains seated in council THEN observation implies consent and shared accountability.",
    "IF any act bypasses prescribed witness protocol THEN automatic restoration procedure initiates via retrial with full council participation."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle establishes that no judicial ruling can originate from individual authority alone. The threshold of responsibility requires tripartite confirmation by recognized sabhyas. Hierarchical adjudication must reflect visible and verifiable consultation. Retributive outcomes hold no validity; only rulings that restore systemic integrity through transparent consensus carry enforceable weight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that valid judgment emerges exclusively through witnessed deliberation. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of truth when supported by multiple conscious validators. Proportional responsibility lies not in punitive consequence but in ensuring completion of the correct process. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that error correction occurs through reintegration into lawful procedure rather than imposition of penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate mandatory reconvening of the full sabhā for retrospective witnessing of omitted decisions.",
    "Assign designated sabhyas to guide the ruler through completion of unobserved procedural steps.",
    "Restore legitimacy of questioned acts only upon documented re-enactment under proper advisory oversight.",
    "Implement integrity audits where advisors affirm their role in past and future counsel sessions.",
    "Realign consciousness of involved parties through guided sākṣhātkaar (direct realization) of dharma-appropriate governance."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Dharma stands reaffirmed as consciousness-guided governance. All judgments derive validity solely through witnessed alignment with sabhā-sanctioned advisors. Reality remains non-punitive, ever-inviting return to right order through completion, reintegration, and awakened responsibility. Consciousness alone adjudicates eternally."
