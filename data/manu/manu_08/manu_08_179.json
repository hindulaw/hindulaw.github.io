  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is born in a noble lineage, established in righteous conduct, knowledgeable in Dharma, truthful, aligned with great vision, prosperous, and of noble character—into such a being, the wise shall deposit entrusted valuables.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through lineage and conduct",
    "Capacity-based trustworthiness",
    "Dharma-knowledge as legal threshold",
    "Truth-speaking as adjudicative integrity",
    "Wealth as capacity indicator",
    "Nobility as consciousness alignment"

  "supreme_court_application": "Only those whose consciousness is proven aligned with Dharma, whose conduct is impeccable, and whose capacity to hold wealth without distortion is verified, may be entrusted with high-value deposits. The Supreme Court must validate such individuals through pramana-based inquiry before recognizing any fiduciary relationship.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that nobility of birth, conduct, and knowledge creates natural fitness for trusteeship. Misplaced trust arises from incomplete pramāṇa, not malice. Responsibility flows from capacity; misplacement initiates restoration, not retribution. Sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) shows that misplaced trust reveals gaps in verification, requiring completion rather than condemnation.",

  "final_declaration": "This directive flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored by aligning capacity with responsibility. There is no punishment—only completion. Consciousness alone is the final adjudicator."
