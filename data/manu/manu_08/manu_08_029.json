  "sanskrit_verse": "जीवन्तीनां तु तासां ये तधरेयुः स्वबान्धवाः ।\nतांशिष्यात्चौरदण्डेन धार्मिकः पृथिवीपतिः ॥ ८.२९॥",
  "transliteration": "jīvantīnāṃ tu tāsāṃ ye tadhareyuḥ svabāndhavāḥ |\ntāṃśiṣyātcauradaṇḍena dhārmikaḥ pṛthivīpatiḥ || 8.29||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those relatives who abandon living women under their protection shall be disciplined by the king through the cauradanda process, in accordance with dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The king holds executive capacity to enforce dharmic duty among kinship structures.",
    "Causation: Abandonment disrupts social integrity and invokes royal corrective action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Kin bear primary guardianship obligations toward dependent women.",
    "Restoration logic: Correction aims at restoring relational and societal coherence.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Enforcement aligns violators with their inherent custodial dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a male relative abandons a woman under his care AND she remains alive THEN the ruler MUST invoke the caura-danda protocol.",
    "IF a guardian fails custodial duty WITHOUT transferring lawful charge THEN automatic review by royal tribunal occurs.",
    "IF abandonment causes disruption in familial-social order THEN restorative completion process initiates immediately.",
    "IF any violation of protective custody occurs THEN it triggers mandatory reintegration pathway for both victim and violator."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that failure of kin-based custodianship invokes direct kingly intervention. The threshold lies in demonstrable desertion while the subject remains alive. Responsibility flows upward from family unit to sovereign authority when dharma is unmet within private domains.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals causal sequence: abandonment → vulnerability → societal breach → royal response. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional correction without punitive intent. The cauradanda mechanism serves as a consciousness-reset tool rather than infliction. Responsibility aligns with capacity; thus, neglecting one's role incurs structured restoration, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where abandoned individual receives full reinstatement of support system.",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol to nearest capable kin or state institution.",
    "Enforce ritual and legal reintegration of errant relative after fulfilling restitution cycle.",
    "Undertake public dharmic education to reaffirm custodial roles within extended family units."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law proceeds. Dharma is restored. No punishment exists—only alignment with consciousness. Reality responds to duty fulfilled or neglected. The king executes, the people awaken, and dharma prevails."
