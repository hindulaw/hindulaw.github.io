  "transliteration": "yaḥ sādhayantaṃ chandena vedayeddhanikaṃ nṛpe |\nsa rājñā tatcaturbhāgaṃ dāpyastasya ca tadhanam || 8.176||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who knowingly informs the king of a person engaged in improper acquisition of wealth shall receive one-fourth of that wealth as lawful compensation, with the remainder returned to its rightful source.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's capacity to restore order",
    "Causation arises through conscious disclosure of misaligned action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies to those aware of dharmic deviation",
    "Restoration logic ensures displaced value returns to its origin",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when knowledge activates corrective flow"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A knowingly reports misconduct M involving asset X to sovereign S, THEN A receives 0.25 * value(X) AND remaining 0.75 * value(X) is redirected to lawful owner O",
    "IF reported action lacks conscious intent OR factual basis, THEN no redistribution occurs AND reporter assumes alignment review",
    "IF sovereign system detects pattern of false reporting FROM agent A, THEN initiate integrity reintegration FOR A before further disclosures allowed"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold where only verifiable, conscious disclosures activate financial restoration. The court must ensure the informant possesses direct knowledge and absence of malice. Authority lies not in punitive seizure but in calibrated reallocation under sovereign oversight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that accurate knowledge-reporting initiates lawful correction. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as: misconduct → detection → disclosure → realignment. Proportional responsibility assigns reward without creating victim-offender duality. Non-punitive reality rule affirms all parties participate in restoring systemic balance rather than assigning blame.",

    "Completion Process: Informant completes legal declaration affirming firsthand knowledge",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Sovereign assumes custodianship of assets pending verification",
    "Capacity Restoration: Misconduct actor undergoes consciousness rehabilitation prior to reintegration",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Financial flow realigned according to original dharmic entitlement"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned action. No punishment exists; only completion flows. Reality responds to awareness. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
