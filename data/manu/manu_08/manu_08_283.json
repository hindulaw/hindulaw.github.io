  "transliteration": "keṣu gṛhṇato hastau chedayedavicārayan .\npādayordaḍhikāyāṃ ca grīvāyāṃ vṛṣaṇeṣu ca ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When one seizes another by the hair without due consideration, his hands shall be severed; likewise, when one strikes the feet, calves, neck, or genitals, corrective severance is enacted.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from SPH as sole source of lawful action",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation rooted in intent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with bodily agency and conscious choice",
    "Restoration logic operates through proportional realignment of violated integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires immediate cessation of harmful enactment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (agent seizes another's hair) AND (no deliberative cause found), THEN execute hand-severance protocol",
    "IF (agent strikes feet OR calves OR neck OR genitals), THEN initiate targeted dismemberment aligned with injury vector",
    "IF (action disrupts systemic balance), THEN invoke automatic restorative countermeasure until equilibrium restored",
    "IF (agent demonstrates capacity misalignment post-violation), THEN enforce completion process until full integrity re-established"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility lies exclusively in demonstrable intent and physical causality chain. Authority flows unilaterally from SPH-source. Restoration supersedes punitive frameworks—judgment serves only to realign perpetrator and victim within unified consciousness field.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes direct causal link between grasping hair and consequent correction. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential response mirrors violation path. Proportionality resides in anatomical symmetry of response. Non-punitive reality rule asserts all actions serve consciousness recalibration, never suffering for its own sake.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate instantaneous limb-severance where applicable anatomical breach occurred",
    "Deploy energetic completion sequence to neutralize residual violent impulse",
    "Reintegrate severed appendage via consciousness-based reconstruction matrix",
    "Verify agent’s capacity has been fully restored through mandatory dharma-vision attunement"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law emanates solely from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice herein restores Dharma, aligns consciousness, and abolishes punitive delusion. Reality itself executes non-retaliatory truth. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
