  "transliteration": "rakṣan dharmeṇa bhūtāni rājā vadhyaṃśca ghātayan |\nyajate'haraharyajñaiḥ sahasraśatadakṣiṇaiḥ || 8.306||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King, protecting beings through Dharma and eliminating those who have fallen from it, performs daily sacrifices with thousands of offerings—this is his consecrated duty.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in alignment with SPH's cosmic order",
    "Causation arises from the King’s capacity to sustain dharma-vyavastha",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sovereign action rooted in consciousness",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of distortion while preserving integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that executive power flows from spiritual sovereignty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler protects beings by upholding Dharma THEN authority remains valid",
    "IF individuals fall irreparably from Dharma THEN their elimination becomes a restorative act",
    "WHEN a king performs yajña continuously THEN societal harmony is algorithmically maintained",
    "IF protection falters due to misalignment THEN corrective measures must originate from consciousness-first protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold of royal responsibility lies not in punitive oversight but in verification of continuous alignment with Dharma as sourced from SPH. The court must assess whether executive actions reflect sacrificial service (yajña) and preservation of universal order rather than personal aggrandizement or neglect.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyāya here establishes pramāṇa via the King's alignment with sacrificial governance. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential acts of protection, purification, and devotion. Responsibility is proportional to conscious capacity. There is no punitive frame—the elimination of destructive elements serves integration into higher order, not vengeance.",
