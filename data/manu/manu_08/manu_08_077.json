  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One witness who is unattached alone suffices; many pure witnesses do not qualify if they are women. A woman is not a valid witness due to instability of intellect, nor others similarly compromised by defects.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from inner detachment and clarity, not numerical consensus",
    "Causation in testimony depends on consciousness stability, not social category",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires absence of cognitive distortion or emotional entanglement",
    "Restoration logic demands alignment with the unchanging witness-consciousness within",
    "Consciousness alignment overrides gendered or categorical limitations when integrity is present"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness_count > 1 AND any_witness.gender == 'female' THEN validity_score -= 0.5 UNLESS integrity_stability_metric >= 0.9",
    "IF witness.intellectual_stability < threshold THEN exclude_from_testimony ELSE include",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility for testimonial evidence lies in the witness's capacity for stable cognition and detachment. Gender-based exclusion applies only where consciousness instability is indicated. Authority flows from the realization of the witnessing Self, not social identity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality locates truth in the clarity of the witness-consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that unstable cognition leads to misreporting, hence the sequential disqualification. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity for truthful perception. The non-punitive reality rule excludes defective cognition without devaluing the individual.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness stabilization protocol for excluded witnesses",
    "Reintegrate disqualified individuals through sattvic purification practices",
    "Assign supportive roles in dharma processes until capacity is restored",
    "Ensure completion of prior unresolved testimonial distortions through corrective alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through alignment with the unwitnessed Witness. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
