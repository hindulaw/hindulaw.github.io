  "transliteration": "te pṛṣṭāstu yathā brūyuḥ sīmāsaṃdhiṣu lakṣaṇam | tattathā sthāpayedrājā dharmeṇa grāmayordvayoḥ || 8.261||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When questioned, the boundary markers shall declare the signs of territorial junction; the king shall establish accordingly, by Dharma, between two villages.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the declarative integrity of established boundaries",
    "Causation arises from clear demarcation and mutual recognition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies with the sovereign to align territory with Dharma",
    "Restoration logic requires harmonization of contested spaces through conscious witnessing",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when jurisdiction reflects cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF boundary dispute EXISTS THEN consult fixed landmarks AS declared by local testimony",
    "IF testimonial consensus CONFIRMS landmark THEN sovereign MUST align territorial division WITH Dharmic principle",
    "IF village boundaries OVERLAP THEN initiate completion process TO restore clarity OF spatial dharma",
    "IF king receives conflicting claims THEN validate based ON witnessed continuity OF settled markers"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, territorial disputes must invoke foundational witness structures—landmarks or long-standing customs—as primary pramāṇa. The court assumes a mediating role to ensure alignment with Dharmic geography rather than punitive settlement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is derived from visible, enduring markers that reflect anupūrvaśaḥ—the natural unfolding of settled space. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity of the ruler to uphold clarity. There is no fault assigned; only realignment toward harmony.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: boundaries are reflections of consciousness made manifest. Disputes dissolve when Dharma governs perception. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
