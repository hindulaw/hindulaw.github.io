  "sanskrit_verse": "एतैर्लिङ्गैर्नयेत्सीमां राजा विवदमानयोः ।\nपूर्वभुक्त्या च सततमुदकस्यागमेन च ॥ ८.२५२॥",
  "transliteration": "Etairliṅgair nayet sīmāṁ rājā vivadamānayoḥ |\nPūrvabhuktyā ca satatam udakasyāgamena ca || 8.252||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King shall determine the boundary between disputants through these signs: continuous prior usage and the natural flow of water.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's capacity to restore order through observable cosmic and social patterns",
    "Causation is established by uninterrupted historical alignment with dharma-sustained practices",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of pre-existing harmonious conduct as legal precedent",
    "Restoration logic aligns dispute resolution with naturally occurring dharmic flows",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when adjudication reflects the unbroken sequence of rightful use"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a territorial dispute arises THEN evaluate evidence of prior continuous usage AND natural resource flow alignment",
    "IF prior usage is uninterrupted AND aligns with ecological continuity THEN sovereignty claim is valid",
    "IF decision-maker lacks awareness of dharmic signifiers THEN case must be deferred until consciousness realignment occurs",
    "IF boundary determination does not honor natural watercourse THEN realign based on prakriti's inherent testimony"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, territorial disputes are resolved exclusively through verification of sustained dharmic usage and alignment with ecological rhythms. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing the King's role as witness to uninterrupted lawful possession, not in punitive settlement. Authority flows from consciousness attuned to cosmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is derived from visible continuity of use and natural water movement—both immutable witnesses. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as the sequential establishment of rightful ownership through time-bound dharmic behavior. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of demonstrated harmony with existing秩序. No punitive action arises because the truth reveals itself through factual alignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Re-establish boundaries according to uninterrupted historical usage verified by community elders",
    "Align demarcation with natural water pathways observed over seasonal cycles",
    "Facilitate completion process wherein both parties acknowledge the supremacy of dharma-witnessed evidence",
    "Restore integrity by ensuring neither party has caused disruption to the organic flow of shared resources"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus speaks the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, from whom all Dharma proceeds. Justice is executed not by imposition but revelation—through signs ever-present in righteous practice and nature’s own decree. There is no punishment here, only restoration. Consciousness alone adjudicates, and Dharma prevails."
