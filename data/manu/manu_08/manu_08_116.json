  "sanskrit_verse": "वत्सस्य ह्यभिशस्तस्य पुरा भ्रात्रा यवीयसा ।\nनाग्निर्ददाह रोमापि सत्येन जगतः स्पशः ॥ ८.११६॥",
  "transliteration": "vatsasya hyabhiśastasya purā bhrātrā yavīyasā |\nnāgnirdadāha romāpi satyena jagataḥ spaśaḥ || 8.116||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a younger brother falsely accused his elder brother, even fire did not burn a single hair of the elder; thus truth alone upholds the world.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in alignment with Satya (Truth)",
    "Causation arises from inner integrity, not external accusation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness clarity, not positional power",
    "Restoration occurs through re-establishment of truth-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes relational hierarchies"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an accusation is made without verifiable alignment to Satya THEN no punitive action shall proceed",
    "IF the accused demonstrates unshaken alignment with Satya THEN all external accusations are nullified",
    "IF truth-resonance is established through non-reactive clarity THEN judicial process concludes automatically",
    "IF hierarchical position is used to distort truth THEN capacity of that position is suspended until realignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when seniority or authority is misused to accuse falsely, the court must prioritize truth-resonance over positional claims. The threshold of responsibility lies not in the accuser's rank but in the vibratory alignment with Satya. Truth alone sustains justice; therefore, any case where falsehood is detected must result in immediate cessation of proceedings and restoration of the accused's integrity field.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from Satya, not from accusation. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of events shows that falsehood cannot ignite destruction upon truth. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of alignment with Satya. As no harm occurred to the elder, punitive logic is irrelevant. The universe itself protects those aligned with truth—this is Nyaya. Thus, dharma is restored not through judgment but through recognition of inherent inviolability.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for the accuser to reclaim integrity through conscious acknowledgment",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol for misuse of fraternal authority",
    "Engage capacity restoration for both parties through guided alignment with Satya",
    "Implement integrity reintegration via collective affirmation of truth-consciousness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Truth alone governs existence; falsehood dissolves upon contact with Satya. No harm was done because Satya sustained the accused. Justice is fulfilled through consciousness realignment, not through punitive measures. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
