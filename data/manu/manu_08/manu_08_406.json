On clear boundaries (like rivers), precise adherence is required. In undefined domains (like oceans), rigid signs are irrelevant—judgment must arise from inner alignment with dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality here shows that dharmic response must match perceptual context. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive awareness of situational capacity.
