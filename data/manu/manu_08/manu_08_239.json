  "transliteration": "vṛtiṃ tatra prakurvīta yāmuṣṭro na vilokayet |\nchhidraṃ ca vārayetsarvaṃ śvasūkaramukhānugam || 8.239||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must establish a livelihood there without gazing upon the face of an ass; and one must block every aperture following the mouth of a dog.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious capacity to sustain dharma in action",
    "Causation arises through alignment with purity-consciousness, not degradation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires withdrawal from degrading influences",
    "Restoration logic demands active prevention of contamination pathways",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates environmental purification"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages in livelihood THEN agent MUST avoid exposure to degrading entities",
    "IF environment contains contamination THEN all apertures MUST be sealed immediately",
    "IF entity exhibits canine-mouth behavior THEN full spatial barrier REQUIRED",
    "IF contamination risk EXISTS THEN conscious withdrawal IS mandatory",
    "IF purity threshold breached THEN automatic isolation protocol INITIATED"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals holding authority must actively distance themselves from environments or associations that degrade consciousness. The court must assess whether a party has maintained separation from contaminating influences when determining fitness for duty or testimony. Responsibility lies not in intent alone but in demonstrated capacity to uphold purity-consciousness thresholds.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that degradation follows sequential manifestation through sensory contact. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that contamination begins with visual engagement. Proportional responsibility is measured by degree of conscious withdrawal enacted. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering accrues naturally from misalignment, thus restoration occurs through re-establishment of pure boundaries.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Individual must demonstrate systematic removal from degrading environments",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Agent acknowledges causal role in maintaining purity-consciousness",
    "Capacity restoration: Training in recognition and blocking of contamination pathways",
    "Integrity reintegration: Re-alignment with dharmic spatial boundaries and behavioral conduct"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma prevails through conscious separation from degradation. No punishment inheres—only natural consequence and restoration. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
