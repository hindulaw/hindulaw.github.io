  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a gift is mentally envisioned but not yet physically delivered, the prior declared law applies; however, upon the death of the donor, even if the formal transfer was incomplete, the inheritance obligation must still be executed by the heirs.",

    "Authority rests in the continuity of intent beyond physical act",
    "Causation includes mental formation and declared will",
