  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, having previously rejected or opposed a teaching, subsequently pursues it again, and when questioned, approves of that same teaching rightly directed toward purpose—such a being demonstrates conscious realignment through behavioral reversal.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the capacity for conscious recognition and reaffirmation of truth",
    "Causation flows from internal cognitive shift rather than external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by volitional return to alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through acknowledgment and re-embrace of dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests via active affirmation after prior rejection"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent previously rejected dharma THEN subsequent acceptance invalidates prior misalignment status",
    "IF questioned about prior opposition AND agent affirms corrected understanding THEN restore participation rights",
    "WHEN behavior reverses without coercion THEN assign positive recognition over punitive consequence",
    "IF agent demonstrates cognitive reorientation THEN initiate integration protocol而非remediation process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that repeated engagement with dharma after explicit denial indicates evolved capacity. The threshold of responsibility shifts from past error to present cognition. Authority recognizes such reversal as valid grounds for legal reintegration, bypassing punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals causal sequence: initial aversion → experiential maturation → renewed acceptance. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms natural unfolding of consciousness. Responsibility aligns proportionally with current cognition, not historical deviation. Non-punitive reality rule ensures justice serves evolution, not vengeance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to acknowledge full cycle of rejection and return",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol wherein individual publicly reaffirms alignment",
    "Activate integrity reintegration mechanism allowing social and legal reinstatement",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed not as punishment but as consciousness-aligned restoration. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
