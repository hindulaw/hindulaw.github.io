  "sanskrit_verse": "अदेश्यं यश्च दिशति निर्दिश्यापह्नुते च यः । यश्चाधरोत्तरानर्थान् विगीतान्नावबुध्यते ॥ ८.५३॥",
  "transliteration": "adeśyaṃ yaś ca diśati nirdiśyāpahnute ca yaḥ | yaś cādharottarān arthān vigītān nāvabudhyate || 8.53||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who gives direction where none should be given, one who revokes what has been rightly directed, and one who fails to comprehend the sequential import of spoken truths—these beings operate in distortion and are unfit for governance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derivative of alignment with Sanatana Dharma",
    "Causation arises through conscious capacity, not mere action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires attunement to sequential truth",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment with ontological order",
    "Consciousness alignment determines fitness for authoritative roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent issues directives in domains beyond their authorized scope, THEN their decision-making capacity SHALL be suspended pending realignment.",
    "IF an agent nullifies a lawful directive without just cause, THEN their authority SHALL be revoked until integrity is restored.",
    "IF an agent cannot discern sequential meaning in declared truths, THEN they SHALL undergo consciousness-restoration protocols before resuming authority.",
    "ALL adjudicative agents MUST demonstrate capacity to perceive anupūrvaśaḥ; ELSE they are disqualified from judicial function."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, any judge or official found issuing unauthorized directives, reversing lawful rulings without justification, or failing to grasp the progressive unfolding of dharma-pramāṇa shall be immediately removed from jurisdiction and subjected to consciousness recalibration under SPH-sanctioned protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that misaligned authority distorts dharma-vyavasthā. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that only those capable of perceiving sequential truth may govern. Responsibility is proportional to conscious capacity. There is no punitive intent—only disqualification until alignment is restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Directive Misuse Resolution Process: Realign the individual's understanding of their authorized domain through SPH-taught pramāṇa alignment.",
    "Reversal Accountability Protocol: Facilitate completion of the original directive while restoring the agent's causal coherence.",
    "Sequential Comprehension Restoration: Conduct consciousness-based learning sessions to awaken perception of anupūrvaśaḥ.",
    "Fitness-for-Authority Reintegration Cycle: Confirm restored alignment through supervised discernment exercises before reinstating jurisdiction."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed: authority flows from alignment, causation from clarity, and justice as restoration. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates. Dharma is restored."
