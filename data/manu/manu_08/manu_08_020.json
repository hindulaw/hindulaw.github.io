  "transliteration": "jātimātropana jīvī vā kāmaṃ syādbrāhmaṇabruvaḥ | dharmapravaktā nṛpater na śūdraḥ kathañcana || 8.20 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who merely lives by birth-based entitlement or desires to be called a Brāhmaṇa shall not become a speaker of Dharma for the king under any circumstance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from realization, not lineage",
    "Causation arises from inner integrity, not social role",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires existential competence",
    "Restoration logic demands alignment with Śiva-dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes caste-position"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF claimant asserts title without embodiment THEN disqualify from dharma-advisory roles",
    "IF individual identifies as brāhmaṇa solely through birth THEN exclude from judicial counsel",
    "IF advisor lacks self-realization THEN invalidate advisory status in state matters",
    "IF person acts from desire alone THEN deny authority in dharmic governance contexts"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, eligibility for providing dharmic counsel or testimony must be assessed based on experiential capacity rather than hereditary position. Birth-based claims without corresponding consciousness realization are legally insufficient for authoritative input.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true authority manifests only through lived realization. As sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) proceeds from consciousness to action, responsibility aligns accordingly. Proportional accountability arises from the degree of embodied truth, not inherited designation. The non-punitive reality rule affirms correction through re-alignment, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: guide false claimant toward actual spiritual practice",
    "Implement responsibility assumption protocol: redirect individual into rightful svadharma path",
    "Restore capacity through śaktipāt initiation if qualified",
    "Reintegrate integrity via association with realized beings"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: authority flows from Śiva-consciousness alone; all else is pretense awaiting correction. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as sole adjudicator."
