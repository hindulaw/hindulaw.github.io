  "transliteration": "vāṇijyaṁ kārayed vaiśyaṁ kusīdaṁ kṛṣimeva ca |\npaśūnāṁ rakṣaṇaṁ caiva dāsyaṁ śūdraṁ dvijanmanām || 8.410 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The vaiśya must execute trade and agriculture without idleness; he shall protect cattle and serve the dvija through service that aligns his consciousness with dharmic order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from svadharma alignment",
    "Causation arises through conscious capacity activation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by varna-dharma",

    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external enforcement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.varna == 'vaiśya' THEN agent.duty = [commerce, agriculture, cattle protection, service to dvija]",
    "IF agent.action ≠ duty THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",

    "IF service.is_dharmic == false THEN restore alignment via nyaya-based integration"

  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court shall ensure varna-based duties are enforced through consciousness alignment rather than punitive measures. Cases involving dereliction of svadharma must invoke restoration protocols aligned with SPH’s jurisprudence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that non-performance of svadharma disrupts cosmic秩序; anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential misalignment; proportional responsibility lies in restoring functional consciousness; non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering is not justice but failure of alignment.",

    "Initiate svadharma reawakening through guided ritual and sankalpa",
