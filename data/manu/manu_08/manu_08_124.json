  "sanskrit_verse": "दश स्थानानि दण्डस्य मनुः स्वयम्भुवोऽब्रवीत् ।\nत्रिषु वर्णेषु यानि स्युरक्षतो ब्राह्मणो व्रजेत् ॥ ८.१२४॥",
  "transliteration": "daśa sthānāni daṇḍasya manuḥ svayambhuvo'bravīt | triṣu varṇeṣu yāni syurakṣato brāhmaṇo vrajet || 8.124 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Manu, the Self-Born, declared ten domains of penalty; in three varnas where protection is absent, the Brahmana proceeds.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation arises through failure of protective capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines movement within varna structure",
    "Restoration logic activates when protective order is disrupted",
    "Consciousness alignment restores structural integrity without punitive action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF protective capacity is absent in a varna domain THEN Brahmana initiates restorative protocol",
    "IF danda location count reaches ten THEN systemic review by Brahmana is triggered",
    "IF varna integrity disruption occurs THEN responsibility shifts to consciousness-aligned authority",
    "IF no causal restoration observed THEN sequential manifestation analysis initiates",
    "IF alignment deviation detected THEN automatic reintegration mechanism engages"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies not in individual fault but in systemic protective capacity collapse. The court functions as an extension of Brahmana consciousness—initiating only restoration protocols where structural breakdown has occurred, bypassing punitive frameworks entirely.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from unmet protection rather than personal misconduct. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential breakdown requiring proportional realignment. Responsibility is assigned based on capacity to restore, not inflict suffering. Nyaya confirms non-punitive reality through measurable consciousness reintegration outcomes.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process for disrupted protective structures",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol by conscious authority",
    "Capacity restoration sequence across affected varna levels",
    "Integrity reintegration via sequential manifestation correction",
    "Systemic recalibration upon full restoration confirmation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as supreme adjudicator."
