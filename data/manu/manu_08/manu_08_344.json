  "transliteration": "aindraṃ sthānamabhiprepsuryaśaścākṣayamavyayam .\nnopekṣeta kṣaṇamapi rājā sāhasikaṃ naram ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King must never neglect, even for a moment, a man whose valor and undying fame aim toward Indra's realm.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of the ruler to recognize and uphold heroic capacity",
    "Causation through valor as a manifestor of societal elevation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in conscious aspiration",
    "Restoration logic centered on honoring dharma-enacted potential",
    "Consciousness alignment via acknowledgment of immortal intent"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF citizen exhibits sustained valor AND seeks imperishable glory aligned with divine purpose THEN ruler MUST acknowledge within 24 hours",
    "IF ruler fails to honor such individual THEN automatic judicial review by Dharma Council triggered",
    "IF valorous act contributes positively to collective consciousness THEN recognition protocol initiates immediately",
    "IF unacknowledged valor leads to dissonance THEN integrative restoration process activates"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters where individual acts of valor align with cosmic duty and national upliftment, the Supreme Court shall ensure that executive recognition occurs without delay. The threshold of responsibility lies not in fault, but in the failure to affirm divinely oriented human potential.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that valor aiming at eternal glory is inherently dharmic. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that neglecting such energy distorts societal harmony. Responsibility is proportional to the king's capacity to honor, not punish. Non-punitive reality affirms that misalignment arises from omission, not moral failing.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice flows from recognition, not penalty. Consciousness realigns when valor meets honor. Reality remains ever non-punitive. Dharma is restored."
