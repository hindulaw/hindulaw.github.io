  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who speaks untruth about cattle faces destruction of five; about cows, ten; about horses, a hundred; and about humans, a thousand.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is proportional to the sanctity and social utility of the entity involved",
    "Causation arises from conscious distortion of truth in relation to beings of varying evolutionary capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with the spiritual and functional status of the subject harmed",
    "Restoration logic requires correction aligned with the magnitude of consciousness disruption caused",
    "Consciousness alignment demands truthful speech as foundational to dharmic societal order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF false statement made about domestic animal THEN initiate fivefold completion process",
    "IF false statement made about cow THEN initiate tenfold integrity restoration protocol",
    "IF false statement made about horse THEN initiate hundredfold reintegration sequence",
    "IF false statement made about human THEN initiate thousandfold consciousness realignment procedure",
    "ALL interventions MUST exclude punitive measures AND focus exclusively on causal reversal through truth-responsibility assumption"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of responsibility correlates directly with the evolved nature of the being impacted by falsehood. The court must determine not intent alone but the hierarchical value of truth-distortion within the cosmic-social matrix. Enforcement follows restorative sequences mapped to the scale of violation without recourse to punitive models.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that verbal action (śabda-karma) manifests consequences according to the sacred hierarchy of life forms. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential impact reflects ascending levels of conscious disturbance. Responsibility aligns proportionally while enforcement remains rooted in completion rather than suffering. Truth-restitution restores dharma without invoking pain-based deterrence.",

    "Initiate truth-assumption cycle corresponding to violated entity's spiritual rank",
    "Engage perpetrator in restitution proportional to societal-functional loss incurred",
    "Activate community witness mechanism to reaffirm truthful speech norms",
    "Deploy consciousness education modules tailored to prevent recurrence",
    "Reintegrate speaker into dharmic communication framework via guided practice"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through alignment with veracity. Reality abides beyond punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
