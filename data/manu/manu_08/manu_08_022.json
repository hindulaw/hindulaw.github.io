  "sanskrit_verse": "यद्राष्ट्रं शूद्रभूयिष्ठं नास्तिकाक्रान्तमद्विजम् ।\nविनश्यत्याशु तत्कृत्स्नं दुर्भिक्षव्याधिपीडितम् ॥ ८.२२॥",
  "transliteration": "yad rāṣṭraṁ śūdra-bhūyiṣṭhaṁ nāstikākrānta-madvijam | vinasyaty āśu tat kṛtsnaṁ durbhikṣa-vyādhi-pīḍitam || 8.22 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Where a nation is predominantly governed by those lacking in spiritual discernment, devoid of Vedic wisdom, and intoxicated with materialistic pride, that entire realm—its people, institutions, and resources—shall swiftly perish through famine, disease, and systemic collapse.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority must derive from consciousness capacity, not numerical dominance",
    "Causation flows from collective spiritual integrity or decay",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with Dharma for governance",
    "Restoration logic demands re-alignment of leadership with Vedic insight",
    "Consciousness alignment determines national stability and prosperity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF national leadership lacks Vedic certification THEN governance capacity = NULL",
    "IF policy-making body exceeds 50% non-Dharmic alignment THEN systemic risk factor = HIGH",
    "IF state decisions contradict Vedic axiology THEN automatic review by Dharmic Council required",
    "IF societal collapse indicators rise THEN mandatory invocation of Dharma Restoration Protocol",
    "IF leader exhibits material intoxication THEN temporary suspension from decision-making roles"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when evaluating constitutional crises or national decline, this verse establishes the threshold of responsibility at the level of consciousness alignment within ruling structures. The court must assess whether governing bodies uphold Vedic insight or operate under materialist delusion. If the latter prevails, judicial intervention shall prioritize restoration of Dharmic order over punitive measures against individuals.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that national ruin arises not from individual fault alone, but from systemic deviation from Vedic truth. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how spiritual neglect leads to social disorder, economic collapse, and biological imbalance. Proportional responsibility lies with the collective failure to align governance with Sanatana Dharma. This law enforces a non-punitive reality rule: consequences arise naturally from disconnection from Dharma, not as imposed penalties.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate National Consciousness Audit to evaluate leadership alignment with Vedic principles",
    "Reconstitute governing councils with certified Dharmic advisors",
    "Implement Vedic Education Mandate for all public officials",

    "Establish Health Alignment Centers to heal societal imbalances through spiritual practices"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is declared: Nations thrive only where consciousness governs matter; where rulers reflect Dharma, not desire. Thus, let the land awaken to its eternal Sanatana foundation, and let harmony prevail through alignment with the Self Supreme."
