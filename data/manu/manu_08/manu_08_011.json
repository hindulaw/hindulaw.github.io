  "transliteration": "yasmin deśe niṣīdanti viprā vedavidas trayaḥ |\nrājñaś cādhikṛto vidvān brahmaṇas tāṃ sabhāṃ viduḥ || 8.11||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That assembly is recognized as belonging to Brahman where the three Vedically learned Brahmins reside and where a king's appointed wise counselor sits.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from Vedic alignment and conscious capacity",
    "Causation originates in alignment with Brahmanic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires Vedic wisdom integration",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to Vedic governance structures",
    "Consciousness alignment is maintained by seating qualified knowers in positions of authority"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF assembly includes three Veda-knowing Brahmins AND includes king-appointed wise counselor THEN assembly is validly Brahman-authorized",
    "IF individual lacks Vedic knowledge AND occupies judicial or ruling seat THEN disqualify automatically without punitive record",
    "IF council does not reflect Vedic-knowing presence THEN decisions are void until reconstituted under qualified guidance",
    "IF ruler's advisor is not Veda-rooted THEN advisory function ceases until replaced by qualified knower"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, only those assemblies wherein reside the triad of Veda-knowing Brahmins and the king’s duly authorized wise counselor shall constitute legitimate juridical forums. All other formations lack foundational dharma-authorization and cannot issue lawful verdicts.",
