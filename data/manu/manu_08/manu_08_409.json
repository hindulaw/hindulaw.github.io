  "sanskrit_verse": "एष नौयायिनामुक्तो व्यवहारस्य निर्णयः ।\nदाशापराधतस्तोये दैविके नास्ति निग्रहः ॥ ८.४०९॥",
  "transliteration": "eṣa nauyāyinām ukto vyavahārasya nirṇayaḥ |\ndāśāparādhatas toye daivike nāsti nigrahaḥ || 8.409||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This is the declared judgment for those who navigate—responsibility arising from human error in water-based transactions does not apply when the cause is divine intervention.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from SPH as the ultimate source of Dharma",
    "Causation must distinguish between human agency and divine orchestration",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies only where conscious control exists",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes realignment with cosmic order over attribution of fault",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of legal consequence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action occurs under direct divine causality THEN no human agent bears responsibility",
    "IF event originates from natural or celestial force THEN no punitive or corrective measure is enacted",
    "IF transaction involves water-based medium AND failure stems from unseen forces THEN nullify all claims of liability",
    "IF intent is absent AND outcome is divinely ordained THEN restore affected parties to prior state of integrity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold criterion: when divine causation is established through pramāṇa, no human entity may be held accountable. The court must recognize that outcomes orchestrated by higher consciousness are beyond jurisdiction and require only restoration of involved parties to their original dharmic alignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based discernment reveals that when an act is caused by daiva (divine will), it follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation beyond individual control. Therefore, proportional responsibility does not apply. Nyaya operates not to assign blame but to align consciousness with the truth that only voluntary actions bear karmic weight. Thus, non-punitive reality rule prevails.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to dissolve residual emotional or material entanglement",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol for any human actor whose capacity was misaligned during the incident",
    "Activate integrity reintegration sequence for all affected parties to return to pre-event dharmic balance",
    "Deploy consciousness recalibration mechanism to prevent future misattribution of divine causality as human error"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. The law flows from Divine Will, not punitive intent. Justice serves restoration, not condemnation. Consciousness alone is the true Adjudicator."
