  "sanskrit_verse": "यो निक्षेपं याच्यमानो निक्षेप्तुर्न प्रयच्छति ।\nस याच्यः प्राड्विवाकेन तत्निक्षेप्तुरसंनिधौ ॥ ८.१८१॥",
  "transliteration": "yo nikṣepaṁ yācyamāno nikṣepturna prayacchati |\nsa yācyaḥ prāḍvivākena tatnikṣepturasannidhau || 8.181||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who, being requested, does not deliver a deposited item to its rightful owner—such a one must be summoned in the presence of that depositor through formal declaration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the rightful claimant of a deposit",
    "Causation arises from failure to honor custodial duty",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by possession and intent",
    "Restoration logic demands return of entrusted property",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring relational trust"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity possesses a deposited item AND receives a valid request for its return FROM the depositor THEN the entity MUST transfer possession back TO the depositor",
    "IF an entity fails to execute transfer within prescribed time THEN summoning protocol MUST activate via formal declaration mechanism",
    "IF depositor is absent THEN summons MUST occur in depositor's proximate jurisdiction or designated representative presence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes threshold responsibility upon any custodian of another’s property. The court must ensure summoning occurs under formal declaration when custodial refusal arises, prioritizing restoration of depositor's rights over punitive measures against custodian.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies refusal as root disruption. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces breach from trust-establishment to withholding. Proportional responsibility aligns with custodial capacity. Non-punitive reality rule ensures corrective action restores relational integrity without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Summoning Protocol: Formal declaration issued in depositor's presence or representative assembly",
    "Completion Process: Custodian guided to complete transfer under witness until integrity is restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption: Custodian required to affirm understanding of relational breach before restitution",
    "Capacity Restoration: Meditative reflection mandated prior to reintegration into custodial roles"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
