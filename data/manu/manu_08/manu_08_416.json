  "transliteration": "bhāryā putraśca dāsaśca traya evādhanāḥ smṛtāḥ |\nyatte samadhigacchanti yasya te tasya tad-dhanam || 8.416||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A wife, a son, and a servant—these three alone are declared as non-possessors of property. Whatever they acquire in your presence or through your resources belongs to you.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the source of sustenance and ownership",
    "Causation is determined by resource dependency and existential support",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes differential agency within relational hierarchies",
    "Restoration logic centers on the realignment of possession with rightful stewardship",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of interdependence and structural roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual acquires assets WHILE dependent on another's resources THEN title transfers to the provider automatically",
    "IF a person resides under another’s domain without independent economic capacity THEN their acquisitions belong to the domain holder",
    "IF acquisition occurs through shared infrastructure funded by a superior THEN proportional claim defaults to that superior unless explicitly renounced",
    "IF status reflects reliance而非自主 THEN fruits of action align with foundational support structure"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving familial or servile acquisition, courts must recognize the primacy of structural dependency over nominal agency. Ownership attribution follows the axis of existential support rather than procedural claims. The threshold of responsibility lies in determining who sustains the means for acquisition, not merely witnessing its occurrence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal linkage between sustainer and sustained outcome. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential dependence: without foundational provision, no derivative gain arises. Proportional responsibility assigns ownership where enabling conditions originate. There is no punitive intent; only alignment with natural dharmic order wherein misaligned possession distorts cosmic integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Require all parties to acknowledge the true source of enabling conditions.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Affirm rightful custodianship based on existential causality.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Realign dependent entities toward self-sustaining structures where feasible.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Normalize relationships according to inherent dharmic roles."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Property rights reflect spiritual-economic causality rooted in sustenance dynamics. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as ultimate adjudicator."
