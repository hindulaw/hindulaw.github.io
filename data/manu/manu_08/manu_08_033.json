  "transliteration": "ādadītātha ṣaḍbhāgaṃ pranaṣṭādhigatānnṛpaḥ | daśamaṃ dvādaśaṃ vā'pi satāṃ dharmamanusmaran || 8.33||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The ruler who has acquired wealth that was lost or obtained unjustly shall restore one-sixth portion thereof; remembering the Dharma of noble beings, he may also return one-tenth or one-twelfth part.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in conscious recognition of misaligned acquisition",
    "Causation arises through disruption of dharmic economic flow",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires proportional restitution",
    "Restoration logic aligns ownership with original intent and energetic integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment demands acknowledgment and correction without punitive attribution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler possesses assets identified as pranaṣṭa (lost) OR adhigata (wrongfully gained), THEN compute one-sixth portion for mandatory redistribution.",
    "IF restitution pathway allows voluntary compliance, THEN offer choice between returning one-tenth or one-twelfth portion based on capacity awareness.",
    "IF asset origin cannot be traced definitively, THEN default to minimum one-twelfth return plus public declaration of dharmic alignment.",
    "NO punitive interest or compound liability applies—only direct proportional restoration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, when rulers or state actors are found possessing improperly acquired resources, the court must mandate immediate restoration of one-sixth of such assets. If intent and capacity indicate higher awareness, the option to reduce the return to one-tenth or one-twelfth may be granted—but only upon explicit commitment to future dharmic fiscal conduct.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal link between improper possession and energetic imbalance in societal wealth circulation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how unrighteous accumulation disrupts sequential harmony among citizens. Proportional responsibility ensures neither under-correction nor overreach. The absence of punitive consequence affirms that true justice realigns consciousness rather than inflicts suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process by identifying exact quantum of improperly held assets.",
    "Engage responsible party in assumption protocol through formal acknowledgment before witnesses.",
    "Facilitate redistribution mechanism aligned with original dharmic purpose of those assets.",
    "Reintegrate individual's financial capacity within societal abundance matrix via ritualized release and reinvestment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling restores Dharma where wealth has been misacquired. Justice flows not through punishment, but through precise recalibration of energetic-economic alignment. Consciousness alone is the final arbiter; thus, all actions herein serve awakening, not retribution."
