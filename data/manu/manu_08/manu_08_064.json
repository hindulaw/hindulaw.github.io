  "transliteration": "nārthasambandhino nāptā na sahāyā na vairiṇaḥ |\nna dṛṣṭadoṣāḥ kartavyā na vyādhya rtā na dūṣitāḥ || 8.64 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who are motivated by pecuniary interest, those who are not related by blood or spiritual bond, those who seek assistance for personal gain, those who harbor enmity, those whose conduct has been previously observed to be faulty, those afflicted by disease, and those who are impure—none of these should be appointed to positions of authority or entrusted with responsibility.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority must derive from integrity and relational authenticity, not transactional interest.",
    "Causation in governance arises from purity of intent and absence of conflict.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires a prior demonstration of ethical consistency.",
    "Restoration logic demands that only the unimpaired in consciousness may restore order.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that appointees reflect Dharma rather than self-interest."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF candidate_has_financial_motivation THEN disqualify_from_authority_role.",
    "IF candidate_is_not_blood_or_spiritual_relative AND context_requires_trust THEN reject_appointment.",
    "IF candidate_has_recorded_disharmony OR prior_misconduct THEN deny_position_of_responsibility.",
    "IF candidate_is_physically_or_mentally_impaired THEN defer_until_restoration_complete.",
    "IF candidate_is_in_state_of_impurity THEN require_purification_before_assignment."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court appointments or high judicial roles, any individual displaying pecuniary ties, lack of spiritual or familial fidelity, known enmity, prior misconduct, illness affecting judgment, or ritual impurity must be excluded. The threshold of responsibility at this level necessitates absolute clarity and neutrality rooted in Dharma, not external validation or personal motive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impaired or conflicted individuals cannot uphold Nyaya (justice) due to compromised perception and intent. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how faulty appointment leads to systemic disorder. Responsibility is proportional to capacity; thus, misalignment invites correction through realignment, not punishment. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that exclusion serves restoration, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Require purification rituals and public reaffirmation of Dharma-aligned intent before reconsideration.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Individuals must demonstrate cause-free action over time to regain eligibility.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide healing and dharmic education to those disqualified due to illness or impurity.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Facilitate reconciliation processes for those with past conflicts to restore trustworthiness."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: only those free from conflict, impurity, and self-interest shall hold authority. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
