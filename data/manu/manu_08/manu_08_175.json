  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating executive conduct, the Supreme Court must evaluate not punitive violations but the degree of alignment between leadership actions and dharmic perceptual clarity.

There is no punitive mechanism—only natural law manifesting through consciousness coherence.",
