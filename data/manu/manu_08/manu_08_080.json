  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which both of you know regarding actions performed in this matter, speak it all truthfully—your witnessship here is established by the Supreme Consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the witnessing capacity of the Self",
    "Causation arises from conscious participation in action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined through self-awareness",
    "Restoration occurs when truth aligns with inner witness",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates truthful disclosure"

    "IF truthfulness is aligned with sākṣitva THEN legal standing is automatically validated",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the principle of sākṣitva establishes that where dual parties possess shared experiential knowledge of an act, their reciprocal testimony under alignment with Satya constitutes irrefutable pramāṇa. The court shall invoke the witness-consciousness as the ultimate validator of factual congruence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that mutual witnessing implies shared dharma-field involvement.
