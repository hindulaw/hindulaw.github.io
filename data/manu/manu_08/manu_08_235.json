  "sanskrit_verse": "अजाविके तु संरुद्धे वृकैः पाले त्वनायति ।\nयां प्रसह्य वृको हन्यात्पाले तत्किल्बिषं भवेत् ॥ ८.२३५॥",
  "transliteration": "ajāvike tu saṃruddhe vṛkaiḥ pāle tvanāyati |\nyāṃ prasahya vṛko hanyāt pāle tatkilbiṣaṃ bhavet || 8.235 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a shepherd, obstructed by wolves, fails to protect the flock and a wolf forcibly kills one of the sheep, that act constitutes a transgression of dharma by the shepherd.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from capacity to fulfill duty",
    "Causation arises through omission in the face of preventable harm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires proportional alignment with role and capability",
    "Restoration logic demands reintegration of lost integrity within functional roles",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when one assumes full causal ownership of role-based failure"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent holds protective authority AND agent possesses capacity to act AND harm occurs due to omission THEN assign causal liability to agent",
    "IF protective role is unfulfilled under preventable threat THEN initiate restorative completion protocol for role-holder",
    "IF transgression arises from non-action despite capacity THEN enforce reintegration until systemic balance is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes threshold responsibility based on role-capacity alignment. The shepherd's failure invokes liability not through intent but through the absence of action where capacity existed. The court must assess not only the event but the available means of intervention, assigning restoration protocols accordingly.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies the shepherd’s omission as the root cause. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential breakdown: obstruction by wolves → failure to act → death of sheep. Proportional responsibility lies with the shepherd for not utilizing available capacity. The non-punitive reality rule ensures no suffering is imposed; rather, the shepherd undertakes correction through conscious realignment and role restoration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Shepherd must fully account for all unmet duties related to flock protection",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Shepherd acknowledges causal role in loss without externalization",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Realign shepherd’s consciousness to reclaim full functional capacity",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Shepherd performs corrective acts to restore trust and systemic balance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through conscious realignment. There is no punishment—only restoration. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
