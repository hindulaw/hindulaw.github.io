  "sanskrit_verse": "बहुत्वं परिगृह्णीयात्साक्षिद्वैधे नराधिपः ।\nसमेषु तु गुणोत्कृष्टान् गुणिद्वैधे द्विजोत्तमान् ॥ ८.७३॥",
  "transliteration": "bahutvaṃ parigṛhṇīyāt sākṣidvaide narādhipaḥ |\nsameṣu tu guṇotkṛṣṭān guṇidvaide dvijottamān || 8.73||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the case of conflicting testimonies, the king shall accept the greater number of witnesses. However, when the number of witnesses is equal, he shall select those who are distinguished by excellence in qualities.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the discernment of truth through evidentiary weight and qualitative integrity.",
    "Causation arises from alignment between witness capacity and dharma-sustaining consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates selection based on qualitative superiority where quantitative parity exists.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes truthful resolution over adversarial contest.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that testimony reflects ontological clarity rather than subjective distortion."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness count differs THEN select testimony set with higher numerical strength.",
    "IF witness counts are equal THEN evaluate and rank witnesses by predefined quality metrics: ethical standing, cognitive clarity, absence of conflict.",
    "IF witness quality scores are indistinguishable THEN defer to neutral mediating authority for final determination without punitive inference.",
    "ALL determinations MUST preserve relational harmony and restore integrity of testifying parties."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom applies as a threshold protocol for evidentiary adjudication. When testimonial contradictions arise, numerical preponderance serves as first-order validation. In tie scenarios, judicial review escalates to qualitative assessment grounded in dharmic criteria. No punitive valuation is assigned; all decisions aim at consciousness realignment and societal integration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa operates through perceptual and testimonial convergence. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests via sequential evaluation—first quantity, then quality. Proportional responsibility lies in accurate discernment, not punitive attribution. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that error stems from limited awareness, corrected through dharmic intelligence, not enforced suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Witness Reintegration Process: Post-adjudication debriefing to reaffirm truth-telling commitment.",
    "Qualitative Calibration Protocol: Ongoing training and attunement for witnesses to elevate consciousness clarity.",
    "Relational Harmony Restoration: Mediated reconciliation among involved parties post-decision.",
    "Integrity Reaffirmation Ceremony: Formal acknowledgment of restored trust within community structures."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through conscious discernment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
