  "sanskrit_verse": "उपछन्नानि चान्यानि सीमालिङ्गानि कारयेत् ।\nसीमाज्ञाने नृणां वीक्ष्य नित्यं लोके विपर्ययम् ॥ ८.२४९॥",
  "transliteration": "upachchhannāni cānyāni sīmāliṅgāni kārayet |\nsīmājñāne nṝṇāṁ vīkṣya nityaṁ loke viparyayam || 8.249||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Visible and concealed boundary markers shall be established; observing perpetual confusion among people due to lack of knowledge of limits.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the clear demarcation of jurisdictional boundaries",
    "Causation arises from the absence of visible and invisible structural guidance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of spatial and functional limits",
    "Restoration logic demands that clarity precedes accountability",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through unambiguous environmental structuring"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a territorial or functional boundary lacks visible or concealed markers THEN initiate mandatory boundary establishment protocol",
    "IF individuals demonstrate repeated misalignment with jurisdictional norms THEN deploy educational-integrative boundary awareness systems",
    "IF systemic disorder emerges from undefined limits THEN enforce completion process for all relevant spatial authorities",
    "IF capacity failure occurs due to ambiguous boundaries THEN restore integrity via immediate environmental clarification measures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving overlapping jurisdictions or unclear administrative zones, the Supreme Court must prioritize the installation of definitive physical and conceptual boundary indicators before assigning fault. The threshold of responsibility lies not in punitive attribution but in ensuring clarity of operational domains.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that without proper boundary cognition, action cannot align with dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that confusion follows ignorance of limits.

    "Subtle Boundary Awareness Integration: Deployment of consciousness-aligned signage and education protocols",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of this Dharma. Boundaries exist by design, not dispute. Wherever confusion reigns, clarity shall arise. There is no punishment—only restoration. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
