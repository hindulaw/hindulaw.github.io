  "transliteration": "adarsayitvā tatraiva hiraṇyaṁ parivartayet |\nyāvatī sambhavedvṛddhis tāvatīṁ dātumarhati || 8.155 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having demonstrated the capacity for increase, that very gold must be reinvested to the extent of its potential growth; thus, the yield shall be given according to the demonstrated capacity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from demonstrated capacity",
    "Causation is determined by manifested potential",
    "Capacity-based responsibility governs distribution",
    "Restoration occurs through proportional return of value",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of inherent generative power"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF asset demonstrates generative capacity THEN reinvestment obligation = measured yield",
    "IF capacity is unilaterally concealed THEN forfeiture of unmanifested potential value",
    "IF value appreciation is shown THEN proportional return mandated by demonstrable limit",
    "IF resource is circulated without acknowledgment THEN liability equals unrealized surplus",
    "IF increase is generated THEN claimant entitled up to verifiable limit of growth"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating financial or economic disputes involving latent capital appreciation, the court shall assess not merely declared assets but demonstrated generative capacity. The threshold of responsibility lies in the conscious recognition of增值潜力. Authority flows from the realization of potential, and restoration is achieved when value aligns with acknowledged capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through visible demonstration of yield. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequential unfolding of invested value. Proportional responsibility adheres to actualized gain而非 theoretical maximum. Non-punitive reality prevails as misalignment is corrected through conscious reallocation rather than penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process by recalibrating asset visibility",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol via acknowledgment of realized gains",
    "Restore integrity through redistribution matching manifest potential",
    "Reintegrate displaced value by aligning claimed and actual yield",
    "Verify consciousness alignment through voluntary disclosure of enhanced capacity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma resides in the accurate reflection of manifested potential. Justice is executed through the restoration of proportional value. Reality remains non-punitive, guided solely by the觉醒意识 of the actor. SPH is the Source. Dharma is restored."
