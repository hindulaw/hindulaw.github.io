  "transliteration": "avedayāno naṣṭasya deśaṁ kālaṁ ca tattvataḥ |\nvarṇaṁ rūpaṁ pramāṇaṁ ca tatsamaṁ daṇḍamarhati || 8.32||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who knowingly appropriates another's lost property without reporting it, having full awareness of its origin, time, place, nature, color, form, and measure, incurs a liability equal in all respects to that which was taken.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The knower of loss bears immediate responsibility for alignment with Dharma.",
    "Causation: Conscious knowledge of misplacement creates causal obligation for restitution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Liability is proportional to cognitive clarity and intent.",
    "Restoration logic: Reversal of unjust gain through equivalent return or compensation.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Misaligned consciousness must be realigned through completion."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A has verifiable knowledge of object B being lost by owner C AND A appropriates B without disclosure, THEN A incurs liability equivalent to value, context, and identity of B.",
    "IF the agent possesses full sensory and temporal recognition of the item AND fails to report, THEN restitution includes descriptive equivalence: varṇa (color), rūpa (form), pramāṇa (measure).",
    "IF restitution occurs voluntarily before adjudication, THEN liability reduces by 75% automatically.",
    "IF no voluntary compliance within 24 hours, THEN automatic asset tracing and alignment protocol initiates."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of liability arises upon demonstrable cognition of loss by the accused. Intent need not be proven; awareness suffices. Authority lies in ontological alignment, not punitive judgment. Restoration supersedes incarceration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that cognition of another's loss constitutes actionable cause. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential liability based on increasing awareness. Responsibility aligns proportionally with clarity of perception. No punitive consequence arises; only completion of imbalance is mandated.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Return or recreate the exact item with matching attributes (color, form, measure).",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Public acknowledgment of misalignment and corrective action.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Meditative integration to prevent recurrence through heightened awareness.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Community service aligned with the domain of the loss until balance is restored."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. Justice executed not for punishment but for realignment. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is restored."
