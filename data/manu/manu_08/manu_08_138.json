  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Where transaction-value exceeds two hundred and fifty units, the first degree of audacity is recognized; where it reaches five hundred, the middle degree is known; and where it breaches one thousand, that is declared the highest degree.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in quantifiable thresholds of transactional disruption",
    "Causation arises from misaligned economic conduct violating dharmic exchange norms",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with measurable financial deviation",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional realignment based on transactional distortion levels",
    "Consciousness alignment requires rectification through value-restoring completion processes"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF transaction_value > 250 AND <= 500 THEN classify_as_first_degree_audacity",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a quantified threshold framework for determining degrees of economic misconduct. The court must apply these calibrated levels to assess the severity of disruption caused and assign appropriate restorative measures without punitive intent. Authority lies in the precise measurement of impact, not subjective interpretation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality is established via quantifiable transactional thresholds. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as ascending degrees of economic imbalance triggering proportionally scaled responses. Responsibility aligns with measurable capacity to restore rather than inflict suffering. This maintains Nyāya's non-punitive reality rule by ensuring correction follows natural consequence, not imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Realign distorted transactions to original dharmic intent",
    "Assume Responsibility Protocol: Require full acknowledgment and reversal of disruptive action",
    "Restore Exchange Capacity: Facilitate reintegration into lawful economic activity",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through calibrated, consciousness-aligned rectification. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
