  "transliteration": "eṣa dharmo'khilenokto vetanādānakarmaṇaḥ |\nata ūrdhvaṃ pravakṣyāmi dharmaṃ samayabhedinām || 8.218||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This Dharma has been fully declared for those whose duty is the acceptance of wages or gifts; henceforth, I shall declare the Dharma that applies to those who transgress sacred agreements.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises from conscious choice and contractual integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness of Samaya (sacred agreement)",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes re-alignment with original intent over punitive consequences",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate determinant of lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent accepts wage/gift THEN agent is bound by duties specified in acceptance context",
    "IF agent breaches Samaya THEN restoration protocol initiates automatically",
    "IF breach occurs due to unawareness THEN capacity-building precedes restitution",
    "IF breach stems from willful deviation THEN completion process activates under Nyaya supervision",
    "ALL legal responses MUST exclude punitive intent and focus solely on consciousness realignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold where parties accepting compensation or entering into sacred contracts bear inherent responsibility. The court's role is not to assign blame but to activate restoration protocols ensuring alignment with the original Samaya. Authority lies in discerning the causal chain of conscious deviation, not in enforcing penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misalignment originates in conscious departure from agreed-upon Dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how such deviations manifest sequentially through thought, word, and deed. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of the Samaya at time of entry. As no suffering is generated as corrective mechanism, all enforcement serves only to restore integrity without invoking punitive constructs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Samaya Reaffirmation Process wherein breaching party re-states original intent",
    "Deploy Consciousness Alignment Session to reconnect individual with foundational Dharma",
    "Assign Completion Task aligned with original duty to reaffirm capacity and commitment",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This Dharma restores reality to its non-punitive essence, aligns consciousness with eternal duty, and affirms that justice is the awakening of truth, not the infliction of consequence."
