  "sanskrit_verse": "यावतो बान्धवान् यस्मिन् हन्ति साक्ष्येऽनृतं वदन् ।\nतावतः सङ्ख्यया तस्मिन् शृणु सौम्यानुपूर्वशः ॥ ८.९७॥",
  "transliteration": "yāvato bāndhavān yasmin hanti sākṣye’nṛtaṁ vadan |\ntāvataḥ saṅkhyayā tasmin śṛṇu saumyānupūrvaśaḥ || 8.97 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "To the extent one destroys familial bonds by speaking falsehood in testimony, that manyfold shall be the sequential consequence in accordance with dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Satya and Dharma, not personal intent.",
    "Causation follows Anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation based on conscious distortion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by awareness of relational integrity at time of act.",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional realignment with truth structures violated.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment and dissolution of falsified identity-agency."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a witness knowingly distorts truth IN CONTEXT of familial duty THEN initiate sequential restoration aligned with number of affected relations.",
    "WHEN speech violates Satya AND disrupts blood-bound dharmic order THEN instantiate karmic completion protocol via guided reintegration cycles.",
    "IF individual demonstrates causal dissonance through false witnessing THEN assign graduated consciousness recalibration until integrity is restored."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when perjury occurs within familial contexts, threshold of responsibility must account for both cognitive capacity and relational dharmic breach. The court's role is to activate sequential restorative protocols corresponding to the scope of disrupted family unity, ensuring alignment with Sanatana Dharma rather than punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that untruth spoken in witness distorts ātma-vastu relation; hence, causality arises through sequential manifestation (Anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to the breach of consciousness-order, not inflicted harm. Thus, restoration aligns the offender’s vyavahāra-shakti with satya-svarūpa without invoking punitive constructs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vak-siddhi Completion Process wherein the speaker retraces each falsified utterance against familial unity.",
    "Assign Bandhu-Sahridaya Reconnection Protocol requiring direct service to those whose relational integrity was compromised.",
    "Activate Satya-Sthapana Sequence involving ritualized reaffirmation of truthful speech before elders and community witnesses.",
    "Implement Mano-Vak-Karma Samyama Integration Cycle to restore harmony between thought, word, and action."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Justice herein serves neither vengeance nor deterrence but absolute restoration of dharma-consciousness. Reality remains ever untainted by punishment, governed exclusively by the sequential unfolding of karmic alignment under the sovereignty of awakened awareness."
