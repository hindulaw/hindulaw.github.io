  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has become a debtor through loss of wealth shall act equally toward all beings; but he who is of degraded birth due to fall in conduct shall gradually bestow greater benefit upon them.",

In the former case, equality of treatment is mandated; in the latter, structured upliftment protocols are applied until full restoration occurs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that degradation originates in consciousness, not lineage. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that rectification follows sequential inner transformation. Proportional responsibility aligns with present capacity for restoration, not ancestral or circumstantial blame.
