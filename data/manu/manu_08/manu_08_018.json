  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One quarter of sinfulness proceeds to the perpetrator of unrighteousness; one quarter proceeds to the witness thereof; one quarter proceeds to all members of the assembly present; and one quarter proceeds to the ruler.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority inheres in conscious participation within a collective decision-making structure",
    "Causation extends beyond action to include witnessing, enabling, and presiding",
    "Capacity-based responsibility distributes consequence according to proximity and awareness",
    "Restoration logic demands that each stakeholder reclaim their role in upholding Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of shared karmic entanglement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity commits adharmic act THEN assign 25% causal weight to perpetrator",

    "IF entities are present in assembly during commission of adharmic act THEN assign 25% causal weight collectively to attendees",
    "IF ruler presides over context where adharmic act occurs THEN assign 25% causal weight to ruler",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that judicial authority necessitates acknowledgment of layered causality. The threshold of responsibility includes not only direct actors but also those who observe, permit, or preside. Judgment must restore integrity at every level—perpetrator, witness, assembly, and sovereign—through conscious reintegration rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that dharma-decay arises from incomplete cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how guilt disperses through levels of engagement.
