    "Authority originates from the capacity to uphold dharmic integrity in relational dynamics",

The court must evaluate not intent alone but the measurable disruption caused to the natural progression of life-stage transitions. Responsibility lies with the actor who initiates change without alignment to cosmic order. Restoration prevails through calculated recalibration rather than punitive measures.",
