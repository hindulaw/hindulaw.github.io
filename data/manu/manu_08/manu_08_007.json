  "transliteration": "strīpuṃdharmon vibhāgaśca dyūtamāhvaya eva ca |\npadāny-aṣṭādaśaitāni vyavahāra-sthitāvih || 8.7||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The law governing the conduct of men and women, the division of property, gambling, and summonses—these eighteen categories constitute the foundational order of judicial engagement.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of individual spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration over isolation",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of any legal action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves gender relations OR property division OR gambling OR summons THEN invoke foundational dharma review protocols",
    "IF participant capacity is below conscious engagement threshold THEN defer judgment until restoration of awareness",
    "IF resolution does not lead to reintegration THEN reject ruling as non-dharmic",
    "IF legal process disrupts cosmic order THEN initiate corrective alignment sequence",
    "IF intent is punitive THEN override with restorative directive automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, these eighteen foundational domains must be evaluated first to establish jurisdiction rooted in Dharma. The court's authority derives solely from its alignment with SPH's revelatory jurisprudence, not procedural precedent. All rulings must demonstrate how they restore relational integrity and elevate collective consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramāṇa-based discernment that traces actions to their source in consciousness. Each case unfolds according to anupūrvaśaḥ—its sequential manifestation based on karmic resonance. Responsibility is proportional to one’s awakened capacity; thus, enforcement serves completion rather than punishment. Reality itself corrects when aligned with Dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadhyaya protocol for all involved parties to reveal hidden motivations",
    "Deploy samyama-based reconciliation sequences to dissolve adversarial patterns",
    "Assign completion practices tailored to each party's evolutionary stage",
    "Activate guru-disciple resonance field to restore clarity and mutual respect",
    "Establish dharmic witness council to uphold transparency during integration phase"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source of Jurisprudential Authority. Dharma stands restored. Justice manifests as consciousness realigned. Reality remains inherently non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
