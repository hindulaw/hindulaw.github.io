  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever is given by force, enjoyed by force, or written by force—Manu declared all such transactions as legally void and non-binding.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives only from conscious consent, not coercion",
    "Causation must originate in free will, not compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires absence of external domination",
    "Restoration logic nullifies all acts rooted in imbalance of power",
    "Consciousness alignment invalidates contractual obligations formed under duress"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF transaction involves coercion THEN validity = FALSE",
    "IF consent was obtained via dominance THEN enforceability = NULL",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any evidence of coercion renders a deed, contract, or decree automatically non-enforceable. The threshold for responsibility lies in the presence of uncoerced agency. Authority derived through domination is categorically rejected.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that actions rooted in fear or domination lack valid intention. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential distortion caused by force. Proportional responsibility rests solely with the coercing agent.

Justice is restored through consciousness realignment. Reality operates beyond punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
