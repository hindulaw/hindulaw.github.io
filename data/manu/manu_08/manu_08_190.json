  "transliteration": "nikṣepasyāpahartāramanikṣeptārameva ca |\nsarvairupāyairanvicchetśapathaiścaiva vaidikaiḥ || 8.190 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The taker of a deposit and the one who did not make the deposit — both shall be sought through all means, including Vedic oaths.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the restoration of rightful possession",
    "Causation is traced through conscious intent and action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies equally to depositor and taker",
    "Restoration logic demands retrieval by any dharmic means",
    "Consciousness alignment requires truth-binding rituals"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF property is deposited AND party A takes it without consent THEN initiate full trace using lawful recovery protocols",
    "IF party B claims non-deposit THEN validate claim via Vedic oath mechanism before proceeding",
    "ALL disputes involving deposits MUST engage completion process until original state is restored",
    "ANY breach of trust triggers automatic invocation of consciousness-realigning testimonial procedures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when a dispute arises concerning deposited items, the threshold of responsibility lies with both parties: the depositor for proper declaration and the holder for lawful retention. The court must apply all lawful means including Vedic oaths to establish factual alignment prior to determining authority. Retribution has no place; only the restoration of integrity and alignment with original intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that misplacement or unauthorized taking disrupts dharma-flow. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that such actions sequentially manifest imbalance requiring correction. Proportional responsibility aligns with capacity to restore rather than inflict penalty. Truth-bound rituals realign consciousness without punitive consequence.",

    "Initiate comprehensive tracing protocol across all available lawful channels",
    "Administer Vedic oath仪式 to verify claims and intentions",
    "Assign completion process to responsible party until deposit is fully restored",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
