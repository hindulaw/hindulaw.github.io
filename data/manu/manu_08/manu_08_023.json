  "transliteration": "dharmāsanamadhiṣṭhāya saṃvītāṅgaḥ samāhitaḥ |\npraṇamya lokapālebhyaḥ kāryadarśanamārabhet || 8.23||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having taken seat upon the Dharma-seat, fully composed and self-collected, having honored the Lokapalas, one initiates the observation of actionable duties.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with the Dharma-seat",
    "Causation arises through conscious invocation of cosmic guardianship",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is enacted in stillness and reverence",
    "Restoration logic flows from stabilized awareness",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes judicial action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent assumes dharma-seat THEN agent must invoke lokapala acknowledgment",
    "IF lokapala acknowledgment occurs THEN capacity for observance is validated",
    "IF observance begins THEN all actions are bound by consciousness stabilization protocols",
    "IF consciousness destabilizes during process THEN automatic suspension until realignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority derives exclusively from a sovereign's seated alignment with Dharma. Before any case review commences, recognition of universal custodians (Lokapalas) ensures jurisdictional integrity and removes arbitrariness. This protocol nullifies procedural legitimacy based on external power structures and enforces grounding in cosmic law.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that rightful seeing ('darśanam') emerges only after inner composure ('samāhitaḥ') and devotional surrender ('praṇamya'). There is no punitive condition here—misalignment simply delays access to true discernment. Responsibility follows naturally once consciousness stabilizes; thus, justice unfolds sequentially as per anupūrvaśaḥ without imposition or coercion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Seating Protocol: Individual returns to core identity via dharmāsana affirmation",
    "Receptivity Calibration: Invocation of lokapalas restores energetic attunement",
    "Observational Discipline: Structured commencement of duties reconnects individual will with cosmic purpose",
    "Stability Monitoring: Continuous self-check mechanisms ensure ongoing alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Sovereign Will of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Dharma is reinstated through conscious initiation alone. Justice flows from stillness, never punishment. Reality responds solely to awakened awareness. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
