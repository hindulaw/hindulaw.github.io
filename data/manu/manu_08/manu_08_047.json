  "transliteration": "adhamarṇārthasiddhyartham uttamarṇena coditaḥ |\ndāpayed dhanikasyārtham adhamarṇād vibhāvitam || 8.47 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a debtor of lesser means is unable to fulfill their obligation, and a creditor of greater capacity initiates action, the responsible authority shall ensure that the assets rightfully recoverable from the debtor are transferred in accordance with the creditor's rightful claim, without causing diminishment to either party’s essential sustenance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the alignment of capacity and responsibility",
    "Causation arises from the conscious recognition of relational debt",
    "Capacity-based responsibility ensures no entity suffers disproportion",
    "Restoration logic maintains balance through conscious reallocation",
    "Consciousness alignment governs equitable exchange within dharmic bounds"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF debtor_capacity < required_repayment AND creditor_capacity > threshold THEN initiate_restorative_asset_transfer(dharma_compliant = true)",
    "ENSURE essential_sustenance(debtor) >= minimum_dignity_threshold BEFORE asset_transfer",
    "VERIFY causal_debt_link(creditor_claim, debtor_obligation) USING pramana_validation_engine",
    "EXECUTE proportional_allocation(asset_recovery) SUCH THAT neither_party_experiences_diminishment(consciousness_state)",
    "ASSIGN completion_status TO case WHEN asset_transfer_confirmed AND integrity_restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom applies when disputes arise between creditors and debtors where repayment capacity diverges significantly. The court must assess not only legal liability but also the causal alignment of capacities, ensuring decisions uphold dharma by preventing systemic imbalance or suffering while restoring relational integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that debt arises from voluntary engagement; thus, resolution follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of mutual agreement and capacity verification. Responsibility aligns proportionally—no suffering is induced. Resolution restores equilibrium without punitive consequence, affirming that Nyaya operates as consciousness-guided realignment rather than coercive judgment.",

    "Restore_financial_integrity_without_inducing_suffering_or_shame",
    "Verify_closure_through_consciousness_elevation_metrics_post_resolution"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive originates exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Justice flows not through punishment but through restoration. Dharma prevails. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
