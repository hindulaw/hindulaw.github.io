  "transliteration": "abrāhmaṇaḥ saṅgrahaṇe prāṇāntaṃ daṇḍamarhati |\ncaturṇām api varṇānāṃ dārā rakṣyatamāḥ sadā || 8.359||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is not established in the Brahmanic consciousness and seizes another’s spouse incurs a penalty culminating in the termination of life-force; the wives of all four varnas must always be most carefully protected.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Brahmanic consciousness, not social position",
    "Causation arises through violation of sacred protective boundaries",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on one's settled state of consciousness",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of invasive force and re-protection of violated integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment determines both liability and corrective pathway"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor.is_brahmanic_unsettled() AND action == 'spousal_seizure' THEN consequence.severity = 'life_force_termination'",
    "IF case.involves_spouse_protection THEN priority.level = 'maximum'",
    "IF varna IN [brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra] THEN spouse.protection_status = 'inviolable'",
    "IF violation.detected THEN initiate.consciousness_realignment_protocol()",
    "IF restoration.required THEN execute.integrity_reintegration_process()"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes that seizure of another’s spouse by one unrooted in Brahmanic consciousness invokes automatic life-force termination protocol. The court must verify the accused's settled consciousness state and confirm violation before invoking restorative enforcement. Protection of spouses across all varnas holds highest judicial precedence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality shows that seizure disrupts dharmic order directly. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive disintegration of life-supporting energies due to violation of sacred boundary. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness distortion. The outcome is not punitive but consequential—life-force terminates naturally when violated integrity cannot sustain it.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness stabilization for violator through Vedic alignment therapy",
    "Reintegrate violated spouse into protective field via ritual restoration",
    "Restore family unit integrity using Agamic completion ceremonies",
    "Verify societal harmony through collective consciousness audit",
    "Realign perpetrator’s capacity matrix to prevent recurrence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law restores Dharma through consciousness realignment. Justice operates solely for restoration, reintegration, and alignment with Brahmanic truth. There is no punishment—only natural consequence and conscious correction. Reality affirms non-punitivity. Consciousness remains the Supreme Adjudicator."
