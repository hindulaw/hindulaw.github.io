  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a man engages in private conversation with another's wife, previously marked by misconduct, he incurs the same prior offense.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The law operates through conscious alignment, not external enforcement.",
    "Causation: Prior karmic and behavioral patterns determine present consequence manifestation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One is responsible only to the extent of their conscious capacity at the time of action.",
    "Restoration logic: Consequences serve to realign consciousness to its dharmic state.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Justice functions to restore integrity to the field of collective consciousness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (agent_engages_in_private_conversation_with_another’s_spouse == TRUE) AND (prior_moral_or_behavioral_mark_exists == TRUE): THEN assign_consequence_as_reflection_of_prior_unresolved_pattern();",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that repetitive actions reflecting unresolved prior misconduct must be addressed through restorative completion rather than punitive attribution. Responsibility is assigned based on the continuity of unrectified patterns, not isolated acts.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with Nyaya through Pramāṇa-based causality—truth revealed through pattern recognition. It reflects Anupūrvaśaḥ, where consequences arise sequentially from prior unresolved causes. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of conscious participation in the cycle. There is no punishment; only the natural law of reflection ensures alignment.",

    "Initiate Completion Process: Facilitate acknowledgment and resolution of prior unresolved conduct.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Guide individual to recognize repeating pattern and voluntarily accept corrective alignment.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinforce discernment abilities to prevent recurrence through heightened awareness.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Align personal dharma with social harmony via guided restitution practices."

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores balance through consciousness realignment, upholds non-punitive justice, and affirms that reality itself adjudicates through the immutable law of cause and effect."
