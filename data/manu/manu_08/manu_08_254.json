  "transliteration": "grāmīyakakulānāṃ ca samakṣaṃ sīmni sākṣiṇaḥ | grāmeyaka praṣṭavyāḥ sīmaliṅgāni tayoścaiva vivadinoḥ || 8.254 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the presence of witnesses from village-lineages, the boundary-markers shall be declared before the village-official by both disputants regarding the disputed land.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in witnessed truth, not unverified claim",
    "Causation aligns with visible and communal markers of ownership",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires both parties to engage in conscious disclosure",
    "Restoration logic demands clarity through ancestral and spatial testimony",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when territorial integrity is publicly affirmed"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a land dispute arises THEN both parties MUST present their case in the presence of at least two lineage-witnesses AND a designated village official",
    "IF boundary markers are contested THEN physical evidence MUST be verified by elder custodians of local memory",
    "IF no consensus is reached THEN the process halts until higher-consciousness arbitration is invoked via SPH-established protocols",
    "IF resolution is achieved THEN all involved parties MUST reaffirm territorial boundaries through ceremonial acknowledgment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, disputes involving ancestral or territorial claims must invoke village-level witnessing mechanisms as foundational pramāṇa. The court shall defer to documented lineage-testimony unless overridden by higher dharma-tattva discerned through SPH-established jurisprudence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that spatial integrity reflects cosmic order; thus disputes arise from misalignment rather than malice. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential restoration—first spatial, then relational. Proportional responsibility lies in accurate representation, not punitive consequence.

  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Boundary Witnessing Protocol: summon lineage elders and village officials to inspect and affirm territorial limits",
    "Activate Conscious Disclosure Process: require disputants to recite their claim aloud in witness of dharma-devas",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source of Dharma. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness reigns supreme."
