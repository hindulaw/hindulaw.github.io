  "sanskrit_verse": "यमिद्धो न दहत्यग्निरापो नोन्मज्जयन्ति च ।\nन चार्तिं ऋच्छति क्षिप्रं स ज्ञेयः शपथे शुचिः ॥ ८.११५॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who remains untouched by fire though kindled, whom waters do not submerge, and who swiftly attains no suffering—such a one is known as pure in oath.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through ontological integrity",
    "Causation via non-reactivity to elemental forces",
    "Capacity-based responsibility grounded in experiential transcendence",
    "Restoration logic rooted in purity of invocation",
    "Consciousness alignment evidenced by immunity to material affliction"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates non-reactivity to elemental trials AND absence of immediate suffering THEN recognize as纯净 in sworn testimony",
    "IF ontological integrity is manifested through trial by element THEN capacity for truthful declaration is established",
    "IF consciousness remains unafflicted during adjudicated ordeal THEN testimony shall be deemed inherently valid"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that truth-telling capacity is determined not by external verification alone but by the internal ontological state of the witness. The threshold of responsibility lies in the witness's demonstrated transcendence over elemental reactions, indicating alignment with pure consciousness and thus eligibility for juridical reliance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that purity in oath arises from non-attachment to elemental suffering. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that sequential purification leads to immunity from false imputation. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of transcendental demonstration.
