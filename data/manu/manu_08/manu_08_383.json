  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brāhmaṇa transgressing secrecy in sexual union with a Śūdrā woman shall incur a thousandfold penalty; likewise, a Kṣatriya or Vaiśya engaging secretly with a Śūdrā woman shall bear a thousandfold restraint.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rooted in varṇic integrity and consciousness capacity",
    "Causation through violation of dharmic relational boundaries",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by varṇic role and spiritual station",
    "Restoration logic grounded in purification of relational transgression",
    "Consciousness alignment via reintegration into dharmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = Brāhmaṇa AND act = sexual union with Śūdrā woman AND condition = secrecy THEN penalty = 1000x base measure",
    "IF actor = Kṣatriya OR Vaiśya AND act = sexual union with Śūdrā woman AND condition = secrecy THEN restraint = 1000x base measure",
    "IF violation occurs THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol aligned to varṇic svadharma",
    "IF transgression involves secrecy THEN escalation factor = 1000x due to concealment violating transparency dharma"

Violations involving secrecy invoke higher scalar penalties due to erosion of transparency dharma. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated by svadharma capacity, not punitive equivalence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that secrecy disrupts societal dharmic flow. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as proportional energetic misalignment requiring conscious restoration而非 suffering infliction. Penalty scales reflect consciousness distortion magnitude, not punitive intent.",

    "Initiate purification completion process for violator until alignment with svadharma restored",
