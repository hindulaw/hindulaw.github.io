  "transliteration": "dāsyaṁ tu kārayan lobhād brāhmaṇaḥ saṁskṛtān dvijān |\nanicchataḥ prābhavaty ād rājñā daṇḍyaḥ śatāni ṣaṭ || 8.412 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Brāhmaṇa, motivated by greed, causes enslaved labor upon initiated dvijas who are unwilling and oppressed thereby, the king shall impose a penalty of six hundred.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The king holds executive capacity to enforce alignment with Dharma.",
    "Causation: Greed is the root cause that distorts rightful action and generates injustice.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: A Brāhmaṇa, due to spiritual authority, bears greater alignment duty.",
    "Restoration logic: Penalty serves not as retribution but as correction of distorted consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Enforced restitution realigns actor with dharmic capacity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = Brāhmaṇa AND motive = greed AND action = forced labor on unwilling initiated dvijas THEN enforce corrective financial restitution of six hundred units.",

    "IF authority misused for exploitation THEN automatic suspension of exploitative capacity until realignment verified."

The court enforces restoration protocols ensuring the offending party completes corrective actions under judicial supervision.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals greed as the causal distortion leading to exploitation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misaligned intent manifests in unlawful act. Responsibility is proportional to capacity; hence, correction aligns actor with inherent dharma without punitive infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Offender must perform acts that reverse effects of exploitation.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Public acknowledgment and redress of harm caused.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Mandatory engagement in dharmic education and service to restore integrity.",
