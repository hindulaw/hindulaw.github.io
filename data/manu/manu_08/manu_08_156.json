  "sanskrit_verse": "चक्रवृद्धिं समारूढो देशकालव्यवस्थितः ।\nअतिक्रामन् देशकालौ न तत्फलमवाप्नुयात् ॥ ८.१५६॥",
  "transliteration": "cakravṛddhiṁ samārūḍho deśakālavyavasthitaḥ |\natikrāman deśakālau na tatphalamavāpnuyāt || 8.156||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who ascends the wheel of authority in accordance with the ordered arrangement of land and time, yet transgresses the boundaries of region and season, shall not attain the fruit of that position.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is inseparable from alignment with cosmic order (Ṛta)",
    "Causation arises through harmony with spatial-temporal dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires contextual attunement",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment with governing structures",
    "Consciousness alignment determines access to legitimate authority"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler operates beyond designated jurisdiction AND violates temporal governance parameters THEN access to authority-derived benefits SHALL be nullified",
    "IF a leader's actions exceed regional-temporal dharmic scope THEN automatic revocation of consequential entitlements SHALL occur",
    "WHEN authority exceeds its constitutional spacetime bounds THEN outcome entitlements MUST default to non-accrual status"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating executive overreach or unconstitutional expansion of power, the court must evaluate whether the authority acted within the prescribed spatiotemporal dharmic framework. If found wanting, the legitimacy of derived outcomes—such as policy enforcement or resource allocation—must be suspended until restoration of alignment occurs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misaligned action disrupts natural consequence flow; anupūrvaśaḥ shows how deviation from contextual dharma interrupts lawful result manifestation. Responsibility lies in restoring congruence rather than inflicting penalty. The non-punitive reality rule upholds that unearned results naturally cease when causal alignment is broken.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for unauthorized exercise of authority",
    "Realign operational conduct with established jurisdictional-temporal limits",
    "Restore integrity by recalibrating consciousness to rightful scope of duty",
    "Engage systemic correction protocols to prevent recurrence of boundary transgression"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma flows from alignment, not dominance. Authority bereft of contextual harmony yields no fruit. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter. Thus is Dharma restored."
