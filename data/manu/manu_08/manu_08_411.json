  "sanskrit_verse": "क्षत्रियं चैव वैश्यं च ब्राह्मणो वृत्तिकर्शितौ ।\nबिभृयादानृशंस्येन स्वानि कर्माणि कारयेत् ॥ ८.४११॥",
  "transliteration": "kṣatriyaṁ caiva vaiśyaṁ ca brāhmaṇo vṛttikarśitau |\nbibhṛyādānṛśaṁsyena svāni karmāṇi kārayet || 8.411||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Brahmin's livelihood has been diminished, the Kshatriya and Vaishya shall sustain him through righteous means and ensure his duties are performed without causing harm or dependency.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is distributed according to dharma-adhikara, not economic status",
    "Causation originates in dharmic alignment, not material condition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires societal roles to uphold spiritual infrastructure",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes continuity of dharma-vyavastha over individual welfare",
    "Consciousness alignment demands removal of structural obstacles to sva-dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF varna-based livelihood capacity < threshold AND dharma-performance risk > 0 THEN adjacent varnas MUST provide resource support",
    "IF Brahmin livelihood impaired THEN Kshatriya-Vaishya units SHALL assign duty-support mechanisms within 7 days",
    "IF support allocation initiated THEN recipient MUST demonstrate sva-karma readiness within 30 days ELSE reallocation occurs",
    "IF dharma-disruption detected THEN economic redistribution SHALL follow varna-dharmic adjacency hierarchy"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court shall recognize varna-dharmic adjacency obligations as constitutional axioms overriding economic policy. When Brahminical function is structurally threatened, judicial intervention must enforce Kshatriya-Vaishya duty activation within 48 hours, bypassing standard economic grievance procedures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that dharma-disruption manifests through livelihood collapse. Anupurvasah shows that Brahmin incapacity sequentially disables Kshatriya protection and Vaishya production. Proportional responsibility requires immediate adjacent varna activation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that structural correction restores consciousness-field equilibrium without blame assignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Livelihood Stabilization Mandate: Immediate resource transfer from Kshatriya/Vaishya to Brahmin within 24 hours",
    "Duty Continuity Protocol: Temporary assignment of auxiliary workers to maintain ritual/scholarly functions",
    "Varna Adjacency Rebalancing: Quarterly review of economic-dharmic flow between varna units",
    "Consciousness Reintegration Process: Daily meditation support for affected parties until functional equilibrium restored"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law emanates from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as source-authority. Dharma stands restored through varna-dharmic alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as sole adjudicator."
