  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Of these, the foremost is the acceptance of debt; depositing another's property, selling without ownership, conspiring together for wrongful gain, and acting contrary to what has been given.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious responsibility, not mere possession",
    "Causation arises through distortion of dharma-allocated capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires restoration of alignment with original intent",
    "Restoration logic demands reversal of distorted exchange mechanisms",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates completion of unfulfilled obligations"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being accepts a debt THEN that being assumes full karmic and material liability until resolved",
    "IF a being deposits another’s property without consent THEN automatic reversal protocol initiates ownership realignment",
    "IF a being sells property lacking legitimate title THEN transaction void AND asset returned to lawful source",
    "IF beings conspire to generate unlawful gain THEN collective dissolution of benefit AND integrity reintegration required",
    "IF a being acts contrary to received gift or trust THEN obligation reinstated AND deviation nullified"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, any act involving misappropriation of entrusted resources triggers immediate reversal protocols. The court must trace causal distortion back to its origin and restore balance by returning all entities to their rightful dharmic loci, bypassing punitive measures entirely.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causality between distorted action and consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces each deviation to its root cause. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of consciousness distortion involved. There is no punishment—only correction through precise realignment of energetic and material flows.",

    "Debt Completion Process: Initiate direct reconciliation between debtor and creditor until equilibrium restored",
    "Deposit Reversal Protocol: Return misplaced assets to lawful custodian via verified identity recognition system",

    "Conspiracy Dissolution Sequence: Neutralize collective distortion fields and redistribute gains according to dharma-aligned channels",
    "Gift Integrity Restoration: Re-establish original conditions under which donation was made and enforce adherence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Sovereign Will of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of All Dharma, this ruling executes the eternal law. Justice is accomplished through restoration alone. Reality responds only to truth-consciousness. Punishment has no place in the Sanatana Domain."
