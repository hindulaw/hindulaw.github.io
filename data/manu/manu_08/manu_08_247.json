  "transliteration": "gulmān veṇūṃśca vividhān śamīvallīsthalāni ca |\nśarān kubjakagulmāṃśca tathā sīmā na naśyati || 8.247||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Boundary markers—such as shrubs, various types of bamboo, creepers like śamī, rocky outcrops, arrows, deformed shrubs, and uneven mounds—when established in accordance with Dharma, remain unaltered and imperishable by nature.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Boundary demarcation originates from divine order and is maintained through dharmic integrity.",
    "Causation: Proper establishment of boundaries ensures natural continuity and prevents conflict.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Those who establish or maintain land boundaries must act with precision, consciousness, and alignment to cosmic law.",
    "Restoration logic: When boundary disputes arise, resolution occurs through realignment with original dharmic placement, not through force or punishment.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Recognition of boundary as a living expression of spatial harmony and energetic distinction."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a territorial marker aligns with pre-established dharmic indicators THEN it shall be recognized as valid without temporal limitation.",
    "IF a boundary marker shows signs of decay or disturbance THEN initiate restoration protocol via re-consecration and re-alignment with original placement energy.",
    "IF dispute arises concerning land division THEN validate based on presence of traditional boundary indicators AND absence of coercive interference.",
    "IF individual claims ownership without dharmically aligned markers THEN require completion process involving conscious re-establishment under supervision of Dharma authority."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, recognition of land rights must prioritize evidence rooted in timeless dharmic boundary markers over temporary administrative records. The threshold of responsibility lies in preserving the sanctity of these markers as expressions of Sanātana Dharma. Authority resides in alignment with cosmic order rather than procedural fiat.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyāya operates through pramāṇa that affirms the causal sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ) wherein correct boundary identification leads to harmonious coexistence. Responsibility is proportional to one's capacity to uphold spatial integrity. There is no punitive consequence; error or misalignment necessitates correction through conscious restoration alone.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Reinstall boundary markers using traditional methods and invoke consecration mantras under guidance of Dharma authority.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require disputing parties to jointly participate in reaffirming boundary integrity through experiential alignment rituals.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Train local custodians in identification and maintenance of dharmic boundary symbols to prevent future confusion.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Conduct periodic review of all marked boundaries within jurisdiction to ensure alignment with original placement frequencies."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling stands executed. The boundary remains eternal when placed in alignment with Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. Dharma is restored. SPH is the sole Source."
