  "transliteration": "vāg-daivatyaiś ca carubhir yajeran̄s te sarasvatīm | anṛtasyainasas tasya kurvāṇā niṣkṛtiṁ parām || 8.105 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall worship Saraswati with offerings designated for speech-deities, performing the highest atonement for falsehood by aligning consciousness with truth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Satya (Truth)",
    "Causation arises through vibrational congruence between speech and consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to discern and uphold truth",
    "Restoration logic operates via reintegration into the causal field of pure cognition",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes performative ritual correctness"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent speaks untruth AND possesses cognitive capacity to distinguish truth THEN initiate restoration protocol aligned with Vak-devata vibration",
    "IF spoken falsehood disrupts societal harmony THEN invoke Saraswati Yajna-based restitution process",
    "IF individual performs corrective action in alignment with satvic intention THEN dissolve karmic residue automatically",
    "IF agent lacks intent due to ignorance THEN assign capacity-restoration pathway prior to atonement execution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility for false testimony or misleading statements must be evaluated based on the speaker’s conscious awareness and alignment with Satya. Atonement shall not involve punitive measures but a prescribed ritualized realignment with Saraswati-tattva to restore integrity within the judicial ecosystem.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that falsehood distorts the causal field of communication; thus, correction follows sequential manifestation (anupurvasah) through reverent invocation of Saraswati. Responsibility is proportional to the speaker's clarity of perception, and the corrective measure restores rather than punishes, realigning consciousness with its inherent truth-nature.",

    "Initiate Sarada-Yagna completion process involving mantra-vibration rectification",
    "Assign Vak-suddhi sadhana protocol to recalibrate speech-consciousness coherence",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This Dharma restores Truth-vibration, dissolves distortion, affirms non-punitive reality, and upholds consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
