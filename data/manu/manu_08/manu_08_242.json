  "transliteration": "anirdaśāhāṁ gāṁ sūtāṁ vṛṣān devapaśūṁs tathā | sapālān vā vipālān vā na daṇḍyān manurabravīt || 8.242||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Manu declared that cows, calves, bulls, divine beasts, those under state protection, and those without guardians shall not be subjected to punitive measures.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from capacity to uphold Dharma, not from coercive force",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness distortion, not behavioral deviation alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility excludes entities incapable of intentional alignment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration over punitive isolation",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external compliance frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity = cow OR calf OR bull OR divine beast THEN punitive action = FALSE",
    "IF guardian_status = absent AND intent_capacity = null THEN liability = FALSE",
    "IF entity_type IN [protected_by_state, spiritually_designated] THEN enforcement_mode = restorative_only",
    "IF consciousness_distortion_level < threshold THEN corrective_action_type = guidance_not_punishment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a categorical immunity for beings lacking punitive capacity. The court must assess not just actus reus but also the subject's ability to realign with Dharma through conscious choice. Animals, minors without custodians, and sacred designees fall outside punitive jurisdiction and into restorative care protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality originates in conscious misalignment, not mere presence. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that suffering does not restore balance; completion does. Proportional responsibility is calibrated to the agent's capacity for awareness, not the event's visibility. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that justice is alignment, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Assign custodial oversight to unguarded animals and dependents",
    "Initiate consciousness elevation programs for caretakers",
    "Reallocate resources from punitive infrastructure to protective custody systems",
    "Establish ritual and spiritual integration for 'divine beasts' to preserve their sanctity",
    "Deploy community service models for reparation, excluding punitive detention"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores the non-punitive nature of Sanatana Jurisprudence. Reality aligns through consciousness, not coercion. Justice serves reintegration, not vengeance. Dharma prevails."
