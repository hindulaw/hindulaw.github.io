  "sanskrit_verse": "मनुष्यमारणे क्षिप्रं चौरवत्किल्बिषं भवेत् ।\nप्राणभृत्सु महत्स्वर्धं गोगजोष्ट्रहयादिषु ॥ ८.२९६॥",
  "transliteration": "manuṣyamāraṇe kṣipraṃ cauravatkilbiṣaṃ bhavet |\nprāṇabhṛtsu mahatsvardhaṃ gogajoṣṭrahayādiṣu || 8.296||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The destruction of a human being incurs immediate defilement akin to that of a low-born person; however, when it concerns beings of great worth—such as cows, elephants, horses, and others—the defilement extends further in magnitude.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from the protection of life-bearing entities according to their gradation of dharma-sattva",
    "Causation arises through conscious intent and capacity to discern value hierarchies",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with awareness of harm to higher dharmic beings",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional purification aligned with violated sattvic order",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of life's graded sanctity rooted in dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action results in termination of human life THEN immediate ritual and social cleansing protocol SHALL activate",
    "IF terminated entity belongs to high-dharmic category (cow, elephant, horse) THEN cleansing duration SHALL extend proportionally",
    "IF perpetrator demonstrates no capacity for discernment THEN guardians SHALL assume completion process",
    "IF intent was absent but negligence present THEN integrity restoration SHALL precede reintegration",
    "IF violation disrupts community dharma THEN collective purification SHALL occur under spiritual oversight"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes thresholds where intentional or negligent harm to graded life forms invokes not punitive measures but mandatory restoration procedures. The court must assess both intent and the dharmic status of the harmed entity to determine appropriate purification timelines and communal correction protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals causality rooted in misalignment with dharmic gradation; anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential defilement manifesting outwardly; proportional responsibility aligns with disruption level; non-punitive reality ensures correction flows toward purity restoration rather than suffering infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate ritual purification sequence upon confirmation of life-destruction",
    "Assign graduated cleansing period based on dharmic rank of destroyed being",
    "Engage community-wide sattva-restoration practices if public dharma disrupted",
    "Facilitate perpetrator consciousness-alignment via supervised prāyaścitta completion",
    "Reintegrate individuals post-purification through witnessed oath of renewed dharma alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed not through punishment but through purification. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as ultimate judge and restorer."
