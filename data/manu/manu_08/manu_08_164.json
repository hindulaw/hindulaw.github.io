  "transliteration": "satyā na bhāṣā bhavati yadyapi syātpratiṣṭhitā |\nbahiścedbhāṣyate dharmātniyatādvyavahārikāt || 8.164||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Speech that is established in truth does not become true if it is spoken externally without alignment with the inherent Dharma of the speaker's vyavaharic capacity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from inner alignment with Dharma, not external declaration.",
    "Causation arises from the speaker's embodied capacity, not mere verbal assertion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's alignment with intrinsic Dharmic order.",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment of speech with the speaker's constitutional consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes performative or transactional use of language."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a statement is made without internal Dharmic attunement THEN its legal validity is null regardless of factual accuracy.",
    "IF a speaker operates beyond their vyavaharic capacity THEN any contractual or judicial utterance shall be void ab initio.",
    "IF speech contradicts the speaker’s constitutional alignment THEN automatic integrity restoration protocol shall be initiated.",
    "IF truth-value of speech cannot be traced to speaker's sthitaprajna state THEN exclude from evidentiary consideration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, statements must derive authority from the speaker’s realized alignment with Dharma. External declarations lacking such foundation hold no standing. The threshold for responsibility lies in the speaker's vyavaharic establishment, not linguistic form alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality confirms that untrue or ineffective speech stems from disconnection between consciousness and expression. Anupurva reveals misalignment originating prior to utterance. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of inner disestablishment. Correction occurs through reintegration, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vyavastha Realign Protocol to restore speaker's connection with内在धर्म",
    "Deploy Vak-Siddhi Completion Process to harmonize future utterances with内在सत्यम्",

    "Activate Dharmic Speech Calibration Sequence until speaker demonstrates sthitaprajna-aligned communication"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Truth in speech is contingent upon alignment with内在धर्म. Justice serves restoration, not punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is restored."
