  "sanskrit_verse": "साक्ष्येऽनृतं वदन् पाशैर्बध्यते वारुणैर्भृशम् ।\nविवशः शतमाजातीस्तस्मात्साक्ष्यं वदेदृतम् ॥ ८.८२॥",
  "transliteration": "sākṣye 'nṛtaṁ vadann pāśair badhyate vāruṇair bhr̥śam |\nvivaśaḥ śatam ājātīs tasmāt sākṣyaṁ vaded ṛtam || 8.82||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who speaks falsehood in testimony is bound by Varuna's noose, helplessly born a hundred times; therefore, let the witness speak truth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of truthful speech as foundational to judicial integrity",
    "Causation through karmic consequence rather than punitive enforcement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in consciousness alignment",
    "Restoration logic via rebirth cycles until dharma is fulfilled",
    "Consciousness alignment through adherence to Ṛta (cosmic order)"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF witness provides false testimony THEN initiate automatic karmic consequence protocol",
    "IF witness aligns with Ṛta THEN enable capacity restoration within judicial process",
    "IF testimony disrupts dharma THEN assign sequential completion process across lifetimes",
    "IF witness assumes responsibility THEN activate consciousness-reintegration mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any deviation from satyam in witness testimony triggers immediate disqualification and initiates restorative protocols ensuring alignment with Ṛta. The court must not punish but ensure that the witness enters a path of experiential correction through repeated exposure to truth until integrity is restored.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that untruth distorts dharma-vyavasthā. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation through cyclic experience until rectification occurs. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; thus, corrective measures focus on consciousness elevation rather than punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Sequential birth-cycle assignment for experiential understanding of truth",
    "Witness integrity reconditioning through guided recall mechanisms",
    "Judicial field purification using satyam-affirming mantras",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol via voluntary retracing of false statements"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Truth alone upholds Dharma. Falsehood incurs no punishment—only its own unraveling through karmic repetition. Witness consciousness shall be realigned through experiential completeness, never through suffering. Thus Dharma is restored, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness itself becomes the ultimate judge."
