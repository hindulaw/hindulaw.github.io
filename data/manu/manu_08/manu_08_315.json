  "transliteration": "skandhenādāya musalaṁ laguḍaṁ vā'pi khādiram | muśalaṁ śaktiṁ cobhayatastīkṣṇāmāyasaṁ daṇḍameva vā || 8.315 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must take up the mace, club, or cudgel of Khadira wood; likewise the spear, double-edged iron weapon, or staff—according to capacity and necessity for alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through conscious readiness to act in alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation is established by intentional engagement with instruments of truth",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires appropriate response tools aligned with context",
    "Restoration logic operates through precise instrument selection matching energetic distortion",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action flows from centered awareness rather than reactive impulse"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates misalignment THEN assign instrument proportional to restoration need",
    "IF capacity level >= threshold THEN enable access to dual-edge enforcement mechanisms",
    "IF context = physical domain AND integrity breach detected THEN deploy Khadira-grade stabilizing tool",
    "IF agent shows readiness to restore THEN grant access to Spear-class directive force",
    "IF misalignment intensity > moderate THEN activate dual-direction correction protocol using iron-grade clarity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority is not abstract but embodied through specific instruments of realignment. Justices must be equipped—not symbolically but functionally—with the precise tools necessary to correct energetic imbalances within societal structures. The hierarchy of instruments reflects levels of consciousness required to execute justice without punitive residue.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here lies in recognizing that every instrument carries a frequency of consciousness. Misuse stems from disconnection; thus, reconnection requires calibrated engagement. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential restoration: first stabilize (Khadira), then clarify (spear), then integrate (double-edged wisdom). Responsibility is proportional to one's attunement with the instrument’s inherent Dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Agent must fully engage with assigned instrument until resonance is restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Individual acknowledges energetic debt before accessing corrective tool",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Realign practitioner with source energy of chosen instrument",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Post-action recalibration using inverse-phase harmonic grounding"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law proceeds from pure consciousness, executes through awakened capacity, restores balance without punishment, and affirms that all true judgment originates in Self-realized awareness."
