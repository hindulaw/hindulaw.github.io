  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Acceptance of wages without fulfillment of contractual duty and breach of agreement create liability between employer and employee; disputes arising from purchase and sale transactions follow the same principle.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from mutual consent and capacity to fulfill obligation",
    "Causation is established through unmet contractual duty",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by volitional engagement in transaction",
    "Restoration logic requires completion of original contractual intent",
    "Consciousness alignment demands integrity in exchange and service"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a party accepts compensation AND fails to execute agreed duties, THEN that party incurs restorative liability until completion occurs",
    "IF a contract is breached due to willful omission, THEN the breaching party must assume corrective action within 7 days",
    "IF transactional dispute arises, THEN both parties shall undergo capacity verification before proceeding to resolution chamber",
    "IF employment relation exists AND wage is taken, THEN full accountability for role-defined performance is binding"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes threshold responsibility based on voluntary acceptance of benefit with implicit duty. Authority lies in conscious agreement, not coercion. Judgment must prioritize restoration of functional equilibrium over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through documented agreement and wage receipt. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential failure post-compensation. Proportional responsibility aligns with scope of unfulfilled duty. Non-punitive reality rule ensures correction flows from individual's own causal chain.",

    "Assumption Protocol: Breaching party publicly reaffirms commitment to original contract",
