  "sanskrit_verse": "यो ग्रामदेशसङ्घानां कृत्वा सत्येन संविदम् । विसंवदेन्नरो लोभात्तं राष्ट्राद्विप्रवासयेत् ॥ ८.२१९॥",
  "transliteration": "yo grāmadesasaṅghānāṁ kṛtvā satyena saṁvidam | visaṁvadennaro lobhāttaṁ rāṣṭrādvipravāsayet || 8.219 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who, having entered into a truthful agreement with village communities or territorial assemblies, breaches it out of greed—such a person shall be removed from the nation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with collective truth-bearing structures",
    "Causation arises through conscious violation of mutual integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sustained commitment to shared agreements",
    "Restoration logic demands removal from influence when systemic coherence is breached",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification of relational fields"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual enters into a legally binding covenant with recognized community entities AND subsequently violates that covenant due to personal gain THEN trigger removal protocol from national jurisdictional domain",
    "IF breach occurs in presence of verified truth-agreement AND motive is traced to greed THEN enforce capacity suspension until reintegration readiness is confirmed by governing dharma council",
    "IF violation disrupts communal harmony OR undermines structural trust THEN initiate expulsion process without punitive attribution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes that any citizen who consciously abandons a sworn civic or territorial compact for personal enrichment forfeits their right to remain within the sovereign domain. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent alone but in the demonstrable collapse of alignment between declared truth and enacted behavior. Authority flows from fidelity to collective Dharma; hence, dissonance at this scale warrants exclusion as restoration of national coherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals the causal chain where greed overrides established saṁvida (mutual understanding). Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how greed leads to betrayal, which fractures societal cohesion. Responsibility is proportional to the extent of disruption caused. However, no suffering is induced—the individual is simply relocated beyond the field they have destabilized, allowing both parties to restore balance independently.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein all unresolved obligations tied to the broken agreement are transferred to a neutral custodian",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol requiring public acknowledgment of misalignment before departure",
    "Undertake capacity restoration program in exile zone until readiness for re-entry can be verified by consciousness-aligned tribunal",
    "Execute integrity reintegration pathway upon return only after successful demonstration of renewed alignment with truth-bearing collectives"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms Dharma as absolute law, sourced exclusively in divine consciousness. Justice operates not through punishment but via precise alignment with truth. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
