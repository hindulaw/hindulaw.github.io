  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When gold is entrusted under solemn oaths by those who are mature in age and form, and it is subsequently misappropriated through false counsel, then that gold must be returned in truth and totality to its rightful owner.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is established through conscious witnessing and mature intent",
    "Causation arises from deliberate misdirection of entrusted value",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and maturity at time of transaction",
    "Restoration logic demands return of exact quantum of displaced value",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of sacredness in material trust"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a resource is transferred under witnessed commitment AND recipient has reached legal age AND transfer was made with clear intent THEN any deviation via deceptive guidance triggers automatic reversal protocol",
    "IF misappropriation occurs through misleading advice THEN full restitution is executed without condition upon detection",
    "IF maturity indicators (age, form, mental clarity) are present during entrustment THEN capacity for restitution is assumed absolute"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when evidence establishes mature entrustment under witness and subsequent deviation through false counsel, threshold for responsibility is immediately met. Authority flows from witnessed commitment, not institutional mediation. Restoration precedes procedural complexity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies the precise moment of conscious deviation from witnessed commitment. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequential manifestation from clear intent to misplaced trust to misdirection. Proportional responsibility aligns exactly with the quantum of displacement. Non-punitive reality rule ensures correction without infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Immediate identification and return of exact displaced asset",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Offender acknowledges conscious deviation and initiates personal correction",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Realign offender's understanding of sacredness in material trust",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Public witnessing of corrected state to restore systemic harmony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness alignment, not punitive reaction. The gold returns to its origin, reality remains untainted, and Dharma stands restored."
