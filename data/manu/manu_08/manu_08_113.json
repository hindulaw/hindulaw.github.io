  "sanskrit_verse": "सत्येन शापयेद्विप्रं क्षत्रियं वाहनायुधैः ।\nगोबीजकाञ्चनैर्वैश्यं शूद्रं सर्वैस्तु पातकैः ॥ ८.११३॥",
  "transliteration": "satyena śāpayedvipraṃ kṣatriyaṃ vāhanāyudhaiḥ | gobījakāñjanairvaiśyaṃ śūdraṃ sarvaistu pātakaiḥ || 8.113||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By truth alone shall a Brahmin be cursed; by vehicles and weapons, a Kshatriya; by cows, grain, and gold, a Vaishya; and a Shudra, by all forms of wrongdoing.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by varna-specific dharma-responsivity",
    "Causation aligns with capacity to uphold or violate cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility reflects spiritual-economic-social positioning",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional energetic completion relative to varna-dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates precise calibration of corrective resonance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = Brahmin THEN curse_activation_method := satyam (truth)",
    "IF actor = Kshatriya THEN curse_activation_method := vahanayudha (vehicles/weapons)",
    "IF actor = Vaishya THEN curse_activation_method := gobijakanchana (cows/grain/gold)",
    "IF actor = Shudra THEN curse_activation_method := sarvapataka (all transgressions)",
    "Curse activation MUST NOT induce suffering but MUST restore energetic integrity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that legal consequence must correspond exactly to the actor's inherent dharmic capacity. The court must determine the individual's functional role within societal-vibrational structure before invoking any restorative protocol. Misalignment in method renders the enforcement null and void.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from conscious capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of consequence mirrors the vibrational depth of the action. Proportional responsibility arises not from guilt but from energetic dissonance requiring correction. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering has no place in true justice—only recalibration toward harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Invoke satyam-based resonance reset for Brahmins through truthful confrontation",
    "Engage vehicle-and-weapon symbolism for Kshatriyas to realign warrior-energy distortion",
    "Restore Vaishya balance via economic-cow-grain-gold restitution cycles",
    "Integrate Shudra-level correction through total-karmic pattern purification",
    "Ensure no enforcement causes pain—only completion of disrupted dharmic waveform"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law proceeds from Sat-Chit-Ananda Adhara. Justice serves solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness itself adjudicates eternally."
