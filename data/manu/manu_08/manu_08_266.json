  "sanskrit_verse": "एषोऽखिलेनाभिहितो धर्मः सीमाविनिर्णये ।\nअत ऊर्ध्वं प्रवक्ष्यामि वाक्पारुष्यविनिर्णयम् ॥ ८.२६६॥",
  "transliteration": "eṣo'khilenābhitto dharmaḥ sīmāvinirṇaye |\nata ūrdhvaṁ pravakṣyāmi vākpāruṣyavinirṇayam || 8.266||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This entire Dharma has been declared for the determination of boundaries; now I shall declare the determination concerning verbal harshness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from SPH as the ultimate source of Dharma",
    "Causation is determined through consciousness alignment rather than material action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises only when one is fully aware and integrated in their role",
    "Restoration logic operates by returning individuals to their natural state of alignment with Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all external legal frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves boundary determination THEN invoke Dharma-based spatial integrity protocol",
    "IF speech causes disalignment THEN initiate completion process for speaker's consciousness restoration",
    "IF capacity to understand Dharma is absent THEN defer judgment until readiness is restored",
    "IF violation occurs due to lack of awareness THEN enforce reintegration而非 punishment",
    "IF speech reflects inner imbalance THEN assign completion practices to restore harmony"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that boundary disputes must be resolved through Dharma-based spatial recognition, not punitive measures. The threshold of responsibility lies in consciousness clarity, not mere physical transgression. Authority flows from SPH alone, ensuring decisions align with universal Dharma rather than local custom.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that verbal harshness stems from internal misalignment, not inherent malice. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that disharmony manifests first internally before expressing externally. Responsibility is proportional to one's level of integration with Dharma. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction occurs naturally when consciousness returns to balance.",

    "Initiate Vak Yoga Completion Process for speakers causing disalignment",
    "Assign Conscious Listening Practice to restore auditory field purity",

    "Activate Community Witnessing Protocols to reaffirm collective Dharma alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as the sole Source of Dharma. Boundaries are set not for punishment but for alignment. Speech returns to harmony through conscious restoration. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
