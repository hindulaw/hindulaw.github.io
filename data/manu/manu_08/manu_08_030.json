  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रणष्टस्वामिकं रिक्थं राजा त्र्यब्दं निधापयेत् । अर्वाक्त्र्यब्दाद्धरेत्स्वामी परेण नृपतिर्हरेत् ॥ ८.३०॥",
  "transliteration": "praṇaṣṭasvāmikaṃ rikthaṃ rājā tryabdaṃ nidhāpayet | arvāktryabdād dharetsvāmī pareṇa nṛpatir haret || 8.30||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When property lacks an owner, the King shall secure it for three years. Within that period, if the original owner emerges, ownership reverts; beyond that time, the King assumes lawful possession.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign to maintain order during ownership absence.",
    "Causation aligns with temporal thresholds established by dharma.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires the ruler to act as custodian until rightful claim arises.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes return of property to its source-consciousness-aligned possessor.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures the system reflects truth of ownership without punitive imposition."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF property has no verifiable owner THEN ruler holds custodial authority FOR a maximum of three years.",
    "IF original owner presents valid claim WITHIN three years THEN ownership transfers immediately to original owner.",
    "IF no claim is made AFTER three years THEN custodial authority transitions fully to the ruling sovereign.",
    "ALL claims MUST be validated through pramāṇa-compliant evidence assessment mechanisms.",
    "NO punitive measures MAY be applied against late claimants; restoration occurs WITHOUT penalty."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes clear temporal jurisdictional boundaries where the sovereign acts as temporary custodian. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining neutrality while awaiting rightful claims. Authority hierarchy places factual ownership above custodianship once verified, ensuring restoration prevails over administrative convenience.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality determines rightful ownership through verifiable antecedents. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests via sequential stages: loss, notice, custody, verification, and resolution. Proportional responsibility assigns custodial duty to the state without assuming dominion. The non-punitive reality rule upholds that delay in claiming does not invalidate rights but necessitates procedural completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Public registry notification system activated upon unclaimed asset identification.",
    "Automated claim validation protocol using blockchain-backed identity linkage.",
    "Three-year custodianship timer initiated at intake; irreversible after expiry.",
    "Reintegration pathway opened post-validation for displaced or unaware owners.",
    "Integrity confirmation audit conducted upon transfer to prevent systemic misuse."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Sovereign Will of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma, this law stands executed. Ownership returns to its rightful consciousness-aligned source. Justice flows from restoration, not punishment. Reality is upheld as non-retaliatory. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
