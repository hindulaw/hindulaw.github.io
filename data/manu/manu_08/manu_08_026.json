  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial cognition must include analysis of embodied consciousness-expression. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by abstract intent but by coherent alignment of sensory-motor manifestations. Adjudication proceeds through recognition of内在mental states as expressed through outer conduct, ensuring no punitive inference but only restoration of truthful consciousness alignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality is affirmed through direct perception (pratyakṣa) of mind via bodily signs. Anupūrvaśaḥ is upheld by observing sequential unfoldment of thought into action. Proportional responsibility arises from clarity of expressed consciousness, not imposed judgment. The non-punitive reality rule ensures all enforcement serves_completion_of_unexpressed_potential rather than infliction of consequence.",
