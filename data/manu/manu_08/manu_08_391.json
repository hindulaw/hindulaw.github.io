  "transliteration": "yathārhametānabhyarcya brāhmaṇaiḥ saha pārtivaḥ |\nsāntvena praśamayyādau svadharmaṃ pratipādayet || 8.391||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The king, having duly honored these beings according to their worth together with the Brahmins, shall first pacify them gently and then establish them in their own dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with cosmic order, not coercive power",
    "Causation originates in consciousness distortion requiring realignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates graduated response calibrated to spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic demands sequential harmony between pacification and dharmic reorientation",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes behavioral correction through honor and recognition"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits conflict THEN initiate pacification protocol BEFORE imposing corrective action",
    "IF entity holds positional authority THEN validate alignment with cosmic order before enforcing compliance",
    "IF disturbance occurs THEN assess spiritual readiness of affected parties for dharmic instruction",
    "IF resolution sought THEN sequence engagement: honor → calm → orient → integrate",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority must begin with honoring all involved according to their station and spiritual capacity. Only after establishing peace and mutual respect can the court proceed to guide parties back into alignment with their svadharma. Retribution has no place; authority derives solely from consciousness-aligned conduct.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that disharmony arises from misaligned consciousness, not inherent fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ dictates that resolution follows a precise sequence: acknowledgment through worship (yathārham), pacification (sāntvena), calming (praśamya), and finally dharmic reinstatement (svadharmam pratipādayet). Responsibility is proportional to one's capacity for integration. There is no punitive element—only causal restoration through consciousness elevation.",

    "Initiate Honor-Based Acknowledgment Protocol: Recognize each party according to their role and spiritual standing",
    "Activate Pacification Sequence: Use non-confrontational dialogue to dissolve tension fields",
    "Deploy Calming Mechanisms: Introduce meditative or reflective interventions to stabilize consciousness",
    "Execute Svadharma Re-alignment Process: Guide individuals back into their natural cosmic roles under Brahminic oversight",
    "Complete Integration Cycle: Confirm energetic and social reintegration without residual fragmentation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Law. This ruling restores Dharma through consciousness-centered jurisprudence. Justice serves only reintegration, never punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness. Dharma is restored."
