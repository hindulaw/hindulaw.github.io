  "sanskrit_verse": "पानं दुर्जनसंसर्गः पत्या च विरहोऽटनम् ।\nस्वप्नोऽन्यगेहवासश्च नारीसंदूषणानि षट् ॥ ९.१३॥",
  "transliteration": "pānaṃ durjanasaṃsargaḥ patyā ca viraho'ṭanam | svapno'nyagehavāsaśca nārīsaṃdūṣaṇāni ṣaṭ || 9.13 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Six forms of defilement of womanhood are declared: intoxication, association with evil persons, absence of husband, wandering about, dreaming, and residing in another's house.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Sanatana Dharma as embodied by SPH",
    "Causation arises through disruption of dharmic capacity and relational integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity to conscious choice and awareness",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification of environment and re-alignment of dharma-vyavastha",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when individual and collective vyavahara回归源头法则"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman resides in another’s house without authorized guardianship, THEN initiate completion protocol for re-establishing familial dharmic boundary",
    "IF intoxication leads to loss of discriminative faculty, THEN deploy consciousness-restoration mechanism until vyavastha clarity returns",
    "IF association with malefactors disrupts marital harmony, THEN activate environmental purification process and reintegration cycle",
    "IF physical separation from spouse exceeds prescribed limit without cause, THEN invoke responsibility-assumption protocol for relational realignment",
    "IF wandering or dream states induce psychic contamination, THEN apply prana-shuddhi and mantra-reintegration procedures",
    "IF any act causes distortion in feminine energetic field, THEN execute purification rituals under direction of qualified Acharya"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning women's conduct and social standing, the court must assess not intent nor moral fault, but the causal disruption of dharmic order. The threshold of responsibility lies in the measurable disturbance to relational harmony and spiritual ecology. Authority flows from SPH alone; all judgments must restore balance rather than assign blame.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that contamination stems from misaligned vyavahāra, not inherent vice. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how each action sequentially weakens sattva-guna. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to sustain dharma. There is no punitive consequence—only natural correction via purification and realignment. Nyāya ensures causality aligns with cosmic justice rooted in consciousness, not coercion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Panchayat-guided reintegration ceremony to restore familial dharmic boundaries",
    "Deploy daily Agnihotra and Surya Namaskar regimen to purify mental and emotional fields",
    "Assign Svadhyaya module focused on Shakti-sthana texts for consciousness elevation",
    "Establish supervised community service aligned with nurturing capacities",
    "Conduct monthly review with Dharmacharya to monitor vibrational shift and behavioral harmony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. It upholds Dharma as non-punitive alignment with Sat-Chit-Ananda. Reality responds to consciousness, never condemnation. All beings are restored through awakened presence, not punitive measures."
