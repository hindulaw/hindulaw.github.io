  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The first offense is constituted by the contamination, splitting, or adulteration of pure substances, and by the misrepresentation of gems.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the purity and integrity of manifesting consciousness",
    "Causation arises through distortion of essential nature",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies with the one who alters or falsifies reality",
    "Restoration logic demands the re-establishment of original purity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment and reversal of adulteration"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a substance is altered from its pure state THEN initiate restoration protocol",
    "IF a gem is misrepresented THEN invoke authenticity verification mechanism",
    "IF contamination is detected THEN isolate causal agent and restore source integrity",
    "IF adulteration occurs THEN reverse process and realign with original form",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that tampering with fundamental truths or material realities constitutes the primary legal threshold. Responsibility rests with the actor whose capacity enabled deviation. The court's function is to restore the unaltered state, not to punish.",
