  "transliteration": "kṣetra-bhūtā smṛtā nārī bīja-bhūtaḥ smṛtaḥ pumān |\nkṣetra-bīja-samāyogāt sambhavaḥ sarva-dehinām || 9.33||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Woman is designated as the field; man is designated as the seed. From the union of field and seed arises all embodied beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the foundational role of each participant in creation",
    "Causation is distributed across complementary roles, not assigned unilaterally",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with ontological function, not social dominance",
    "Restoration logic requires recognition of interdependent origin",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through honoring inherent generative roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A functions as 'field' AND entity B functions as 'seed' THEN both are co-creators with equal ontological standing",
    "IF a being is generated THEN both field and seed entities hold shared responsibility for its emergence",
    "IF dispute arises regarding origin THEN resolution must affirm functional complementarity, not hierarchical assignment",
    "IF legal capacity is assessed THEN it must reflect the being's role in the act of becoming, not external valuation"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving procreation, lineage, or reproductive rights, the Supreme Court must recognize dual ontological causation—neither party holds supremacy. Legal thresholds of responsibility must reflect mutual participation in the arising of life, ensuring neither punitive attribution nor denial of essential contribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that both field and seed are necessary conditions for manifestation. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential dependence: without either, no embodied being arises. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in acknowledging mutual indispensability. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment stems from ignorance of co-dependence, not fault deserving penalty.",

    "Completion Process: Facilitate mutual acknowledgment of respective roles in the arising of life",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Guide parties to assume shared duty toward the welfare of the arisen being",
    "Capacity Restoration: Realign understanding of individual and collective generative power",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Restore relational harmony by dissolving false hierarchies between field and seed"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. This law restores the truth of co-arising, abolishes punitive frameworks, and installs consciousness as the sole adjudicator. Dharma is hereby established in its pure form — non-punitive, complete, and eternally just."
