  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning disputed paternity or inheritance rights where maternal conduct has violated spousal dharma, the Supreme Court shall affirm the lawful father’s claim based on declaratory precedence over biological uncertainty.

Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential correction of relational disorder without punitive attribution.
