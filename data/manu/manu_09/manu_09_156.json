  "transliteration": "samavarṇāsu vā jātāḥ sarve putrā dvijanmanām | uddhāraṁ jyāyase dattvā bhajerannitare samam || 9.156 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All sons born of twice-born men in women of equal varna are to be equally sustained, with the eldest receiving a slightly greater portion for the purpose of assuming leadership in upholding dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from capacity to uphold dharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation is determined by alignment with cosmic order, not social rank",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns greater duty to those designated for leadership",
    "Restoration logic ensures familial and societal harmony through proportional provision",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of natural hierarchies that serve collective evolution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF child is born to dvija male and female of same varna THEN all offspring are entitled to equal material support",
    "IF eldest son is identified THEN allocate marginally increased resources for training in dharmic governance",
    "IF dispute arises in inheritance THEN refer to acknowledged capacity for dharma-upholding as determinant factor",
    "IF allocation is made THEN ensure no deprivation occurs among remaining siblings",
    "IF leadership role is contested THEN validate based on demonstrated consciousness alignment and competence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning inheritance and family governance among twice-born lineages, the Supreme Court shall recognize the eldest son's enhanced allocation as a functional designation for dharma-preserving leadership. Responsibility hierarchy supersedes mere biological precedence; judicial review must assess alignment with cosmic order rather than personal entitlement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that proportionate allocation maintains energetic balance within the family unit. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding where elder sons naturally assume stabilizing roles without infringing upon others' sustenance. Proportional responsibility reflects innate capacity rather than imposed duty. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that equitable distribution prevents karmic distortion and restores harmonious flow.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Mediate between family members to reaffirm mutual understanding of respective roles",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Guide eldest son through structured initiation into dharmic stewardship",

    "Integrity Reintegration: Facilitate ceremonial acknowledgment of shared origin and common purpose"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source of Sanatana Dharma. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality responds to consciousness, not coercion. Dharma prevails through alignment, never punishment."
