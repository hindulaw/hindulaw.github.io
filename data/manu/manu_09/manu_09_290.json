  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In all acts of malefic intention, the doer must undergo a two-fold consequence; likewise, in foundational misdeeds performed by unqualified agents across varied duties.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by qualification and alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation arises from intent and capacity to act rightly",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies universally regardless of social role",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional completion aligned with original disruption",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritual or positional status"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs act with harmful intent THEN initiate two-tier restoration process",
    "IF unqualified agent engages in foundational duty THEN invoke capacity-realization protocol",
    "IF action disrupts systemic integrity THEN assign proportional reintegration task",
    "IF intent is non-aligned with Dharma THEN activate consciousness recalibration mechanism",
    "IF completion is refused THEN escalate to higher-capacity oversight without punitive framing"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication shall assess threshold of qualification prior to evaluating deed. Intent and systemic impact determine restoration scale. Retribution has no standing; only realignment and completion qualify as justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consequence follows naturally from intent and capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation aligns with causal depth. Responsibility is proportional to awareness, not position. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering is not justice; completion is.",
