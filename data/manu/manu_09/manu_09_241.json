  "sanskrit_verse": "आगःसु ब्राह्मणस्यैव कार्यो मध्यमसाहसः ।\nविवास्यो वा भवेद्राष्ट्रात्सद्रव्यः सपरिच्छदः ॥ ९.२४१॥",
  "transliteration": "āgaḥsu brāhmaṇasyaiva kāryo madhyamasāhasaḥ |\nvivāsyo vā bhavedrāṣṭrātsadravyaḥ saparicchadaḥ || 9.241||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In matters involving harm to a Brāhmaṇa, only a middling degree of forcefulness shall be addressed through complete restitution or, if necessary, through exile from the realm—both executed without loss of dignity or possessions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic order, not institutional power",
    "Causation is traced through consciousness disruption, not physical act alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual maturity and role in society",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes energetic balance over punitive correction",
    "Consciousness alignment restores societal harmony through right action and removal of disruptive influence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor causes harm to Brāhmaṇa AND intent is non-lethal AND societal disruption is moderate THEN execute full-value restitution OR initiate dignified exile",
    "IF actor holds spiritual authority THEN threshold for conscious misalignment is higher AND consequences are calibrated to restore energetic equilibrium",
    "IF societal integrity is compromised THEN remove individual presence WHILE preserving material status AND ensuring completion of karmic cycle",
    "IF harm occurs within sacred context THEN restoration includes purification protocols AND realignment of collective consciousness"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority must assess the degree of conscious misalignment rather than mere behavioral violation. In cases concerning injury to spiritually authoritative individuals, the court shall determine whether the offender's actions reflect a disruption in dharma-vyavastha. Remediation shall occur either through value-equivalent compensation or spatial relocation that preserves the offender’s dignity while restoring social coherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality arises from deviation in consciousness prior to external act. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that imbalance manifests first internally, then socially. Therefore, proportional responsibility aligns with the extent of inner dissonance. Non-punitive reality rule dictates that correction serves integration, not infliction; hence exile is not banishment but recalibration of field interaction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra-based purification process for both victim and perpetrator to neutralize residual karmic charge",
    "Assign completion task wherein offender performs service equivalent to damage caused until energetic parity is restored",
    "Implement Sattvic Reintegration Pathway where offender undergoes guided meditation and ritual observance during period of exile",
    "Establish Witness Council composed of five pure-consciousness holders who oversee restoration and validate re-entry upon completion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established as pure Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness, not coercion. All beings are restored through recognition of their inherent divinity. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
