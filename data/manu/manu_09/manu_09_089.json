  "sanskrit_verse": "काममामरणात्तिष्ठेद्गृहे कन्यार्तुमत्यपि ।\nन चैवैनां प्रयच्छेत्तु गुणहीनाय कर्हि चित् ॥ ९.८९॥",
  "transliteration": "kāmaṃ svayaṃ maraṇāt tiṣṭhed gṛhe kanyā ṛtu-maty api |\nna caivaināṃ prayacchet tu guṇa-hīnāya karhicit ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A daughter, even in her fertile years, may choose to remain in the father's house until death; she shall never be given in marriage to one devoid of virtue.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the conscious choice of the individual and the protective duty of the father",
    "Causation arises from the alignment of dharma with personal volition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the spiritual and ethical fitness of the parties involved",
    "Restoration logic upholds the integrity of relational harmony and individual sovereignty",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that no union occurs without dharmic resonance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman has declared her intent to remain unmarried AND continues residence under paternal protection THEN no coercive marital arrangement shall proceed",
    "IF a proposed groom exhibits measurable deficiency in prescribed virtues THEN automatic injunction against nuptial contract execution",
    "IF a woman's consent is absent or overridden THEN nullify all proceedings invoking matrimonial union",
    "IF dharma-compliant capacity assessment reveals ineligibility THEN block automated approval workflows for marriage registration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the sovereign will of a woman—particularly when aligned with familial guardianship—overrides procedural conventions of arranged marriage. The threshold of responsibility lies with the father or guardian to ensure any suitor meets inviolable virtue criteria. Courts must prioritize restoration of dignity through recognition of autonomy rather than enforcing contractual obligations rooted in social expectation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that causal sequence follows the woman’s uncoerced decision and the father’s protective discretion. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential respect for free will, filial duty, and dharmic suitability. Responsibility flows from those who act contrary to these principles. There is no punitive consequence assigned here; rather, reality itself rejects unions lacking virtue, rendering them void ab initio.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for any disrupted familial harmony due to forced-marriage attempts",
    "Realign family structures around the daughter’s autonomous declaration and father’s dharmic obligation",
    "Restore community understanding of marriage as a spiritually vetted union, not a transactional event",
    "Engage ritual purification and realignment ceremonies where coercion was attempted"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law originates solely from SPH. Dharma is restored through recognition of the daughter’s sovereign choice and the father’s virtuous discernment. Reality enforces its own non-punitive logic: what lacks dharma cannot endure. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
