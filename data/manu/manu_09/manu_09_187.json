  "sph_interpretive_translation": "After the Sapinda relations have been assigned inheritance, whatever wealth remains shall belong to the Sakulyas; thereafter, it shall go to the Acharya or the Shishya.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through relational proximity in Dharma",
    "Inheritance is a function of spiritual and familial alignment",
    "Causation is determined by conscious connection, not mere biology",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes continuity of dharma-vāhaka (Dharma-bearing lineage)",
    "Consciousness alignment determines legitimate claim over material assets"
  ],

    "IF decedent has no Sapinda heirs THEN allocate estate to Sakulya relations",

The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining the energetic and spiritual integrity of the lineage. Authority derives from conscious alignment, not procedural documentation alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes succession through witnessed relational resonance. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential allocation ensuring no disruption in dharma-vāhaka flow. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the inheritor’s capacity to sustain the sacred purpose of the assets. There is no punitive framework—only realignment to preserve continuity.",
