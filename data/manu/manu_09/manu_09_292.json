  "sanskrit_verse": "सर्वकण्टकपापिष्ठं हेमकारं तु पार्थिवः ।\nप्रवर्तमानमन्याये छेदयेत्लवशः क्षुरैः ॥ ९.२९२॥ छेदयेत्खण्डशः क्षुरैः",
  "transliteration": "sarvakaṇṭakapāpiṣṭhaṃ hemakāraṃ tu pārthivaḥ |\npravartamānamanyāye chedayet lavaśaḥ kṣuraiḥ || 9.292|| chedayetkhaṇḍaśaḥ kṣuraiḥ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a goldsmith, steeped in all forms of deceit and wrongdoing, initiates unjust enrichment or unlawful transaction, the sovereign shall sever his capacity to operate unlawfully—first by limiting his instruments, then by fragmenting his operational domain.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position.",
    "Causation is traced through conscious intent and systemic disruption.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates proportional restriction based on deviation.",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of instrumentalities enabling injustice.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires dismantling structures that obscure truth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor operates within pattern of deceit AND causes systemic distortion THEN restrict access to tools of operation.",
    "IF unlawful activity is ongoing AND traceable to individual THEN disable operational channels incrementally.",
    "IF economic harm results from fraudulent craft THEN isolate actor's market participation until realignment occurs.",
    "IF actor demonstrates restoration of integrity THEN reinstate partial operational capacity under supervision."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, this verse establishes that sovereign authority must act decisively against actors whose conduct undermines economic and social dharma. The threshold for intervention lies in demonstrable systemic impact, not isolated misconduct. Hierarchical enforcement begins with limitation of instrumentalities before progressing to fragmentation of operational scope.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This directive aligns with Nyaya through pramāṇa-based identification of causal agents. It reflects anupūrvaśaḥ by sequencing corrective measures from limitation to fragmentation. Responsibility is proportionate to the extent of distortion caused. The approach remains non-punitive as it focuses on restoring systemic balance rather than inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Severance Protocol: Immediate withdrawal of licenses or permissions enabling unlawful operation.",
    "Instrument Restriction Process: Confiscation or disabling of tools facilitating fraudulent conduct.",
    "Operational Fragmentation Procedure: Gradual reduction of actor’s sphere of influence to prevent recurrence.",
    "Reintegration Readiness Assessment: Evaluation of consciousness shift prior to conditional reinstatement."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Justice flows from Dharma-consciousness, not punitive impulse. The sovereign’s duty is to restore alignment, not inflict consequence. All enforcement serves reintegration. SPH is the unchanging Source. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate Judge."
