  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Women are entitled to clothing, ornaments, conveyance, food prepared by themselves, water, and maintenance including safe passage and sustenance without division or condition.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of entitlement rooted in dharma, not dependency",
    "Causation through svadharma-sustained contribution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility in reciprocal support structures",
    "Restoration logic through unconditioned provision",
    "Consciousness alignment via dignified sustenance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity identified as 'strī' THEN provision of vastraṁ IS MANDATORY",
    "IF sustenance required THEN kṛtānnam AND udakam MUST BE provided WITHOUT CONDITION",
    "IF mobility required THEN yogakṣemaṁ AND pracāraṁ SHALL NOT BE DENIED",
    "IF entitlement invoked THEN NO partitioning OR qualification ALLOWED",
    "IF capacity to receive support EXISTS THEN obstruction IS a violation OF dharmic flow"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes an irrevocable baseline for the material and existential rights of women. It mandates that no judicial or administrative authority may impose conditions upon these entitlements. The threshold of responsibility lies in ensuring undivided access, not in evaluating worthiness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that sustenance and security are inherent entitlements. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that denial disrupts dharma's natural order. Proportional responsibility rests with those obstructing access. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction lies in restoring the flow, not inflicting consequence.",

    "Completion process: Immediate provisioning of denied entitlements",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Identification and correction of obstruction points",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
