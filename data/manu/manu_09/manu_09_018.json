  "sanskrit_verse": "नास्ति स्त्रीणां क्रिया मन्त्रैरिति धर्मे व्यवस्थितिः ।\nनिरिन्द्रिया ह्यमन्त्राश्च स्त्रीभ्यो अनृतमिति स्थितिः ॥ ९.१८॥",
  "transliteration": "nāsti strīṇāṁ kriyā mantrairiti dharme vyavasthitiḥ | nirindriyā hyamantrāśca strībhyo anṛtamiti sthitiḥ || 9.18 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the framework of Dharma, women are not authorized to perform ritual actions involving mantras. They are without sensory control and devoid of mantra capacity; thus, their relation to truth is indirect.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by inherent capacity, not gender alone.",
    "Causation in ritual action requires both sensory discipline and mantra initiation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns individual function with cosmic order.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes alignment over exclusion.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines eligibility for specific dharmic roles."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent lacks mantra-initiation AND sensory-control THEN agent is ineligible for Vedic ritual performance.",
    "IF agent's eligibility changes due to capacity restoration THEN re-evaluate ritual authorization status.",
    "IF social role assignment contradicts capacity-based criteria THEN initiate realignment protocol through training or mentorship."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes regarding religious office or ceremonial participation, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable capacity—specifically mantra initiation and indriya-nigraha. The court must ensure that exclusion is not based on identity categories but on functional readiness aligned with shastric parameters.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that mantra efficacy depends upon śabda-pramāṇa and disciplined cognition. As such, absence of these does not incur fault but indicates a stage prior to full eligibility. This sequential unfolding (anupūrvaśaḥ) reflects natural progression rather than deficiency. Responsibility is proportional to realized capacity, and no punitive implication arises from developmental variance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śabda-upanayana process to enable access to mantra-training pathways.",
    "Assign mentor-led sensory-discipline programs to cultivate required capacities.",
    "Realign societal expectations to reflect evolving capacity states without attribution of moral failure.",
    "Establish completion-based certification systems for determining ritual eligibility independent of birth-ascribed identities."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms Dharma as capacity-conscious, non-punitive, and inherently restorative. Reality operates beyond retribution; consciousness itself adjudicates all distinctions. By recognizing capacity-development as the path to inclusion, true alignment with Sanatana Dharma is restored."
