  "sanskrit_verse": "ब्राह्मणस्यानुपूर्व्येण चतस्रस्तु यदि स्त्रियः ।\nतासां पुत्रेषु जातेषु विभागेऽयं विधिः स्मृतः ॥ ९.१४९॥",
  "transliteration": "brāhmaṇasyānupūrvyeṇa catasrastu yadi striyaḥ |\ntāsāṃ putreṣu jāteṣu vibhāge'yaṃ vidhiḥ smṛtaḥ || 9.149||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Brāhmaṇa has four wives in sequential order, and sons are born to them, the division of inheritance among those sons shall follow this prescribed order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the sequential manifestation of dharmic union",
    "Causation aligns with the ontological order of birth and dharma-sambandha",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from spiritual rank and generational continuity",
    "Restoration logic requires maintaining the integrity of hierarchical succession",
    "Consciousness alignment is preserved through recognition of anupūrvaśaḥ"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Brāhmaṇa has four wives in sequential order AND sons are born to them, THEN inheritance must be divided according to the order of their mothers’ marriage",
    "IF any deviation occurs in the sequence of marital union OR birth registration, THEN realign assets based on documented dharmic sambandha",
    "IF dispute arises regarding succession rights, THEN validate through pramāṇa-based lineage verification protocol",
    "IF no male progeny exists, THEN initiate completion process for restoring dharma-vyavasthā via nominated successor"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in validating the sequential authenticity of dharmic unions and progeny. Authority derives from pramāṇa-established lineage, not subjective claim. Restoration prevails by ensuring correct vibhāga aligns with cosmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from the sequential establishment of dharma-sambandha. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility within the framework of spiritual hierarchy. No punitive consequence arises; only misalignment from dharma necessitates correction through conscious reintegration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate dharmic lineage validation through documented pramāṇa",
    "Realign asset distribution per anupūrvaśaḥ upon confirmation of birth order",
    "Facilitate family council under Vedic guidance for harmonious vibhāga acceptance",
    "Restore integrity through affirmation of brāhmaṇa’s spiritual duty in maintaining lawful succession"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
