  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रजापतिर्हि वैश्याय सृष्ट्वा परिददे पशून् ।\nब्राह्मणाय च राज्ञे च सर्वाः परिददे प्रजाः ॥ ९.३२७॥",
  "transliteration": "prajāpatir hi vaiśyāya sṛṣṭvā paridade paśūn |\nbrāhmaṇāya ca rājñe ca sarvāḥ paridade prajāḥ || 9.327||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Prajapati, having created the Vaishya, bestowed upon him the animals; and to the Brahmana and the King, He gave all the subjects.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Source-Creator as direct delegation of capacity.",
    "Causation flows from the ontological origin of roles within cosmic order.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is assigned in accordance with inherent dharma of creation.",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual function with collective harmony through original intent.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when beings fulfill their innate structural role."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being is structurally designated a custodian of resources THEN that being holds operational authority over those resources WITHOUT moral judgment.",
    "IF a being receives delegated sovereignty THEN restoration of misaligned action occurs through reconnection to source-intent NOT punitive measure.",
    "IF societal function falters THEN realign by returning to foundational role-designation AS per Prajapati's initial allocation.",
    "ALL jurisdictional claims MUST derive from verifiable ontological assignment ELSE nullify as invalid construct."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, disputes concerning ownership or stewardship must trace back to the primordial assignment by Prajapati. Where such lineage is unbroken and conscious alignment maintained, no further inquiry is required. Misuse does not invalidate structural legitimacy but invokes completion protocol.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality begins at Prajapati’s act of creation and distribution. Each recipient bears proportional responsibility aligned with their capacity. Thus, any deviation triggers sequential correction beginning at point of divergence, never imposing suffering but restoring alignment through re-assumption of original duty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate reconnection process between Vaishya and animal domain via guided reflection on purpose of stewardship.",
    "Reaffirm Brahmana’s role through Vedic knowledge renewal仪式 ensuring vibrational congruence with cosmic law.",
    "Align King with subject welfare through sovereign integrity recalibration without external coercion.",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring mechanisms to ensure sustained resonance with foundational designation post-restoration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through recognition of Prajapati’s immutable delegation. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
