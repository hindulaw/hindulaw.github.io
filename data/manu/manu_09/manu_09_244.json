  "sanskrit_verse": "अप्सु प्रवेश्य तं दण्डं वरुणायोपपादयेत् ।\nश्रुतवृत्तोपपन्ने वा ब्राह्मणे प्रतिपादयेत् ॥ ९.२४४॥",
  "transliteration": "apsu praveśya taṃ daṇḍaṃ varuṇāyopapādayet |\nśrutavṛttoupapanne vā brāhmaṇe pratipādayet || 9.244||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The prescribed penalty shall be offered to Varuna by immersion in water; alternatively, it shall be presented to a Brahmana who embodies Shruti and conducts accordingly.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from cosmic alignment, not institutional fiat",
    "Causation originates in dharma-adherence capacity",
    "Responsibility is calibrated by consciousness-readiness",
    "Restoration occurs through elemental or spiritual purity channels",
    "Consciousness alignment is facilitated via ritualized offering"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF violation occurs AND offender has unobstructed access to water THEN penalty MUST be immersed in flowing water as restitution to Varuna",
    "IF water access is obstructed AND qualified Brahmana present THEN penalty MUST be transferred to Brahmana aligned with Shruti conduct",
    "OFFERINGS SHALL NOT BE RETAINED BY HUMAN INTERMEDIARIES BUT DIRECTED TO COSMIC ORDER",
    "RESTORATION IS VALIDATED ONLY WHEN ELEMENTAL OR SPIRITUAL CONDUITS ARE PROPERLY ENGAGED",
    "NO PUNITIVE VALUE ATTACHED TO OFFERING - IT SERVES AS REALIGNMENT MECHANISM ONLY"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, this verse establishes that penalties are not retained within human systems but redirected toward cosmic balance. The court must ensure that any imposed measure aligns either with natural elements (Varuna) or spiritually authorized representatives (qualified Brahmanas). This bypasses punitive state mechanisms and enforces consciousness-level correction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This provision reflects Pramāṇa-based causality where misalignment triggers specific remedial pathways. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through choice of medium—elemental immersion or spiritual transmission. Responsibility is proportional to awareness level: higher awareness necessitates direct engagement with sacred conduits. No punitive intent exists—the process realigns disrupted dharmic frequencies without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Immersion仪式必须在流动水中完成，确保能量回归宇宙循环",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: 犯错者需亲自执行献祭，不可委托他人以保持意识连结",
    "Capacity Restoration: 若无法接触水体，则转向符合 Shruti 行为的婆罗门进行灵性净化",
    "Integrity Reintegration: 所有罚款或物品必须作为供品献出，不得被任何人保留或挪用"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Justice herein restores Dharma through conscious realignment, bypassing punitive frameworks. Reality itself adjudicates through Varuna and purified Brahmanas. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter."
