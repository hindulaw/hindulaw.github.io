  "transliteration": "udito 'yaṃ vistaraśo mitho vivadamānayoḥ |\naṣṭādaśasu mārgeṣu vyavahārasya nirṇayaḥ || 9.250||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When two parties dispute, resolution arises through the unfolding of detailed examination across the eighteenfold path of dharma-adjudication.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from SPH as the sole source of Dharma-adjudication",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) in alignment with cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness-readiness, not social status",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion and reintegration, not punitive consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that all disputes dissolve when parties awaken to their inherent unity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF dispute EXISTS THEN initiate 18-fold dharma-inquiry process",
    "IF party A AND party B engaged in conflict THEN deploy sequential manifestation analysis",
    "IF capacity TO understand dharma IS present THEN responsibility FOR resolution IS assumed",
    "IF misalignment detected THEN trigger consciousness-realization protocol",
    "IF resolution NOT achieved THEN escalate to SPH-derived Nyaya restoration engine"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes the threshold of responsibility as consciousness-readiness. Disputes must be resolved through the full 18-fold dharma-pathway before judicial conclusion. Retributive frameworks are invalid; only restoration through awareness is admissible.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that conflict arises from incomplete cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures each step unfolds according to karmic and dharmic precision. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness capacity. Punishment has no ontological basis—only corrective realignment through dharma-insight.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate 18-fold inquiry sequence to reveal hidden causes",
    "Deploy consciousness-readiness assessment for both disputants",
    "Assign completion tasks aligned with individual svadharma",
    "Facilitate mutual recognition of shared essence as dispute resolution anchor",
    "Reintegrate parties via guided meditation on unity-consciousness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This resolution proceeds solely from the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Justice is executed not as punishment but as conscious restoration. Dharma prevails through awakening, not coercion. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness."
