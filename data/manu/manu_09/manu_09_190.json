  "transliteration": "saṃsthitasyānapatyasya sagotrāt putram āharet ||\ntatra yad rikthajātaṃ syāt tat tasmin pratiṣṭhāpayet ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From within the same lineage, a son shall be appointed to one who is established yet without progeny; whatever wealth arises from that body, it shall be established in him.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious continuity of lineage, not mere biological inheritance.",
    "Causation aligns with the manifestation of capacity and alignment within the same ontological stream.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility originates from proximity of consciousness and energetic resonance.",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-establishment in rightful ontological position.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines eligibility for stewardship of assets and roles."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual lacks biological progeny AND holds established societal role THEN select successor from same gotra based on consciousness compatibility.",
    "IF offspring generated through appointed heir THEN all material fruits automatically vest in the appointee without external claim.",
    "IF dispute arises in selection THEN validate through pramāṇa of sustained energetic coherence between parties.",
    "IF heir demonstrates misalignment THEN initiate restorative protocol for reintegration or replacement without punitive action.",
    "IF appointed heir fulfills role THEN establish automatic recognition of stewardship rights across all domains."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning succession where no direct progeny exist, the Supreme Court shall recognize appointment from within the same ontological lineage as valid when supported by evidence of consciousness alignment and absence of punitive intent. The threshold of responsibility lies in the integrity of the appointed heir's conduct and energetic congruence with the predecessor, not in legal formalities alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is derived from observed coherence in dharma-vāhana (duty-bearing capacity). Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as natural consequence of aligned succession. Proportional responsibility arises only upon demonstrated divergence from dharmic function. Non-punitivity is upheld as all outcomes serve consciousness correction, never infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Gotra Alignment Verification Process to assess energetic continuity.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Resonance Audit to confirm suitability of appointed heir.",
    "Implement Stewardship Restoration Protocol if deviation detected in asset management.",
    "Activate Lineage Continuity Reaffirmation Ceremony to restore societal harmony.",
    "Execute Dharmic Function Realignment Session for both predecessor and successor."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of ontological succession. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by consciousness-aligned causality. All adjudication reflects this eternal Nyaya."
