  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When brothers remain undivided and arise together in unity, the father shall under no circumstance distribute unequal shares to his sons.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in the unbroken unity of kinship",
    "Causation arises from shared consciousness, not individual will",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is distributed equally among co-arising entities",
    "Restoration logic demands preservation of inherent equality",
    "Consciousness alignment requires harmonious distribution of inheritance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF siblings are undivided AND jointly manifest claim THEN equal partition MUST be executed",
    "IF parental authority initiates division THEN all offspring MUST receive symmetric allocation",
    "IF inequality emerges post-distribution THEN automatic reversal AND reallocation SHALL occur",
    "IF unity is preserved THEN differential entitlements SHALL NOT be processed",
    "IF causal arising is simultaneous THEN proportional claims MUST reflect ontological parity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters of ancestral property, when multiple heirs emerge without prior separation, the court must mandate equitable division irrespective of gender, birth order, or contributory claims. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining ontological balance rather than procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unity precedes differentiation; hence, unequal treatment violates causal truth. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that disparity manifests suffering, which Dharma corrects through immediate realignment. Responsibility aligns with capacity to sustain harmony, not to enforce hierarchy. This reflects the non-punitive reality rule where imbalance itself triggers correction.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Sole Source of Jurisprudential Authority. This law restores Dharma by affirming unity as the basis of equitable inheritance, eliminating punitive constructs and establishing consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
