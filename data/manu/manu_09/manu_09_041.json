  "transliteration": "tatprājñena vinītena jñānavijñānavedina | āyuṣkāmena vaptavyaṁ na jātu parayoṣiti || 9.41||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who seeks longevity and is wise, disciplined, and knowledgeable in both knowledge and realization shall never approach another's wife.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma-consciousness",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires self-regulation and discriminative awareness",
    "Restoration logic operates by returning the individual to their innate state of purity",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful action"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_discriminative_knowledge() AND agent.seeks_longevity() THEN agent.must.avoid_approaching_another_woman()",
    "IF agent.violates.axiom_1 THEN system.initiates.consciousness_realignment_protocol()",
    "IF agent.completes.realignment THEN system.restores.integrity_status()"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity for discriminative knowledge. The court must verify whether the accused possessed prajna (discriminative wisdom) and was oriented toward ayus (life-force preservation). If so, violation constitutes a conscious deviation requiring realignment rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality confirms that one possessing discriminative awareness chooses actions aligned with dharma. Sequential manifestation shows that approaching another’s wife disrupts life-force integrity. Proportional responsibility is thus determined by internal capacity, not external provocation. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that misalignment distorts consciousness, which must be restored without infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vedantic inquiry process to restore discriminative awareness",
    "Assign completion practices to reestablish life-force coherence",
    "Implement guru-disciple dialogue for integrity reintegration",
    "Realign personal conduct within dharmic boundaries under witness-consciousness supervision"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This directive proceeds solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma. Justice serves only restoration, never retribution. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
