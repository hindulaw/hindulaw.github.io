  "sanskrit_verse": "न च वैश्यस्य कामः स्यान्न रक्षेयं पशूनिति ।\nवैश्ये चेच्छति नान्येन रक्षितव्याः कथं चन ॥ ९.३२८॥",
  "transliteration": "na ca vaiśyasya kāmaḥ syān na rakṣeyaṃ paśūn iti | vaiśye cecchati nānyena rakṣitavyāḥ kathaṃ cana || 9.328 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If the Vaiśya does not desire to protect cattle, then by no means should others be expected to protect them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from capacity and volition",
    "Causation originates in conscious choice",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines obligation",
    "Restoration logic aligns with natural duty",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes social function"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent X possesses volitional capacity AND chooses non-protection of resource Y THEN agent X forfeits expectation of external protection for Y",
    "IF entity A declines functional role R THEN entity A cannot obligate entities B-Z to perform R",
    "IF individual I disowns stewardship S THEN collective enforcement shall not assume liability for S"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters where a designated custodian or class voluntarily abdicates their functional duty—such as environmental stewardship or economic guardianship—the court shall recognize that no derivative liability transfers to other parties. The threshold of responsibility remains rooted in original volition, not passive expectation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality begins with conscious will. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, consequence follows intention. Since protection was neither willed nor enacted by the Vaiśya, no punitive burden may fall upon another. Responsibility is proportionally aligned with volition, maintaining dharma through awareness rather than coercion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Realign volition through dharmic education to reclaim natural duty",
    "Initiate completion process wherein the Vaiśya reaffirms or redefines stewardship",
    "Engage community integration protocols to restore shared understanding of functional roles",
    "Implement consciousness recalibration via sādhanā to awaken latent sense of custodianship"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores integrity through conscious alignment, upholds natural order without recourse to punishment, and affirms that reality itself adjudicates through awakened consciousness."
