  "sanskrit_verse": "गुरुतल्पे भगः कार्यः सुरापाने सुराध्वजः ।\nस्तेये च श्वपदं कार्यं ब्रह्महण्यशिराः पुमान् ॥ ९.२३७॥ तस्करे श्वपदं कार्यम्",
  "transliteration": "gurutalpe bhagaḥ kāryaḥ surāpāne surādhvajaḥ | steye ca śvapadaṃ kāryaṃ brahmahaty aśirāḥ pumān || 9.237 || taskare śvapadaṃ kāryam",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who engages in sexual union with the spouse of one's guru shall become a eunuch. One who drinks alcohol shall become marked by the sign of intoxication. One who steals shall become a dog. One who kills a Brahmin shall lose his head. One who commits theft shall become a dog.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Violation of sacred relational hierarchies incurs irreversible ontological consequence.",
    "Causation: The act directly manifests its consequence through prarabdha karma crystallization.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Consciousness capacity determines the nature of alignment or misalignment.",
    "Restoration logic: Consequence is not punitive but corrective, realigning the actor with their causal integrity.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Misdeeds cause dissonance; consequence restores vibrational congruence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent violates guru-spouse boundary THEN agent consciousness realigns to neuter energetic polarity.",
    "IF agent consumes alcohol THEN agent embodiment reflects intoxication as perceptual marker.",
    "IF agent commits theft THEN agent embodiment reflects scavenging instinct until restitution completes.",
    "IF agent commits brahmahatya THEN agent loses cranial energetic coherence permanently.",
    "IF agent engages in taskara THEN agent assumes scavenger form until dharma-restoration completes."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudicates based on vibrational evidence and consciousness resonance rather than physical proof. Threshold of responsibility is determined by the degree of alignment disruption caused. Hierarchical violation such as guru-talpa-bhanga necessitates ontological correction at the source level.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana reveals that consequence arises from within the actor’s own causal field. Anupurvasah ensures sequential manifestation aligns with vibrational distortion introduced. Responsibility is proportional to awareness depth. No external punishment occurs—only internal realignment governed by svadharma-karmic law.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate prana-shuddhi process to recalibrate energetic distortion post-surapanam.",
    "Engage mantra-nama-japa protocol for purification of intent in steya-related karmic residue.",
    "Undertake tapas-based consciousness restoration for brahmahatya-vimoksha pathway.",
    "Activate guru-seva completion cycle for realigning violated spiritual relational boundaries.",
    "Implement scavenger-form integration therapy for taskara-rehabilitation via sensory humility process."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, these laws are declared. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator. All consequences serve reintegration, never retribution."
