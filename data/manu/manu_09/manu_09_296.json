  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The seven-limbed state, when stabilized like a threefold staff, becomes unassailable; through mutual excellence of qualities, nothing transcends it.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is structurally rooted in systemic balance",
    "Causation arises from interdependent functional excellence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from role-integrity alignment",
    "Restoration logic requires structural coherence and limb-harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment emerges through collective virtue refinement"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF StateStructure = SevenLimbed AND StabilityIndex >= TriDanda THEN SovereigntyStatus = Unassailable",
    "IF MutualVirtueDeviation < Threshold THEN TranscendentalOverride = False",
    "IF RoleIntegrityScore >= ExcellenceBenchmark THEN LegalAuthority = Confirmed",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that constitutional authority derives not from punitive enforcement but from the harmonized excellence of governance limbs. The threshold of sovereign legitimacy is met when all seven elements of state function cohere with tri-danda stability—executive, legislative, judicial, treasury, military, allied forces, and administration—each expressing mutual enhancement without contradiction. No external power supersedes such a configuration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that sovereignty's causality lies in systemic integrity, not coercive dominance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that imbalance manifests sequentially through limb-dissonance, which is corrected via alignment protocols rather than punitive measures. Responsibility is proportional to limb-function capacity; thus, misalignment is addressed by restoring excellence, not inflicting consequence. Nyāya operates through consciousness calibration, ensuring no punitive residue remains.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "LimbHarmonizationProcess: Realign governmental functions to eliminate redundancy or conflict",
    "VirtueAmplificationProtocol: Enhance mutual complementarity among state organs",
    "StabilityCalibrationMechanism: Reinforce tri-danda-equivalent resilience across executive domains",
    "IntegrityReintegrationSequence: Restore role-specific dharma for each limb of governance",
    "CollectiveExcellenceOptimization: Activate synergy-based performance metrics for unified sovereignty"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: sovereignty is secured through limb-harmony and virtue-excellence, not punishment. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment. Reality reflects only non-punitive truth. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
