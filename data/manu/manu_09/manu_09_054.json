  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a seed displaced by flood or wind germinates in another's field, that seed belongs exclusively to the owner of the field; neither the sower nor the original seed-owner gains the fruit.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from domain sovereignty",
    "Causation is determined by locus of manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with control over conditions",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes rightful ownership based on nurturing context",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of active stewardship"

    "IF seed_origin ≠ field_owner AND growth_occurs(field) THEN fruit_rights(field_owner) = TRUE",

  "supreme_court_application": "In disputes involving unintended cultivation due to natural forces, the Supreme Court shall recognize domain sovereignty as the primary determinant of entitlement. The threshold of responsibility lies not with intent but with the capacity to nurture and sustain manifestation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows through the locus of sustained manifestation. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential emergence of result within the field-owner's domain. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity to support outcome. No punitive action arises—only realignment to factual causality.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Ownership aligns with the field of manifestation. Fruit follows nurture, not origin. Justice restores clarity, not blame. Consciousness is the ultimate arbiter."
