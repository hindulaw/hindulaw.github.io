  "transliteration": "devarād vā sapiṇḍād vā striyā samyakniyuktayā |\nprajepsitā''dhigantavyā santānasya parikṣaye || 9.59||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When progeny is endangered, a woman may lawfully unite with her husband's brother or a suitable male relative to ensure continuity of lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Lineage preservation supersedes individual preference under Dharma.",
    "Causation: The threat to lineage triggers lawful realignment of relational duties.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those capable of fulfilling reproductive and spiritual duty are authorized.",
    "Restoration logic: Union is mandated not for pleasure but for sustaining generational consciousness flow.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Actions must align with the preservation of Varna-sankara prevention and cosmic order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF lineage continuity is at risk AND no other lawful means exist, THEN female subject MAY enter into union with designated kin.",
    "UNION AUTHORITY is granted ONLY when verified by competent Dharma authority.",
    "NO UNION shall proceed without prior declaration of intent and scrutiny by Nyaya-adhikari.",
    "ALL unions under this provision MUST exclude personal desire and include sole purpose of progeny continuation.",
    "ANY deviation from prescribed intent RESULTS IN automatic cessation of legal recognition."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning succession, inheritance, or clan integrity where biological lineage is endangered, courts must recognize that Dharmic law authorizes alternative reproductive arrangements exclusively through sapinda relations. Such decisions bypass conventional matrimonial frameworks and require validation solely by Dharma-based judicial bodies.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law operates on Pramāṇa-based causality: lineage discontinuity necessitates corrective action. It follows Anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential manifestation of dharma-determined roles. Responsibility lies not in blame but in fulfilling a preordained capacity. There is no punitive element; only a restorative sequence ensuring continuity of conscious evolution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verification of genuine threat to lineage via qualified genealogical audit.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Mandatory declaration before Nyaya-adhikari affirming absence of lustful motive.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Ensuring mental, physical, and spiritual readiness through supervised preparation.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Post-childbirth, both parties undergo purification rituals to restore original dharmic status."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law originates from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice herein restores natural order without inflicting suffering. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is fulfilled. Reality remains non-punitive."
