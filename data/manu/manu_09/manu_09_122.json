  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a younger son is born to an elder mother and an elder son is born to a younger mother, and doubt arises regarding their division of inheritance, then the order of birth determines precedence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF two sons claim inheritance where maternal seniority opposes paternal seniority THEN the son born first shall be granted priority in distribution",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that birth order is the valid means of determining succession. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility flows naturally from sequential manifestation.
