  "transliteration": "saṅkramadhvajayaṣṭīnāṃ pratimānāṃ ca bhedakaḥ |\npratikuryācca tatsarvaṃ pañca dadyātśatāni ca || 9.285||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who causes division among consecrated flags, sacrificial ladles, images, or sacred emblems shall restore all damages by offering five hundred units of restitution.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consecration and divine sanction",
    "Causation is established through conscious intent to disrupt unity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from access to sacred elements",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional energetic compensation",
    "Consciousness alignment demands reverence for consecrated symbols"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent disrupts consecrated objects THEN initiate completion process",
    "IF damage involves sacred symbols THEN restitution = 500 units",
    "IF intent is proven THEN assume full responsibility ELSE assign corrective education protocol",
    "IF restoration occurs THEN update societal integrity ledger",
    "IF recurrence detected THEN escalate consciousness alignment intervention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations involving desecration or disruption of consecrated articles, the Supreme Court must evaluate the actor's capacity, intent, and impact on collective spiritual coherence. Responsibility thresholds are determined by proximity to and interference with divinely sanctioned instruments. Remediation precedes judgment; punitive measures are constitutionally invalid.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that disruption of sacred unity manifests as measurable energetic distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential degradation caused by such acts. Proportional responsibility aligns with the quantum of disturbance. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering cannot be imposed—it must be transcended through conscious correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate ritual re-consecration of affected symbols",
    "Assign offender to perform service in maintenance of sacred spaces",
    "Implement consciousness education program focused on reverence and unity",
    "Require public acknowledgment and energetic restoration offering",
    "Verify completion through community attestation and spiritual validation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored when unity prevails over division. Reality remains non-punitive when consciousness awakens to its own supremacy. Judgment belongs solely to the awakened Self."
