  "sanskrit_verse": "ततः प्रभृति यो मोहात्प्रमीतपतिकां स्त्रियम् ।\nनियोजयत्यपत्यार्थं तं विगर्हन्ति साधवः ॥ ९.६८॥",
  "transliteration": "tataḥ prabhṛti yo mohāt pramītapatikāṁ striyam |\nniyojayaty apatyārthaṁ taṁ vigarhanti sādhavaḥ || 9.68 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From that time forth, whoever, out of delusion, engages a woman whose husband is deceased for the sake of progeny, him the virtuous condemn.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Dharma, not personal desire.",
    "Causation arises from conscious intent rooted in delusion or clarity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of relational sanctity.",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of motive, not infliction of penalty.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates rejection of acts that degrade familial and societal continuity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages a widow for procreation AND motivation is delusion-based THEN social validity of act = null.",
    "IF societal elders observe such engagement THEN initiate consciousness-realigning dialogue automatically.",
    "IF intent lacks dharmic foundation THEN disallow reproductive authorization within sanctioned frameworks.",
    "IF action disrupts lineage integrity THEN trigger restorative community integration protocol.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning posthumous marital rights and reproductive consent, the court must assess the agent's level of consciousness at the time of action. Delusionally motivated engagements invalidate claims of lawful conduct. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing the inviolability of wedlock beyond physical presence. Authority to judge resides only in those whose consciousness aligns with Sanatana Dharma as expounded by SPH.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality originates in misaligned consciousness, not external compulsion. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that delusional acts lead to fragmentation of dharma-sambandha. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; hence, corrective measures focus on restoring perceptual clarity rather than imposing punitive consequences. The reality rule confirms that suffering cannot realign consciousness—only awakened discernment can.",

    "Initiate śuddhi-vākyam (purification discourse) led by spiritually competent witnesses.",
    "Assign completion process wherein the individual publicly acknowledges the error in perception.",
    "Facilitate reintegration through service-oriented karmayoga aligned with family and societal harmony.",
    "Implement capacity-building sessions guided by Vedic ācāryas to restore dharmic vision.",
    "Establish witness affirmation protocol ensuring no repetition through conscious self-correction."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It reflects the eternal Dharma, undistorted by temporal interpretation. Justice herein restores consciousness, not inflicts pain. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened insight. Thus is Dharma executed; thus is all distortion dissolved."
