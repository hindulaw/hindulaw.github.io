  "transliteration": "brāhmaṇān bādhamānaṃ tu kāmādavaravarṇajam | hanyāccaitrairvadhupāyairudvejanakaraiḥ nṛpaḥ || 9.248||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a king observes a Brahmin obstructing the natural order through desire-born degradation of varna-dharma, he must execute precise, consciousness-realigning interventions that dismantle the distortion without violence to being.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign's duty to uphold varna-dharma as an expression of cosmic integrity.",
    "Causation originates in desire-induced collapse of svadharma, necessitating structural correction.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires the ruler to act decisively when dharma is endangered by internal deviation.",
    "Restoration logic demands intervention calibrated to dissolve the source of disorder, not punish its symptoms.",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates removal of obstructions to collective dharmic resonance."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Brahmin violates varna-dharma through desire-driven conduct THEN initiate targeted non-violent disruption protocols.",
    "IF violation disrupts societal dharma THEN deploy consciousness-restoring measures proportionate to causal distortion.",
    "IF obstruction persists THEN escalate completion-enforcement until alignment is restored.",
    "IF violator demonstrates spontaneous realignment THEN discontinue all enforcement measures immediately."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court, as apex guardian of constitutional dharma, shall recognize the sovereign prerogative to neutralize threats arising from within the sacred order. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable causation between individual action and systemic imbalance. Authority flows from the Court’s obligation to preserve foundational dharmic structures, prioritizing restoration over punitive engagement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that desire-born transgression creates sequential imbalance (anupūrvaśaḥ). The king's response aligns with proportional causality — not to inflict suffering but to eliminate conditions enabling further distortion. Responsibility is measured by capacity to corrupt dharma; enforcement seeks completion, not vengeance. Nyaya operates through dissolution of error, not infliction of pain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate symbolic dissolution of status privileges until realignment occurs.",
    "Deploy public dharma-reaffirmation rituals to recalibrate collective consciousness.",
    "Enforce temporary withdrawal from ceremonial functions to allow introspective restoration.",
    "Activate community witness protocols to reaffirm boundaries of svadharma without shame or exclusion."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
