  "transliteration": "avidyānāṁ tu sarveṣām īhātaś ced dhanaṁ bhavet |\nsamastatra vibhāgaḥ syād apitrya iti dhāraṇā || 9.205 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When wealth arises from the efforts of all individuals in a state of ignorance, that wealth shall be collectively shared without claim of ownership or inheritance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from collective participation, not individual assertion.",
    "Causation is distributed among all contributing agents regardless of conscious intent.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires equitable access to resources derived from mutual effort.",
    "Restoration logic demands dissolution of proprietary claims where origin is non-individual.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates removal of possessive identification in shared creation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF wealth is generated through collective action AND no single agent holds exclusive causal capacity THEN ownership rights default to communal distribution.",
    "IF an asset's genesis includes untraceable or multi-source contributions THEN inheritance claims SHALL NOT apply.",
    "WHEN ignorance obscures true causality of acquisition THEN restitution defaults to universal accessibility.",
    "ALL economic entitlements MUST be evaluated against the threshold of demonstrable individual causative agency."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving assets with indeterminate origins rooted in collective societal contribution, the Supreme Court must prioritize dissolution of proprietary constructs and enforce equitable redistribution. Responsibility thresholds are determined by verifiable causal agency, not inherited or asserted dominion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that when causal threads cannot be individually traced, ownership dissolves by ontological necessity. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that accumulation based on false individuation leads to distortion; hence, proportional responsibility aligns with factual causality. There is no punitive consequence—only realignment to dharma-sustained equity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: Identify all parties involved in the generation of disputed wealth and establish their actualized contribution levels.",
    "Implement assumption protocol: Require relinquishment of false proprietorship and adoption of shared stewardship model.",
    "Restore capacity: Ensure equal access to benefits arising from previously misattributed assets.",
    "Reintegrate integrity: Facilitate public acknowledgment of erroneous possession and voluntary correction."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling restores Dharma by dissolving false ownership rooted in ignorance. Justice flows not through punishment but through consciousness-aligned realignment. Wealth born of undifferentiated effort returns to its universal source. Reality abides in non-punitivity. Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
