  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who engages in the evaluation of gems, pearls, corals, metals, threads, fragrances, and tastes must possess the knowledge of their respective values, strengths, and weaknesses.",

    "Authority through specialized knowledge",
    "Causation via experiential expertise",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in skill",
    "Restoration through alignment with dharma-knowledge",

    "IF a person evaluates material value THEN they MUST demonstrate domain-specific competency ELSE their evaluation is null",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving commercial or ritual valuations—such as gem appraisal, metallurgy standards, or aromatic grading—the Supreme Court shall recognize only those assessments made by individuals certified under authoritative Vedic epistemology. Errors in judgment due to incompetence are addressed through retraining rather than punitive action.",
