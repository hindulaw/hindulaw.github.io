  "sanskrit_verse": "एतावानेव पुरुषो यत्जायाऽत्मा प्रजैति ह ।\nविप्राः प्राहुस्तथा चैतद्यो भर्ता सा स्मृताङ्गना ॥ ९.४५॥",
  "transliteration": "etāvāna eva puruṣo yad jāyātmā prajaiti ha | viprāḥ prāhur atha caitad yo bhartā sā smṛtāṅganā || 9.45 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The man alone is the procreator of offspring through his wife; such is the declaration of the knowers of Dharma: she whose protector and supporter he is, that woman is called 'his own' (aṅganā).",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious capacity to sustain and protect",
    "Causation flows from the active male principle in procreation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns guardianship to the husband",
    "Restoration logic aligns familial roles with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of inherent relational duties"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a male has taken responsibility for protection and sustenance of a female THEN legal recognition of marital bond is established",
    "IF procreation occurs under mutual consent within recognized union THEN both parties bear proportional completion responsibilities",
    "IF a man assumes guardianship of a woman's well-being THEN societal and legal acknowledgment of anganā status applies",
    "IF relational integrity breaks down THEN restoration protocols activate prior to any external adjudication"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning marriage and family law, the threshold of responsibility lies in the demonstrable assumption of protective and generative duty by the husband. The court shall recognize anganā status based on lived relational integrity rather than mere ceremonial form. Legal standing derives from alignment with Dharma-tattva, not procedural formalism.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through the husband's role in procreation and protection. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that disruption in this relational axis manifests as social disharmony. Responsibility is assigned proportionally without punitive intent. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment invites correction via consciousness-realizing processes, not suffering-based consequences.",
