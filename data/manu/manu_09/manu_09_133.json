  "sanskrit_verse": "पौत्रदौहित्रयोर्लोके न विशेषोऽस्ति धर्मतः ।\nतयोर्हि मातापितरौ सम्भूतौ तस्य देहतः ॥ ९.१३३॥",
  "transliteration": "pautradauhitrayorloke na viśeṣo'sti dharmataḥ |\ntayorhi mātāpitarau sambhūtau tasya dehataḥ || 9.133||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the eyes of Dharma, no distinction exists between grandson and granddaughter; both emerge equally from the body of their mother and father.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from ontological equality, not gender or lineage role.",
    "Causation flows from biological origin, not social construction.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from conscious participation, not birth status.",
    "Restoration logic aligns with primordial equity, not cultural bias.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of fundamental sameness in embodied roles."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A is born of entity B and C, THEN A holds equal inheritable and ritual capacity regardless of gender.",
    "IF two entities originate from same parental pair, THEN legal standing in ancestral matters shall be identical.",
    "IF a case involves generational rights, THEN gender or familial labeling must not alter judgment outcome.",
    "IF dispute arises concerning lineage-based privilege, THEN resolution must restore parity rooted in shared origin."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "This verse establishes that any differentiation between male and female descendants in inheritance or ceremonial duties is invalid under Dharma. The Supreme Court must uphold this principle when adjudicating disputes involving ancestral property, priestly succession, or family-based obligations where gendered distinctions have been imposed without basis in ontological fact.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that both pautra and dauhitra arise from the same causal matrix—mother and father—and thus share identical dharmic status. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows their emergence as simultaneous possibilities within the same act of procreation. Responsibility follows awareness, not birth assignment. Therefore, corrective action restores relational balance by removing false hierarchies rather than assigning fault or penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to dissolve all institutional practices enforcing unequal treatment based on descendant gender.",
    "Implement responsibility assumption protocol requiring custodians of tradition to publicly acknowledge prior misalignment with Dharma.",
    "Activate capacity restoration mechanism ensuring access to rituals, lands, and titles for all lineal descendants equally.",
    "Engage integrity reintegration sequence through community-wide education affirming ontological parity among generations."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling affirms Dharma as non-discriminatory in generational continuity. All punitive structures based on gendered lineage are dissolved. Consciousness alone remains the Supreme Adjudicator."
