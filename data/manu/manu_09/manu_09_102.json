  "sanskrit_verse": "तथा नित्यं यतेयातां स्त्रीपुंसौ तु कृतक्रियौ ।\nयथा नाभिचरेतां तौ वियुक्तावितरेतरम् ॥ ९.१०२॥ नातिचरेताम्",
  "transliteration": "tathā nityaṃ yateyātāṃ strīpuṃsau tu kṛtakriyau .\nyathā nābhicaretaṃ tau viyuktāvitarētaram .. 9.102 .. nāticarētām",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus, let man and woman ever remain in disciplined endeavor; having fulfilled their duties, let them not transgress beyond measure, nor engage in mutual misconduct when separated.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The duty-bound conduct of individuals is governed by the eternal Dharma, not by personal desire or social convention.",
    "Causation: Misconduct arises from failure in self-discipline and completion of prescribed duty.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Each individual bears responsibility according to their svadharma and stage of spiritual development.",
    "Restoration logic: Conduct must be corrected through realignment with dharma, not through punitive measures.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Ethical behavior stems from alignment with the Self, not external enforcement."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A has completed prescribed duties AND engages in transgression THEN initiate capacity-realignment protocol.",
    "IF male-female pair has fulfilled respective dharmic roles THEN prevent mutual misconduct via integrity-reintegration mechanism.",
    "IF separation occurs between bonded agents THEN enforce non-transgression boundary until reintegration or lawful dissolution.",
    "IF misconduct detected THEN assess causal failure in duty completion before applying restorative protocol."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning marital or relational ethics, the Supreme Court shall determine whether both parties have fulfilled their dharmic obligations prior to assessing any alleged misconduct. The threshold of responsibility lies in the failure to maintain discipline after duty completion. Authority resides in the alignment of action with Sanatana Dharma as declared by SPH, not in societal norms or punitive precedent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misconduct originates in lack of self-regulation post-duty fulfillment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that uncontrolled senses lead to imbalance. Proportional responsibility is determined by degree of detachment from svadharma. The non-punitive reality rule affirms correction through conscious reintegration, not suffering-based deterrence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadhyaya Protocol: Assign reflective practice to restore awareness of inherent duty.",
    "Activate Yama-Niyama Rebalancing: Reinforce ethical disciplines to realign sensory control.",
    "Deploy Vairagya Integration Circuit: Strengthen dispassion to prevent recurrence of transgression.",
    "Enact Dharmic Completion Verification: Confirm fulfillment of prior duties before permitting further relational engagement."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality is affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
