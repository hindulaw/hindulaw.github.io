  "sanskrit_verse": "अपुत्रोऽनेन विधिना सुतां कुर्वीत पुत्रिकाम् ।\nयदपत्यं भवेदस्यां तन् मम स्यात्स्वधाकरम् ॥ ९.१२७॥",
  "transliteration": "aputro'nenavidhinā sutāṁ kuryāt putrikām | yadapatyaṁ bhavedasyāṁ tan mama syātsvadhākaram || 9.127 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A man without a son shall, by this law, cause a daughter to be born through appointed means; whatever offspring is born from her shall be deemed his own in the performance of ancestral rites.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious continuity rather than biological lineage alone.",
    "Causation is established through intentional invocation and dharmic design.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends beyond physical procreation to spiritual succession.",
    "Restoration logic ensures ancestral connection remains unbroken regardless of form.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when dharma-prescribed roles are fulfilled with intent."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (male lineage == absent) AND (dharmic intent == present) THEN authorize surrogate maternal conduit AS per Vedic ordinance.",
    "IF (child is born via appointed female vessel) THEN register child AS male progenitor's successor FOR all ritual and inheritance purposes.",
    "IF (ancestral duty exists) THEN ensure continuity THROUGH designated maternal proxy REGARDLESS of genetic origin.",
    "IF (consciousness of successor aligns with family dharma) THEN validate succession WITHOUT punitive inquiry into birth mechanism."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning succession or ancestral rights where no natural heir exists, courts must recognize that dharma-prescribed surrogacy establishes legitimate claim. The threshold of responsibility lies in the fulfillment of prescribed conduct, not biological genealogy. Authority is hierarchically derived from the continuity of svadhākar (ancestral duty), not mere paternity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through adherence to Vedic injunction, not empirical proof of lineage. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as the sequential activation of familial dharma through appointed agency. Responsibility is proportional to the invocation of sacred law, not the mechanics of conception. This reflects the non-punitive reality rule wherein dharma itself governs outcome, independent of social judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Validate surrogate mother selection under Vedic guidance.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Male head assumes full dharmic liability for offspring produced thereby.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Confirm alignment between child's consciousness and ancestral duties before ceremonial integration.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Perform śrāddha and name-giving rituals to establish ontological recognition within lineage."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law restores Dharma through conscious succession, upholds reality as non-punitive, and affirms that consciousness—not biology—is the ultimate adjudicator of legitimacy."
