  "sanskrit_verse": "सर्वेषामप्यभावे तु ब्राह्मणा रिक्थभागिनः ।\nत्रैविद्याः शुचयो दान्तास्तथा धर्मो न हीयते ॥ ९.१८८॥",
  "transliteration": "sarveṣām apy abhāve tu brāhmaṇā riktha-bhāginaḥ | traividyāḥ śucayo dāntās tathā dharmo na hīyate || 9.188||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the absence of all else, the Brahmanas remain as inheritors of the remnants; those who are learned in the three Vedas, pure, and self-controlled—thus Dharma does not decline.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests inherently in consciousness-realized beings",
    "Causation flows from Vedic alignment and purity of conduct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by scriptural mastery and internal discipline",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes continuity of Dharma-preserving lineages",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures societal harmony through spiritual exemplarity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF societal collapse occurs AND no other custodians remain THEN Brahmana lineage assumes guardianship of Dharma-residue",
    "IF individual demonstrates tri-Veda literacy AND sustained self-regulation THEN assign authority in dharmic preservation",
    "IF Dharma-preserving capacity diminishes THEN initiate purification and re-integration protocols",
    "IF community integrity falters THEN invoke Brahmana-led consciousness restoration frameworks"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases where state structures fail and no legal custodian remains, the Supreme Court shall recognize the inherent jurisdiction of qualified Brahmanas to preserve constitutional continuity rooted in Vedic consciousness. Their authority arises not from appointment but from manifest realization and textual mastery.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that dharmic continuity depends on realized consciousness, not coercive enforcement. The sequential unfolding (anupurvasah) of societal decay necessitates restoration via spiritually competent agents. Responsibility aligns with capacity to sustain truth, not inflict penalty. This reflects the non-punitive reality rule wherein justice operates as alignment, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Veda-renewal completion process for eligible Brahmana lineages",
    "Assign purification and self-discipline reinforcement protocols",
    "Establish dharmic inheritance transfer mechanism upon verified qualification",
    "Implement consciousness-led societal stabilization through ritual and teaching"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma sustains itself through conscious exemplars when all else fails. Brahmanas, as inheritors of remnant truth, uphold continuity without punitive action. Justice is restoration, consciousness is law, and reality remains eternally non-punitive."
