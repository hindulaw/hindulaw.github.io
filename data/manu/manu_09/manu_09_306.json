  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रविश्य सर्वभूतानि यथा चरति मारुतः । तथा चारैः प्रवेष्टव्यं व्रतमेतधि मारुतम् ॥ ९.३०६॥",
  "transliteration": "praviśya sarvabhūtāni yathā carati mārutaḥ | tathā cāraiḥ praveṣṭavyaṁ vratam etadhi mārutam || 9.306 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Just as the wind enters all beings and moves through them without attachment, so too must one conduct oneself with the discipline of the air—free from clinging, unobstructed, and aligned with the movement of dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with natural law, not coercion",
    "Causation is non-local and operates through consciousness-field dynamics",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mastery over internal rather than external conditions",
    "Restoration logic follows the principle of non-obstruction and harmonious flow",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates obstruction in consciousness-flow THEN initiate re-alignment protocol via breath-awareness restoration",
    "IF entity acts with clinging or possessiveness THEN deploy non-attachment completion process",
    "IF behavior disrupts dharma-field equilibrium THEN invoke prana-based integrity reset",
    "IF individual exhibits misaligned action THEN assess capacity for inner mobility before assigning corrective measure"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies not in intent or consequence alone but in the degree of alignment with the unobstructed flow of dharma. The court must evaluate whether an actor has cultivated the capacity to move like the wind—without residue or fixation—and apply restoration protocols accordingly.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true causality resides in the alignment of consciousness with the field. As the wind moves without distortion, so must judgment proceed without punitive residue. Responsibility unfolds sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ) based on one's capacity to embody the vow of non-clinging. Retribution dissolves where awareness governs action.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vayu Sādhanā Completion Process to restore non-attached movement",
    "Deploy Prāṇa Alignment Monitoring for 21-day integration cycle",
    "Assign Consciousness Mobility Audit under qualified ācārya supervision",
    "Establish Field Residue Clearance Protocol using śūnya-based meditation techniques"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through alignment with the vow of the wind. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
