  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One appointed to a widow, having performed the rite with clarified butter and spoken the vow at night, shall produce only one son—never a second under any condition.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through ritualized appointment by qualified lineage holders.",
    "Causation is established via sacramental acts aligned with Vedic injunctions.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by adherence to prescribed rites and temporal boundaries.",
    "Restoration logic ensures continuity of lineage without excess or imbalance.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires precise execution within dharmic parameters."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent is appointed to a widow AND performs ghrita initiation AND speaks vow at night THEN ALLOW generation of one male heir ONLY.",
    "IF number of generated heirs exceeds one THEN BLOCK further reproductive entitlements FOR that agent.",
    "IF agent fails to perform ghrita initiation OR vow THEN NULLIFY reproductive authorization.",
    "IF unauthorized second conception occurs THEN trigger consciousness-realignment protocol for involved parties."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning posthumous procreation or surrogate lineage, the Court must affirm that reproductive entitlement arises solely from ritually authorized appointment. Any deviation beyond the singular authorized outcome constitutes actionable misalignment subject to restorative judicial review, not punitive sanction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes cause through observance of ritual form; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests in sequential compliance with Vedic procedure; proportional responsibility lies in limiting outcome to one life-event; non-punitive reality rule enforces cessation of entitlement upon completion of lawful intent.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Confirm fulfillment of initial authorized conception.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Realign involved consciousness to original dharmic contract.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Withdraw reproductive license where violated.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Reinforce understanding of Vedic limits among lineage holders."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. The Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions."
