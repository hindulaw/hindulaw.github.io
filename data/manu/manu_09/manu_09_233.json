  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which has been completed and instructed in any place or time according to Dharma, having known it as performed rightly, one should not cause it to be undone again.",

    "Restoration logic prioritizes continuity over revision unless fundamental misalignment occurs",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring the perfected state of dharmic acts"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a legal act is determined to be in accordance with Dharma AND has reached its natural conclusion THEN no further reversal or retrial shall occur",
