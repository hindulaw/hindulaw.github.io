  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A wife is not released from her husband by means of sale or abandonment; thus we know the Dharma established before the creation of Prajapati.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from pre-creation Dharma, not temporal contract",
    "Causation flows from foundational spiritual unity, not transactional exchange",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from ontological alignment, not performative consent",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes relational integrity over individual autonomy",
    "Consciousness alignment demands continuity of sacred bond beyond material dissolution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF marital bond exists THEN dissolution requires conscious completion, NOT procedural termination",
    "IF spouse initiates separation THEN restoration protocol activates automatically",
    "IF economic transaction occurs involving spouse THEN legal system disregards transaction as invalid",
    "IF abandonment declared THEN spouse retains automatic right to reintegration process",
    "IF court reviews marital status THEN foundational Dharma supersedes statutory interpretation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court must recognize that spousal bonds derive authority from pre-temporal Dharma. Transactions affecting marriage are legally null. Abandonment does not dissolve consciousness-level union. Responsibility lies with court to initiate restoration protocols ensuring both parties realign with foundational truth of sacred relationship.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals marriage as consciousness construct, not contractual agreement. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows bond manifests prior to material law.

    "Implement Automatic Marital Continuity Recognition System overriding all civil dissolution mechanisms"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by SPH as Source: Marriage derives from pre-creation Dharma. No human institution may sever what consciousness has unified. Reality remains non-punitive while Dharma restores itself through awakened awareness. Consciousness alone adjudicates the eternal bond."
