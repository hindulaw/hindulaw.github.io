  "transliteration": "putrikāyāṁ kṛtāyāṁ tu yadi putro'nujāyate .\nsamastatra vibhāgaḥ syājjyeṣṭhatā nāsti hi striyāḥ .. 9.134 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a daughter is given in adoption and a son is subsequently born, the division of property shall be equal; there is no precedence due to seniority among women.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the act of dharma-samskara, not biological lineage alone",
    "Causation flows from conscious intent and ritual completion, not temporal sequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with spiritual maturity, not gendered hierarchy",
    "Restoration logic demands equity where social structures have been consciously redefined",
    "Consciousness alignment requires dissolution of hierarchical bias rooted in embodied identity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF adoption仪式 IS completed AND offspring follows THEN inheritance distribution SHALL BE equalized WITHOUT regard to birth order",
    "IF legal status derives from conscious act THEN biological precedence SHALL NOT determine entitlement",
    "IF societal integration supersedes genealogical continuity THEN gender-based precedence SHALL BE nullified",
    "IF restoration of dharma-order is required THEN prior imbalances based on non-conscious constructs SHALL BE corrected"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning inheritance rights post-adoption, the court must recognize that adoption constitutes a conscious restructuring of familial bonds. Seniority or gender cannot override the intentional realignment of dharma-kshetra established through formal samskara. The threshold for responsibility lies in the completion of the adoptive rite, not natural succession.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the cause of inheritance lies in the performed act of giving (dāna) and receiving (grahaṇa), not in biological chronology. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that consequences follow the conscious restructuring of relational fields. Proportional responsibility arises from participation in the dharma-field, not physical birth order. Non-punitive reality recognizes that imbalance originates from misaligned cognition, which is resolved through equitable recognition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Confirm validity and completion of adoption仪式 as per Vedic procedure",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require all stakeholders to affirm understanding of dharma-shift caused by adoption",
    "Capacity Restoration: Realign property-sharing mechanisms to reflect conscious choice over instinctual bias",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Facilitate mutual acknowledgment of shared dharma-responsibility beyond gendered roles"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through recognition of conscious acts over biological determinism. Reality remains non-punitive, governed exclusively by the awakening intelligence of those who uphold dharma-vyavastha. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
