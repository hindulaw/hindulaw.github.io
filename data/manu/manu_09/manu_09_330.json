  "transliteration": "bījānām uptivid ca syāt kṣetradōṣaguṇasya ca | mānayōgaṃ ca jānīyāt tulāyogāṃś ca sarvaśaḥ || 9.330 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who knows the nature of seeds, the qualities and defects of soil, measurement standards, and all forms of weighing shall govern agricultural and commercial transactions with precision and integrity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from knowledge of causal factors",
    "Causation arises through understanding foundational elements",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mastery of relevant domains",
    "Restoration logic aligns with accurate measurement and classification",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action reflects true understanding"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a transaction involves measurable goods THEN only those trained in standardized units MAY authorize exchange",
    "IF soil condition affects yield THEN land assessment MUST precede cultivation rights assignment",
    "IF seed quality determines outcome THEN certification by knowledgeable agent IS required prior to planting",
    "IF weight or measure discrepancy detected THEN automatic suspension of trade authorization UNTIL recalibration completed",
    "IF capacity to judge agricultural/commercial value absent THEN delegation to competent authority MANDATORY"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning agrarian law, commercial weights and measures, or environmental impact on productivity, the threshold of responsibility lies exclusively with those possessing direct experiential and technical knowledge. The court must ensure no decision affecting these domains proceeds without validation from such recognized authorities.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that outcomes stem from correct identification of seed, soil, scale, and method. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that misalignment at any stage manifests systemic distortion. Proportional responsibility rests not on blame but on recalibration of awareness. Non-punitive reality rule affirms correction as natural consequence of truth recognition.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. Justice flows exclusively through consciousness realignment, never through punitive imposition. Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
