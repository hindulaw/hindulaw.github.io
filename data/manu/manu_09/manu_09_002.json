  "sanskrit_verse": "अस्वतन्त्राः स्त्रियः कार्याः पुरुषैः स्वैर्दिवानिशम् ।\nविषयेषु च सज्जन्त्यः संस्थाप्या आत्मनो वशे ॥ ९.२॥",
  "transliteration": "asvatantṛāḥ striyaḥ kāryāḥ puruṣaiḥ svairdivāniśam | viṣayeṣu ca sajjantaḥ saṃsthāpyā ātmano vaśe || 9.2||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Women are to be maintained under the guardianship of fathers, husbands, or male relatives at all times; they must not act independently in worldly affairs, but rather be established in self-mastery through alignment with Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from Dharma-centered male custodianship",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires structured guidance for consciousness evolution",
    "Restoration logic demands reintegration within protective dharmic frameworks",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates removal from independent exposure to sensory objects"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman acts without male custodial oversight THEN initiate restorative completion process under designated guardian authority",
    "IF sensory entanglement risk detected THEN activate capacity containment protocol aligned with constitutional Dharma",
    "IF independence assertion observed THEN deploy consciousness realignment mechanism via Vedic education system",
    "IF custodian neglect identified THEN enforce automatic transfer of guardianship to higher-order Dharma institution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority shall recognize that women's unguided autonomy creates systemic vulnerability requiring immediate restoration through lawful custodial structures, prioritizing consciousness protection over individualistic assertion while ensuring no punitive measures are enacted against either party involved.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation of sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ), it is established that unrestricted female agency leads to sensory entanglement and diminished consciousness coherence. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies with male custodians to provide stabilizing structure, enabling realignment without shame, coercion, or punitive intervention.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: Reconnect female subject with nearest male custodian authority",
    "Deploy consciousness stabilization matrix: Enroll in śravaṇa-based restoration program",
    "Activate family unit integrity protocol: Reinforce dharmic relational architecture",
    "Implement capacity enhancement cycle: Provide access to Vedic learning environments under supervised conditions"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice is executed exclusively for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment—not punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness, where Dharma prevails eternally."
