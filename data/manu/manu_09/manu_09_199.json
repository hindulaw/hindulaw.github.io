  "transliteration": "na nirhāraṁ striyaḥ kuryuḥ kuṭumbād bahumadhyagāt |\nsvakād api ca vittādhi svasya bharturanājñayā || 9.199 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A woman shall not make any independent financial transaction or disposal of property without the explicit consent of her husband, even if she possesses personal wealth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the designated guardian or protector within familial and economic structures.",
    "Causation is tied to relational integrity and structural alignment, not individual autonomy alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is context-bound and flows through established dharmic hierarchies.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes harmony and coherence within relational units before individual assertion.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring role-specific duties that sustain collective dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman initiates a financial transaction WITHOUT husband's explicit consent THEN system flags action AS structurally invalid.",
    "IF woman possesses personal wealth BUT resides under husband’s protection THEN all asset movements REQUIRE joint acknowledgment.",
    "IF transaction occurs without spousal consent THEN automatic suspension of transfer until confirmation protocol completes.",
    "IF no conflict exists in household authority structure THEN woman may manage her own income WITH notification rights retained by husband."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning marital property rights, the Supreme Court must recognize that authority flows from relational alignment rather than abstract ownership. The threshold for legal validity includes verification of hierarchical consent where such structures are operative under Sanatana Dharma. This ensures preservation of family unity and prevents fragmentation caused by autonomous financial actions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that relational roles determine transactional legitimacy. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that disruption arises when sequence of consent is violated. Responsibility lies not in fault but in realigning the causal chain. No punitive consequence attaches; only completion of proper procedure restores balance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process with both parties to reaffirm consent pathways.",
    "Reintegrate financial decision-making through guided dialogue ensuring mutual understanding.",
    "Support capacity-building for aligned future transactions via structured awareness sessions.",
    "Verify internalized respect for relational roles while preserving individual dignity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
