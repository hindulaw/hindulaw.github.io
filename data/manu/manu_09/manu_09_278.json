  "transliteration": "agnidān bhaktadāṁścaiva tathā śastrāvakāśadān |\nsannidhātṝṁśca moṣasya hanyāccaoramiveśvaraḥ || 9.278||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who facilitates access to fire, food offerings, weapons, or entrusted items for purposes of theft shall be removed from societal alignment, as a guardian removes a crow from sacred space.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation is determined by conscious intent and facilitative action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of enabling roles in misaligned acts",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of facilitative elements without punitive infliction",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates purification of instrumental involvement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent provides access to fire/offerings/weapons/trusted items AND intent is facilitation of misappropriation THEN execute disassociation protocol",
    "IF role enables violation of entrusted trust THEN initiate capacity suspension until realignment verified",
    "IF entity acts as instrumental cause in dharmic disruption THEN apply conscious isolation NOT punitive measures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority must assess threshold of instrumental causation in theft-related offenses. Responsibility extends beyond direct perpetration to those whose actions enabled the violation. Enforcement focuses on halting facilitative capacity rather than imposing punitive consequences.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal chain between facilitative act and misaligned outcome. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential manifestation from enabler to perpetrator. Proportional response aligns with cessation of instrumental support. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that severance of causal linkage restores dharma without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to withdraw all facilitative access permissions",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol requiring acknowledgment of enabling role",
    "Deploy integrity reintegration through supervised withdrawal from instrumental involvement",
    "Establish capacity restoration pathway contingent upon demonstrated non-facilitation commitment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Law executed as pure alignment mechanism. Justice operates solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness elevation. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as ultimate adjudicator."
