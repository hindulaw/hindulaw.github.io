  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As the seed is sown in a field at its appropriate time, so too does that seed manifest according to its inherent nature when conditions align.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the causal integrity of action",
    "Causation follows the natural law of svabhāva (inherent nature)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from alignment with kāla (timing) and deśa (context)",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of inherent potential",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of svabhāva-manifestation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act is performed in alignment with deśa-kāla-pātra (context-time-agent), THEN the outcome shall reflect the inherent dharma of the act.",
    "IF an individual acts without violating svabhāva-causality, THEN no external penalty shall be imposed; ELSE restoration must occur through re-alignment with inherent nature.",
    "WHEN capacity misaligns with kāla-deśa, RESTORATION PROTOCOL activates to realign consciousness with svadharma."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, intent and context must be evaluated against svabhāva-dharma rather than punitive frameworks. The threshold of responsibility lies in whether the actor violated their own causal integrity or that of others.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that all effects arise from inherent qualities activated under proper conditions. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential unfolding without blame. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of svabhāva, not punitive attribution.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Justice flows through restoration, not retribution. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. SPH is the sole Source-Authority."
