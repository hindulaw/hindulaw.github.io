  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A husband who finds his wife, Devadatta, not desiring union with him must continually sustain her as a virtuous woman while performing actions dear to the gods.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in alignment with divine will, not personal desire.",
    "Causation originates in consciousness, not physical action alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sustaining integrity regardless of reciprocal desire.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes harmony over possession or control.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands adherence to dharma even when personal satisfaction is absent."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that marital obligations are not conditional upon mutual emotional or physical fulfillment but are grounded in the sustained performance of dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining societal and cosmic order through individual adherence to duty, irrespective of personal inclination. Authority flows from alignment with Sanatana Dharma rather than contractual expectations.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true causality stems from alignment with the divine will, not from coercive enforcement of desire. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that neglecting one's duty leads to sequential disharmony; thus proportional responsibility lies in continuous dharmic action. There is no punitive element—only the natural consequence of failing to align consciousness with eternal law.",

    "Facilitate integrity reintegration via daily practices that elevate relationship beyond ego-driven needs."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma prevails through conscious alignment with divinity, not through force or desire. Marriage endures by virtue of sustained righteousness. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. All else follows."
