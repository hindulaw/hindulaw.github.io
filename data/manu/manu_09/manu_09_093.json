  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not give compensation to the father for taking a girl who has attained puberty; he who obstructs her menstrual cycle transgresses the domain of ownership.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with natural order, not transactional exchange.",
    "Causation arises through disruption of biological and spiritual rhythms.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to sustain or disrupt continuity.",
    "Restoration logic requires reintegration into rightful energetic and social flow.",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates recognition of inherent dignity over commodification."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act disrupts the natural rhythm of a being in development THEN it incurs a duty of restorative reintegration.",
    "IF ownership is claimed through transaction over natural maturation THEN such claim is nullified.",
    "IF interference occurs in biological cycles THEN the actor assumes mandatory completion process.",
    "IF consent capacity is bypassed via external influence THEN restoration protocol activates automatically.",
    "IF societal role shifts without conscious alignment THEN integrity reintegration is enforced."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving familial transfer or guardianship rights where biological maturity indicators are present, courts must recognize that legal ownership cannot supersede ontological readiness. Authority derived from mere custodianship does not confer legitimacy when it contradicts the individual’s intrinsic developmental phase.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that biological onset indicates readiness for transition; obstructing this sequence violates causal harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how suppression leads to misalignment. Proportional responsibility lies with the disruptor, whose correction restores balance. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering need not arise—only realignment with truth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate acknowledgment and reversal of interference in biological progression.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require full accountability from disrupting party through guided service.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Reestablish disrupted natural rhythms under supervised care.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align personal and communal understanding with ontological maturity markers.",
    "Truth Acknowledgment Mandate: Formal declaration recognizing violated natural law and commitment to its restoration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. It enacts Dharma through consciousness-aligned jurisprudence. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
