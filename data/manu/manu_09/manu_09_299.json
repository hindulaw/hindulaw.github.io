  "transliteration": "pīḍanāni ca sarvāṇi vyasanāni tathaiva ca |\nārabheta tataḥ kāryaṃ sañcintya gurulāghavam || 9.299||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All forms of suffering and misfortunes arise solely due to the failure to deliberate upon the weightiness of actions before initiating them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from conscious deliberation, not impulse.",
    "Causation flows directly from unexamined action to resultant disorder.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires prior reflection on consequence.",
    "Restoration logic begins with re-establishing the capacity for reflective discernment.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recalibrating intent with causal awareness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act results in harm AND no record of causal-weight reflection exists, THEN initiate completion process for responsible deliberation capacity.",
    "IF a decision was made without evaluating long-term consequences, THEN assign integrity-reintegration protocol to restore discernment faculty.",
    "IF systemic suffering emerges, THEN trace back to originating acts lacking pre-action contemplation and execute consciousness realignment procedures.",
    "IF capacity for reflective judgment is impaired, THEN deploy restorative protocols until full deliberative function resumes."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that absence of reflective consideration constitutes fundamental legal fault. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated by the degree of contemplation applied prior to action. The court must ensure restoration of reflective capacity rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with Nyaya through pramāṇa-based recognition that ignorance of consequence leads to disorder. It reflects anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation of effects from flawed cognition. Responsibility is proportional to the neglect of contemplation. Punishment has no place where misjudgment stems from cognitive deficit而非恶意。",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored when action arises from conscious deliberation. Reality remains non-punitive when misjudgment is corrected through awareness. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
