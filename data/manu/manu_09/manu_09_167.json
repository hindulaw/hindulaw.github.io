  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्तल्पजः प्रमीतस्य क्लीबस्य व्याधितस्य वा ।\nस्वधर्मेण नियुक्तायां स पुत्रः क्षेत्रजः स्मृतः ॥ ९.१६७॥",
  "transliteration": "yas talpa-jaḥ pramītasya klībasya vyādhitasya vā |\nsva-dharmeṇa niyuktāyāṁ sa putraḥ kṣetra-jaḥ smṛtaḥ || 9.167 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who is born of the bed of a deceased, impotent, or diseased husband, when the wife is rightfully directed by dharma to bear a child, that son is known as Kshetraja and is recognized as legitimate.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in dharmic directive, not biological lineage alone",
    "Causation is determined through conscious intention aligned with svadharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes reproductive and familial roles within dharma",
    "Restoration logic affirms legitimacy through alignment with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures continuity of spiritual and social inheritance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF husband is deceased OR impotent OR diseased AND wife acts under lawful dharmic instruction THEN offspring is legally recognized as Kshetraja",
    "IF birth occurs via authorized surrogate or appointed means under svadharma THEN legitimacy equals natural patrilineal succession",
    "IF societal role requires continuation of lineage THEN dharma overrides physical incapacity through sanctioned procreative action"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of inheritance, legitimacy, or parental rights involving posthumous, medically assisted, or dharmically sanctioned births, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying alignment with svadharma. Authority flows from conscious adherence to dharma rather than mere biological connection. Courts must recognize Kshetraja status where dharma has been lawfully enacted, ensuring restoration of familial integrity over punitive scrutiny.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through verified dharmic authorization, not emotional or societal judgment. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of intent, sanction, and act confirms the legitimacy of the child without invoking shame or penalty. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the clarity of dharma followed, affirming that reality itself upholds the child's right to belonging when dharma is upheld.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Verification process for dharmic authorization prior to conception",
    "Integration ceremony recognizing the child’s rightful place in lineage",
    "Reaffirmation of family unity through community acknowledgment",
    "Legal documentation confirming Kshetraja status without stigma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source of Dharma. Legitimacy arises from alignment with svadharma, not biology alone. Justice restores the child’s rightful position in the cosmic-social order. Reality enforces through consciousness, never through punishment."
