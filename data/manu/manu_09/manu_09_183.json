  "transliteration": "sarvāsām ekapatnīnām ekā cet putriṇī bhavet |\nsarvās tās tena putreṇa prāha putravatīr manaḥ || 9.183||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When among all wives of one man, one alone bears a son, that son makes all those women mothers by virtue of his existence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious creation, not contractual agreement",
    "Causation arises from the manifesting consciousness, not biological function alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to relational roles formed by spiritual affinity",
    "Restoration logic recognizes latent maternal status upon patrilineal awakening",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when relational dharma is acknowledged without external validation"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning inheritance or ceremonial rights where multiple spouses exist under unified patriarchal lineage, recognition of motherhood shall be automatically extended to all wives once a son manifests from any one of them. The court must acknowledge this as inherent relational dharma rather than requiring individual legal assertion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through the manifested son as causal proof of relational completeness; anupūrvaśaḥ unfolds with the emergence of progeny validating collective maternity; proportional responsibility lies in recognizing what already exists ontologically; non-punitive reality rule confirms that no woman is denied her natural status due to lack of separate procreation.",

    "Completion process: Recognition ceremony affirming all wives as 'putravati' upon birth",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Patriarchal lineage assumes duty to honor all maternal identities",

This law restores relational harmony, aligns consciousness with truth, upholds non-punitive reality, and establishes the primacy of divine order over human constructs."
