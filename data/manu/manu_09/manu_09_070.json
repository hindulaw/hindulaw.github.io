  "transliteration": "yathāvidhyadhigamyaināṁ śuklavastrāṁ śucivratām | mitho bhajetā prasavātsakṛtsakṛdṛtāvṛtau || 9.70||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having lawfully acquired her who is clothed in white garments and devoted to purity, a man and woman shall engage in union only once, at the time of conception, within the ritually prescribed boundaries of dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Union is lawful only when preceded by proper acquisition under dharma",
    "Causation: Sexual union is permitted solely for the purpose of procreation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Both parties must maintain ritual and moral purity",
    "Restoration logic: Violation disrupts cosmic order and requires realignment",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purity of intent and action aligns with dharmic reality"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF union occurs without prior lawful acquisition THEN act is void of dharma",
    "IF union occurs outside procreative intent THEN it violates ritually bounded conduct",
    "IF either party lacks purity in vrata or attire THEN capacity for lawful union is suspended",
    "IF union occurs more than once beyond conception THEN sequential violation manifests",
    "IF all conditions align THEN union sustains dharma and supports conscious evolution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning marital or conjugal conduct, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying conformity to the ritually bounded, procreative framework. Authority resides in dharma-prescribed acquisition and conduct. Retribution has no place; misalignment calls for purification and realignment protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that lawful union arises only upon fulfillment of purity, intent, and ritual capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that repeated or misplaced unions generate sequential disorder. Proportional responsibility is determined by deviation from the singular, procreative purpose. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction restores integrity rather than inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establishment of ritual and moral purity through prescribed vrata",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment and cessation of non-procreative repetition",
    "Capacity Restoration: Re-alignment with dharmic boundaries through guided practice",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public or private affirmation of commitment to dharma-aligned union"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment with ritually pure, procreative union. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone is the supreme adjudicator."
