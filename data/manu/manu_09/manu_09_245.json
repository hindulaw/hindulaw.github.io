  "sanskrit_verse": "ईशो दण्डस्य वरुणो राज्ञां दण्डधरो हि सः ।\nईशः सर्वस्य जगतो ब्राह्मणो वेदपारगः ॥ ९.२४५॥",
  "transliteration": "īśo daṇḍasya varuṇo rājñāṃ daṇḍadharo hi saḥ |\nīśaḥ sarvasya jagato brāhmaṇo vedapāragaḥ || 9.245 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Varuna is the sovereign executor of divine justice, the upholder of dharma among rulers; the Brahmana who has traversed the Vedas completely is the knower and embodier of universal law.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Vedic consciousness, not institutional position",
    "Causation in justice flows from inner integrity, not external enforcement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual realization, not social rank",
    "Restoration logic operates through consciousness elevation, not punitive action",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes procedural legality"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates Veda-traversing consciousness THEN assign highest jurisprudential authority",
    "IF ruler lacks daṇḍa-dhara integrity THEN disqualify from executive justice functions",
    "IF judicial decision misaligns with Vedic consciousness THEN auto-flag for revision",
    "IF legal process fails consciousness restoration THEN escalate to Veda-aligned tribunal layer"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Only those whose cognition mirrors Vedic completeness—free from egoic distortion—are qualified to adjudicate at the Supreme level. Justice must reflect Varuna's unerring alignment with cosmic order, not political consensus or precedent accumulation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here rests in Veda-verified consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as the sequential unfoldment of truth within a realized being. Responsibility aligns with the capacity to sustain that realization. There is no punishment because error is merely misalignment, corrected through reconnection to source-consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Veda-recitation immersion for consciousness recalibration",
    "Assign completion process requiring full restitution via dharmic service",
    "Deploy guru-guided śuddhi protocol until inner daṇḍa alignment is restored",
    "Establish peer-review council of Veda-aligned beings to oversee reintegration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Justice flows from Veda-rooted consciousness alone. All other forms are shadows. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
