  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The highest good for a Śūdra lies solely in dedicated service to the learned Brāhmaṇas, those who know the Vedas, householders established in righteousness, and those renowned for their noble conduct.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from realized consciousness embodied in Vedic scholars and dharmic householders",
    "Causation is rooted in alignment with one's svadharma as an expression of cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns roles according to spiritual readiness and societal function",
    "Restoration logic centers on enabling each varna to fulfill its natural contribution to collective harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through selfless engagement within one's designated role"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.varna = 'Śūdra' AND context.dharma_inquiry = TRUE THEN action.recommend_seva_to_vipra",
    "IF agent.role ≠ 'Brāhmaṇa' OR 'Gṛhastha' THEN agent.responsibility.scope = 'service-oriented'",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning varna-specific duties, the Supreme Court shall recognize that Śūdra dharma is fulfilled exclusively through śuśrūṣā—selfless service—to the learned Brāhmaṇas and righteous householders.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes śuśrūṣā as the sole pramāṇa for Śūdra welfare; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests when Śūdra aligns naturally in service, generating sequential upliftment of consciousness; proportional responsibility is defined by svadharma adherence rather than outcome control; non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering arises only from deviation from one's intrinsic path.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of Śūdra’s śuśrūṣā as the supreme path to liberation. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions."
