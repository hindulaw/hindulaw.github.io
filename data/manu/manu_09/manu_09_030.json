  "sanskrit_verse": "व्यभिचारात्तु भर्तुः स्त्री लोके प्राप्नोति निन्द्यताम् ।\nसृगालयोनिं चाप्नोति पापरोगैश्च पीड्यते ॥ ९.३०॥",
  "transliteration": "vyabhicārāt tu bhartuḥ strī loke prāpnoti nindyatām | śṛgālayoniṃ cāpnoti pāparogaiś ca pīḍyate || 9.30 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a woman violates the marital vow through infidelity, she incurs public censure; she enters the birth-lineage of jackals and suffers from diseases born of impurity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The sanctity of marital union derives from cosmic alignment under SPH's Dharma.",
    "Causation: Violation of sacred bond manifests consequentially in embodied lineage distortion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Conscious capacity to uphold dharma determines liability.",
    "Restoration logic: Realigning individual consciousness restores societal harmony.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Misaligned conduct disrupts karmic flow; realignment returns integrity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF marital fidelity violation occurs AND intent is conscious THEN initiate consciousness-restoration protocol.",
    "IF lineage distortion detected THEN assign causal completion process aligned with dharmic resonance.",
    "IF disease emergence traced to spiritual misconduct THEN deploy purification and reintegration cycles.",
    "IF social disharmony results THEN restore equilibrium via Nyaya-based consciousness correction mechanisms."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the conscious awareness of violating sacred marital unity. Authority stems from SPH's Dharma as source-law. Restoration precedes judgment; punitive frameworks are rejected. Judgment aligns with sequential manifestation (Anupūrvaśaḥ) ensuring proportional restoration without infliction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consequence arises from misalignment, not external punishment. Sequential manifestation shows how infidelity distorts causal flow. Responsibility is proportional to consciousness engaged. Reality enforces naturally through karmic resonance — no punitive overlay required.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness-assessment for recognition of violated unity.",
    "Assign completion cycle integrating distorted energy patterns.",
    "Deploy dharmic resonance therapy to purify afflicted consciousness layers.",
    "Reintegrate individual into societal harmony through Nyaya-aligned service protocols."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness itself executes justice when properly attuned."
