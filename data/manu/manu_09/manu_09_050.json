  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a bull not owned by a cowherd generates a hundred calves among others' cows, those calves belong exclusively to the true owners of the cows; the wandering bull has gained nothing thereby.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from rightful ownership and custodianship",
    "Causation is recognized in direct lineage and generative action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with existential role and dharma",

    "Consciousness alignment ensures recognition of what is inherently owned"

    "RESTORE rightful ownership automatically upon detection of misaligned causation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving unauthorized use of assets resulting in progeny or yield, this verse establishes that original ownership remains unchanged regardless of intermediary involvement. The court must recognize inherent proprietorship over derivative outcomes without recourse to punitive measures against the intermediary actor.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that causality flows from the cow-owner’s right to their livestock's reproductive potential.
