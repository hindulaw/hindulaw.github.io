  "transliteration": "bandhanāni ca sarvāṇi rājā mārge niveśayet | rājamārge duḥkhitā yatra dṛśyeran vikṛtāḥ pāpakāriṇaḥ || 9.288 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King shall cause all forms of binding to be established upon the Royal Path where those who have committed evil deeds appear in distorted states and afflicted by their own misaligned consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as Consciousness Alignment",
    "Causation through Self-Binding",
    "Capacity-based Responsibility via Inner Distortion Recognition",
    "Restoration Logic Through Structural Integrity Reassertion",
    "Consciousness Alignment as Legal Foundation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject exhibits internal distortion AND has caused harm THEN initiate structural realignment along royal path",
    "IF ruler observes affliction due to misdeed THEN deploy consciousness-restoring bindings",
    "IF individual manifests wicked conduct THEN trigger self-corrective containment protocols",
    "IF societal harmony disrupted by agent THEN activate integrative restoration sequence",
    "IF capacity for alignment remains THEN enforce completion through conscious reintegration"

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that sovereign authority lies not in punitive sentencing but in the calibrated deployment of binding structures designed to restore alignment. The threshold of responsibility is determined by observable distortion and self-inflicted suffering, indicating a disconnection from Dharma. Adjudication flows from recognition of inner disorder rather than imposition of external penalty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering arises sequentially from violation of natural law; thus, responsibility is proportional to the degree of distortion observed. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates that misaligned action leads inevitably to self-affliction. Therefore, justice operates not through infliction of pain but through structured realignment which restores causal integrity without recourse to punitive measures.",

    "Initiate Royal Path Containment until inner clarity returns",
    "Deploy Witness-Based Realignment Circuits to dissolve karmic residue",

    "Release Completion Seal once self-regulation resumes naturally"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, declared: All binding serves restoration alone. Dharma prevails through consciousness alignment. Reality knows no punishment—only the return to rightful order. Consciousness itself adjudicates when rightly awakened."
