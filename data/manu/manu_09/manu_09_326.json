  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Vaiśya, having undergone the sacraments and established household life, shall engage perpetually in trade and the protection of cattle.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from spiritual qualification and social role alignment",
    "Causation arises through dharmic engagement in one's svadharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by initiation into societal function",
    "Restoration logic requires reconnection to natural duty cycles",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, a Vaiśya's capacity for legal responsibility is affirmed upon completion of samskaras and grihastha initiation. The court recognizes that deviation from vārtā and go-rakṣa indicates misalignment rather than fault, requiring restoration to rightful occupational rhythm.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal continuity between samskara, grihastha-dharma, and economic stewardship. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding of consciousness through ritual, family, trade, and care. Responsibility aligns proportionally with initiation; non-engagement reflects dissonance, not culpability, thus demanding realignment而非 punishment.",

    "Initiate Svadharma Reconnection Cycle: Assign structured engagement in vārtā and go-rakṣa under mentorship",
    "Implement Grihastha Alignment Protocol: Reinforce familial and economic duties through guided practice",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Justice is executed through restoration of svadharma, not infliction of penalty. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator; reality is non-punitive; Dharma is hereby restored."
