  "transliteration": "vidyādhanaṃ tu yadyasya tattasyaiva dhanaṃ bhavet |\nmaitryamodvāhikaṃ caiva mādhuparkikameva ca || 9.206 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is the wealth of knowledge belongs exclusively to its possessor; likewise, affectionate friendship, nuptial alliance, and ceremonial honor belong only to those who authentically embody them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in direct possession of consciousness-derived capacity",
    "Causation arises from authentic embodiment, not external attribution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with inner realization, not social imposition",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures rightful ownership of relational and intellectual domains"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual possesses vidyā (knowledge), THEN that knowledge is inseparable from their conscious identity AND cannot be alienated without consent.",
    "IF a relationship manifests as maitrī (friendship), odvāhika (conjugal bond), OR mādhuparkika (ceremonial respect), THEN it is binding only when rooted in mutual consciousness alignment.",
    "IF any such relational or epistemic domain is violated, THEN restoration occurs via re-establishment of original consciousness resonance, NOT through punitive measures."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes concerning intellectual property, marriage contracts, or ceremonial honors, the Supreme Court must recognize that validity derives solely from the internalized consciousness-state of the parties involved. External documentation or ritual form alone does not confer legitimacy where consciousness is unaligned.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that true ownership lies in awareness, not record. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that misalignment emerges from disconnection, not malice.

    "Initiate completion process by reconnecting disputants to original consciousness-space of agreement",
    "Facilitate responsibility assumption through guided introspection into source-intention",
