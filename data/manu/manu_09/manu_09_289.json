  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who breaches walls, fills moats, or breaks gates shall be immediately removed from the settlement.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in protection of collective structural integrity",
    "Causation arises from direct violation of secured boundaries",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by physical capability to breach",
    "Restoration logic requires removal to prevent recurrence",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of boundary sanctity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent breaches wall THEN initiate immediate relocation protocol",

    "Responsibility acknowledgment precedes reintegration eligibility"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations of civic fortification laws, the Supreme Court must prioritize the restoration of societal security infrastructure over punitive measures. The threshold for action is the demonstrable capacity to cause structural breach, regardless of intent. Authority lies in maintaining dharma-vyavastha (right order), not in assigning blame.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal linkage between unauthorized intrusion and systemic vulnerability. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that unchecked boundary violations lead to collapse of communal safety. Proportional response entails spatial separation until alignment with protective dharma is restored. No suffering is induced; only realignment of presence within sacred geography occurs.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through conscious alignment, not punishment. Reality reflects non-retaliation; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
