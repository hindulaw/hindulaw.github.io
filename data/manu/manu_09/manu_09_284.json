  "sanskrit_verse": "चिकित्सकानां सर्वेषां मिथ्याप्रचरतां दमः ।\nअमानुषेषु प्रथमो मानुषेषु तु मध्यमः ॥ ९.२८४॥",
  "transliteration": "cikitsakānāṁ sarveṣāṁmithyāpracaratāṁ damaḥ |\namānuṣeṣu prathamo mānuṣeṣu tu madhyamaḥ || 9.284||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The consequence for all physicians who act falsely is immediate energetic correction; in non-human realms it manifests first, in human realms it manifests moderately.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises through conscious deviation from truth-functional capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility applies universally across sentient forms",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential karmic alignment rather than punitive judgment",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the intensity and form of corrective resonance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF practitioner deviates from truthful healing intent THEN initiate automatic energetic recalibration protocol",
    "IF deviation occurs in non-human domain THEN apply primary-level corrective resonance",
    "IF deviation occurs in human domain THEN apply secondary-level integrative restoration cycle",
    "IF repeated misalignment detected THEN escalate completion process until integrity restored",
    "IF consciousness coherence re-established THEN deactivate all active correction sequences"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that medical practitioners bear direct causal liability when violating truth-based healing duties. The court must recognize varying levels of manifestation based on species-specific consciousness fields while applying restorative measures that realign professional integrity without punitive overlays.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that false practice generates immediate energetic dissonance requiring correction. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures consequences manifest according to ontological context—earlier in subtler realms, later in grosser ones. Responsibility remains proportional to awareness capacity. Retribution has no place where Dharma itself orchestrates recalibration through natural law mechanisms.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Prāṇa-Shuddhi Protocol to cleanse false intention patterns",
    "Deploy Satya-Sankalpa Alignment Matrix to restore truthful purpose",
    "Activate Karmic Resonance Harmonizer to reintegrate service orientation",
    "Engage Vak-Siddhi Completion Process to align speech and action with curative intent",
    "Conduct Antarātman Reconciliation Ritual to reaffirm sacred duty vows"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma flows unimpeded by illusion. Truth restores itself through inherent cosmic mechanisms. No punishment exists where consciousness awakens. Reality adjudicates through alignment alone."
