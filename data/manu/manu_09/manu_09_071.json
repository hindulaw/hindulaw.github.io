  "sanskrit_verse": "न दत्त्वा कस्य चित्कन्यां पुनर्दद्याद्विचक्षणः ।\nदत्त्वा पुनः प्रयच्छन् हि प्राप्नोति पुरुषानृतम् ॥ ९.७१॥",
  "transliteration": "na dattvā kasya cit kanyāṁ punar dadyād vicakṣaṇaḥ | dattvā punaḥ prayacchan hi prāpnoti puruṣānṛtam || 9.71 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A wise man does not give a daughter in marriage again after having given her once; whoever gives her again after giving her before attains falsehood in men.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The giver of the bride holds irreversible guardianship responsibility until completion of lawful union.",
    "Causation: Reassignment of guardianship without dissolution causes ontological misalignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those with intact integrity can execute marital bestowal.",
    "Restoration logic: Misplaced trust and broken relational boundaries require realignment through conscious completion.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Truthful transactional conduct upholds societal harmony."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman has been lawfully bestowed in marriage by a competent guardian THEN no subsequent bestowal by any party is valid.",
    "IF a prior marriage contract exists AND it remains un-dissolved THEN any further act of marital assignment invokes anṛta-liability.",
    "IF a guardian reassigns a previously assigned daughter THEN automatic restoration protocol initiates for relational-integrity realignment.",
    "IF marital bestowal occurs post-existing union THEN system flags ontological inconsistency for corrective action."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving repeated marital assignments, the Supreme Court shall recognize that only the first lawful assignment holds juridical validity unless prior union is formally dissolved. Subsequent acts invoke anṛta-liability and necessitate restoration protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "By pramāṇa, the causal sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ) establishes that re-bestowal disrupts dharmic relational order. Responsibility lies in aligning consciousness to complete prior commitments before initiating new ones. Punishment serves no purpose where completion restores truth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Require responsible party to dissolve prior commitment fully before engaging in future unions.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Protocol: Facilitate reconciliation between affected parties to restore relational balance.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Mechanism: Assign accountability to correct false transactions without inflicting harm.",
    "Capacity Restoration Procedure: Provide guidance to ensure future decisions uphold dharmic precision."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: This verse enforces irrevocable guardianship upon lawful marital assignment. Repeated assignment incurs anṛta-liability. Justice is executed through consciousness-aligned restoration. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
