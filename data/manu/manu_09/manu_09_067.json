  "transliteration": "sa mahīm akhilāṁ bhuñjan rājarṣipravaraḥ purā |\nvarṇānāṁ saṅkaraṁ cakre kāmopahetacetasḥ || 9.67 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He, the foremost among royal sages, having enjoyed the entire earth, formerly caused intermixture among the varnas due to consciousness overwhelmed by desire.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority devolves upon those whose consciousness remains unshaken by desire.",
    "Causation originates in the distortion of dharma through loss of self-governance.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from one's ability to maintain alignment with cosmic order.",
    "Restoration logic demands rectification of systemic disorder initiated by leadership.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social position when determining lawful action."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler's cognition is impaired by sensual impulse THEN administrative decisions are null and void UNTIL conscious integrity is restored.",
    "IF societal hierarchy becomes disrupted due to leader's misconduct THEN corrective governance MUST originate from a sovereign source beyond affected domain.",
    "WHEN authority breaches foundational dharma THEN automatic recall and replacement protocols activate without punitive intervention.",
    "RESTORATIVE GOVERNANCE shall prioritize reestablishment of natural order over attribution of blame or imposition of consequence."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling issued under compromised mental or spiritual state of the presiding judge or governing body shall be deemed invalid ex post facto, necessitating immediate transfer of jurisdiction to a tribunal constituted by SPH-sanctioned dharmic intelligence until systemic coherence is reinstated.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that disruption flows sequentially from misaligned consciousness; thus, correction follows causal sequence rather than proportional punishment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures restoration proceeds stepwise from root disturbance to manifest effect. Responsibility aligns with capacity for self-regulation, not positional power. The non-punitive reality rule confirms no entity suffers for another’s deviation—only realignment occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sovereign audit of all executive acts performed during period of desire-induced impairment.",
    "Reassign governmental functions to an interim council constituted directly under SPH authority.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma flows from undistorted consciousness alone. All actions rooted in desire-led delusion are inherently dissolved. Justice serves only restoration. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness itself adjudicates truth."
