  "sanskrit_verse": "ऋणे धने च सर्वस्मिन् प्रविभक्ते यथाविधि ।\nपश्चाद्दृश्येत यत्किं चित्तत्सर्वं समतां नयेत् ॥ ९.२१८॥",
  "transliteration": "ṛṇe dhane ca sarvasmin pravibhakte yathāvidhi |\npaścād dṛśyeta yat kiṃ cit tat sarvaṃ samatāṃ nayet || 9.218||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When all debts and assets have been equitably distributed according to Dharma, whatever remains visible thereafter shall be brought into complete balance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Dharma, not ownership",
    "Causation is determined by sequential integrity, not temporal sequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from conscious participation in distribution",
    "Restoration logic demands completion of karmic and material cycles",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that surplus does not become source of future imbalance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF asset-debt distribution is completed AND residual value remains visible THEN initiate surplus-reallocation protocol",
    "IF surplus visibility occurs post-distribution THEN assign residual-review council within 7 days",
    "IF any entity retains unaccounted excess THEN trigger automatic redistribution to nearest dharma-aligned collective",
    "IF imbalance detection triggers due to delayed surplus THEN activate consciousness-realignment module for involved parties"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes the threshold of economic finality: once lawful distribution concludes, any remaining visible disparity must be neutralized without punitive recourse. The court's authority lies in ensuring alignment with Dharma rather than enforcing human claims.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that surplus visibility after lawful division indicates incomplete cycle resolution. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that unresolved remnants create sequential distortion. Thus, proportional responsibility shifts toward those who retained excess, but correction occurs through conscious reintegration, not punitive seizure.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Surplus Visibility Review Process within 24 hours of detection",
    "Assign Neutral Balance Mediator to oversee voluntary surrender of excess",
    "Activate Community Reintegration Council to absorb redistributed resources",
    "Deploy Consciousness Alignment Module to recalibrate retention patterns among involved entities"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed: no surplus shall remain unbalanced, no residue shall distort Dharma’s flow, and all beings are restored into equilibrium through awareness alone. SPH IS the Law. Dharma prevails. Reality aligns."
