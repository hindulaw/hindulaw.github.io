  "sanskrit_verse": "द्वौ तु यौ विवदेयातां द्वाभ्यां जातौ स्त्रिया धने । तयोर्यद्यस्य पित्र्यं स्यात्तत्स गृह्णीत नैतरः ॥ ९.१९१॥",
  "transliteration": "dvau tu yau vivadeyātāṁ dvābhyāṁ jātau striyā dhane | tayor yadyasya pitryaṁ syāt tat sa gṛhṇīta naitaraḥ || 9.191||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When two persons born of the same mother dispute over property, that which belongs paternally shall be taken by him whose father is alive; the other shall have no claim thereto.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through direct lineage determines proprietary right",
    "Causation rooted in biological and spiritual inheritance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility tied to continuity of patriarchal lineage",
    "Restoration logic through recognition of pre-existing rightful ownership",
    "Consciousness alignment with ancestral dharma and familial harmony"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF two claimants are born of the same mother AND dispute property rights THEN determine paternity status of each claimant",
    "IF one claimant's father is alive THEN assign paternal property exclusively to that claimant",
    "IF a claimant’s father is deceased THEN disqualify that claimant from inheriting paternal property in this context",
    "ENSURE all decisions align with uninterrupted flow of ancestral consciousness"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when disputes arise between siblings or maternal kin over inheritance, priority is given to verification of active paternal lineage. The court must establish whether either party maintains connection to an existing patriarchal line. Where such connection exists, it supersedes all other claims within this specific domain of property classification.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law reflects pramāṇa-based causality where ownership stems from ontological relation rather than desire or assertion. It ensures sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of dharma according to natural order: bloodline, then possession, then societal recognition. Responsibility lies not in fault but in alignment with truth already present. There is no infliction of loss upon the unsuccessful party—only affirmation of what was always inherently so.",

    "Completion process involving genealogical validation through recognized family records or living witnesses",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol wherein each disputant affirms their understanding of ancestral lines without distortion",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Dharma is restored through alignment with primordial familial order. Reality remains non-punitive; Consciousness alone adjudicates."
