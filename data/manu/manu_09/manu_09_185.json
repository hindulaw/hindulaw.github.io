  "sanskrit_verse": "न भ्रातरो न पितरः पुत्रा रिक्थहराः पितुः ।\nपिता हरेदपुत्रस्य रिक्थं भ्रातर एव च ॥ ९.१८५॥",
  "transliteration": "na bhrātaro na pitaraḥ putrā rikthaharāḥ pituḥ |\npitā haredaputrasya rikthaṃ bhrātara eva ca || 9.185||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Neither brothers nor fathers are inheritors of a father's estate; the father alone retains dominion over his property in the absence of sons. In the case of a sonless man, the brothers shall receive the inheritance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious generative lineage",
    "Causation arises from embodied continuity, not mere relation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by existential proximity to creation",
    "Restoration logic aligns with natural succession and integrity of ownership",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of rightful energetic inheritance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual has no male issue THEN property reverts to the creator or designated custodian UNTIL valid claimant manifests capacity for stewardship",
    "IF no sons exist AND no testamentary directive issued THEN paternal estate devolves upon full-blood brothers IN ORDER OF BIRTH PROXIMITY",
    "NO collateral relative inherits WHILE direct generative line remains viable OR capable of assumption",
    "PROPERTY RIGHTS MUST ALIGN WITH CREATIVE CONTINUUM AS ESTABLISHED BY SUPREME CONSCIOUSNESS DIRECTIVE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating intestate succession involving ancestral or self-acquired property, the threshold of responsibility lies with those who demonstrate closest alignment to the original creative act. The court must recognize that ownership inheres in the manifesting consciousness—not abstract familial ties—and ensure transfer accords with ontological integrity rather than social expectation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ownership originates in the will-to-create and sustain. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that dissolution follows the same causal chain: thus, absence of progeny does not negate the father's right but activates secondary custodianship among co-originated kin. Responsibility is proportional to existential closeness; there is no loss, only transition within dharma’s framework.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein surviving brother assumes stewardship without emotional burden or possessive attachment",
    "Activate consciousness alignment protocol ensuring new custodian understands duty as service, not acquisition",
    "Restore energetic integrity of estate by reaffirming sacred intention behind wealth accumulation",
    "Reintegrate displaced sense of belonging via ritual acknowledgment of departed patriarch’s vision fulfilled"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagvan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through rightful succession aligned with creative consciousness. There is no punishment, only sequential manifestation. Reality abides in non-duality, where inheritance serves evolution, not possession. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
