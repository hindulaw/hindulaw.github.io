  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Upon the first offense of severing a finger joint, the hand or foot shall be severed; upon the third offense, death is warranted.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in sequential manifestation of transgression",
    "Causation aligns with escalating violation of integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with repeated breach",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional response to prevent recurrence",
    "Consciousness alignment requires removal of instruments of harm"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offender commits first instance of joint-severance THEN remove offending limb",
    "IF offender commits second instance of limb-based violence THEN remove additional limbs",
    "IF offender commits third instance of irreversible harm THEN warrant termination of embodied capacity",
    "All actions must preserve societal dharma through proportional incapacitation",
    "No punitive intent allowed—only structural alignment with cosmic order"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility lies in documented repetition and escalation. Authority derives from Dharma-preserving necessity, not retributive justice. Restoration precedes incapacitation; final action taken only when recurrence proves systemic misalignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that repeated acts indicate deeper consciousness disorder. Anupūrvaśaḥ establishes progressive incapacity as corrective measure, not vengeance. Proportional responsibility ensures no excess use of force. Non-punitive reality rule maintains focus on realignment, not infliction.",

    "Completion process for first offense involves ritual purification and community service before amputation",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol for second offense includes public acknowledgment and surrender of mobility tools",

    "Integrity reintegration facilitated through ancestral lineage healing post-resolution"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed for restoration alone. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as ultimate adjudicator."
