  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The firstborn male child, by virtue of his birthright, becomes the designated heir and upholder of ancestral duty; being unindebted to ancestors, he is entitled to all inheritance and spiritual authority.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from ontological precedence and spiritual alignment",
    "Causation flows from divine order, not social construct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inherent dharma, not external attribution",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters of succession and inheritance, the Supreme Court shall recognize primogeniture as a constitutional principle rooted in Sanatana Dharma, where the eldest son's right is not based on patriarchy but on spiritual readiness and ancestral continuity. The court must ensure no punitive interpretation disrupts this natural order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that birth order reflects karmic readiness and cosmic alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation of dharma through the firstborn. Responsibility arises naturally from capacity, not imposition. There is no punishment for others; their paths are equally valid within their own svadharma.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: primogeniture is an expression of divine order, not human preference. Dharma is restored through recognition of inherent capacity, not punitive enforcement. Reality remains non-punitive, consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
