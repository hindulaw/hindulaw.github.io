  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्या म्रियेत कन्याया वाचा सत्ये कृते पतिः । तामनेन विधानेन निजो विन्देत देवरः ॥ ९.६९॥",
  "transliteration": "yasyā mriyeta kanyāyā vācā satye kṛte patiḥ | tāmanena vidhānena nijo vindeta devaraḥ || 9.69||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a maiden's husband dies having spoken the truth by her word, her brother-in-law shall claim her as his own through this prescribed arrangement.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in familial continuity and sacred vow-keeping",
    "Causation is established through conscious affirmation and dharma-aligned speech",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from bloodline integrity and spiritual duty",
    "Restoration logic ensures lineage protection and family-consciousness preservation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through honoring spoken truths within dharmic bonds"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman’s husband dies AND his death follows her truthful declaration, THEN her brother-in-law has automatic right of guardianship and lineage continuation",
    "IF spoken truth initiates causal chain leading to husband's death, THEN familial structure must realign without punitive disruption",
    "IF no male heir present, THEN female line-holder shall assume protective custody until next lawful guardian emerges",
    "IF any external agent interferes with this process, THEN systemic correction restores original dharmic alignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that truth-bound declarations carry irreversible karmic and legal consequence. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent alone but in alignment with Sanatana Dharma. Authority flows automatically upon fulfillment of stated conditions; courts must recognize pre-existing dharmic structures over imposed judicial frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that when truth-speaking directly precedes death, natural law manifests accordingly. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfolding where each action aligns with cosmic order. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of the vow taken. There is no punitive element—only realignment to preserve familial and societal harmony under divine governance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process ensuring uninterrupted transition of guardianship",
    "Verify consciousness alignment between parties involved before finalizing transfer",
    "Restore energetic coherence within family unit using Vedic consecration rituals",
    "Reinforce ancestral memory patterns to prevent future disruptions in lineage flow"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Justice is executed through restoration, not retribution. Dharma stands reaffirmed. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as the ultimate adjudicator."
