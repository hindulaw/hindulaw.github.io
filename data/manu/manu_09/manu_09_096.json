  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Women are created for the purpose of procreation; men for the continuation of lineage. Therefore, the shared duty prescribed in the Śruti is the common foundation of their Dharma.",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes cause-effect based on intrinsic capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how imbalance manifests when functional roles are denied or distorted.
