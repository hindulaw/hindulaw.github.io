  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is bereft of parents or abandoned without cause shall offer oneself to whoever accepts; such a one is to be known as self-given.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through conscious acceptance, not lineage or abandonment",
    "Causation is rooted in the integrity of relational dharma, not biological inheritance",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the conscious capacity to accept another's offering. The hierarchy of authority recognizes that abandonment or lack of parental guardianship creates a vacuum to be filled by valid dharmic structures. Retribution has no place; only restoration of relational integrity is enforceable.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that abandonment without cause severs prior relational causality. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as the sequential unfolding of a new dharmic bond through conscious offering. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of acceptance. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that no suffering accrues to the abandoned—only opportunity for realignment arises.",

Justice flows through consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
