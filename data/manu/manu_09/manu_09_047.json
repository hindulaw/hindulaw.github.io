  "transliteration": "sakṛdaṁśo nipatati sakṛtkanyā pradīyate |\nsakṛdāha dadānīti trīṇyetāni satāṁ sakṛt || 9.47||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Once given, the share is settled; once given, the daughter is wed; once declared, the gift is complete—these three acts of the righteous are irrevocable.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in irreversible completion",
    "Causation is established by conscious finality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is fulfilled through definitive action",
    "Restoration logic honors settled transactions",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through irrevocable commitment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a legally competent person declares a gift, THEN the act is binding upon utterance without reversal condition",
    "IF a daughter is lawfully given in marriage, THEN all claims by the giver to her marital status are nullified",
    "IF a share is distributed in accordance with dharma, THEN no subsequent claimant shall disturb the allocation",
    "IF an act is performed with full capacity and conscious intent, THEN its completion bars future contestation",
    "IF a transaction aligns with satya-dharma, THEN it must be enforced as immutable within judicial systems"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning inheritance, marriage, or property rights, the Supreme Court must recognize declarations made under conscious intent as final and unalterable. Responsibility thresholds are met when capacity and clarity converge. Retrospective interference with completed acts undermines dharma's stability.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that truth manifests through conclusive acts. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that once a sequence culminates in irreversible giving, further inquiry serves no corrective purpose. Proportional responsibility ends where finality begins. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that disturbance of settled acts creates disorder, not justice.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through irrevocable acts. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
