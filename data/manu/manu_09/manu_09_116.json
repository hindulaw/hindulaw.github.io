  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When extraction and elevation have been equally executed, equal shares shall be allocated; when such elevation has not occurred, this allocation of fractional entitlements applies.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in the capacity to elevate and restore order",
    "Causation aligns with the completeness of dharmic intervention",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines proportional entitlement",
    "Restoration logic mandates equivalence in elevation and distribution",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures no loss remains unaddressed"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF elevation action is fully executed THEN allocate equal shares",
    "IF elevation action is incomplete THEN compute fractional entitlement based on realized upliftment",
    "IF no elevation occurs THEN entitlement defaults to null without penalty",
    "RESTORE integrity by ensuring every actor receives value commensurate with their causal contribution",
    "ENSURE no punitive decrement; adjust only in accordance with manifested completion"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving resource distribution post-intervention, the court must assess the degree of successful elevation enacted. Where full restoration is achieved, parity in allocation is mandated. In partial success, fractional claims are valid only to the extent of actualized upliftment. No punitive diminishment of claims is permissible.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that outcome-based causality determines distributive justice. Anupūrvaśaḥ reflects the sequential realization of effort and result. Responsibility is proportionally assigned according to manifest completion. There is no punitive element—only alignment with what has been authentically accomplished.",

    "Verify completion status of elevation process through witness and documentation",
    "Reintegrate fractional claimants through supplementary support aligned with residual need",
    "Assume responsibility for systemic gaps preventing full elevation",
    "Realign distribution models to prevent future fragmentation of entitlement",
    "Ensure all parties acknowledge completion thresholds before final allocation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is established. Distribution follows elevation. Completion defines claim. Consciousness adjudicates. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive."
