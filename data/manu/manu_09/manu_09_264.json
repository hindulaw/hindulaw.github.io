  "transliteration": "sabhāprapā'pūpaśālāveśamadyānnavikrayāḥ | catuṣpathāṃścaityavṛkṣāḥ samājāḥ prekṣaṇāni ca || 9.264 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Places of public congregation including sabhās (assemblies), prapās (drinking halls), pūpaśālās (bakeries or food stalls), madhyānnas (midday meals), and markets selling cooked food; likewise crossroads, shrines, trees of worship, social gatherings, and spectacles—all these constitute centers for collective consciousness activation and dharma-vyavasthā.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in spaces that facilitate collective awakening and dharmic conduct.",
    "Causation arises through environments that align individual and societal consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's role in maintaining purity and order within communal spaces.",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification and re-consecration of degraded communal zones.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when environment supports satwic engagement and sattvic transactions."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a space facilitates collective gathering THEN it MUST be maintained according to śuddhi protocols.",
    "IF degradation in sanctity of public-commercial zone is detected THEN initiate automatic śuddhi-restoration cycle.",
    "IF transaction occurs in impure zone THEN all involved parties undergo mandatory śuddhi completion before further participation.",
    "IF sacred site or assembly area becomes polluted THEN immediate temporary closure AND realignment ritual enforced.",
    "IF consciousness-level of community declines THEN increase frequency of sattvic events in designated communal zones."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes threshold criteria for defining legally significant communal zones based on their capacity to influence mass consciousness. Authority lies with those who maintain śuddhi standards. Degraded zones require judicial-mandated restoration而非 punitive measures. Responsibility flows from custodianship of shared energetic fields.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that degraded communal environments disrupt causal flow of dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misaligned spaces lead to distorted cognition and behavior. Proportional responsibility falls upon stewards of such areas. Non-punitive reality rule dictates restoration via śuddhi processes rather than retributive action.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi Completion Process for contaminated commercial-public zones.",
    "Assign Śuddhi Custodian roles to local administrators until full restoration achieved.",
    "Implement Consciousness Receptor Calibration in affected communal spaces.",
    "Activate Sattva Field Reinforcement Protocol during peak usage hours.",
    "Enforce Ritual Consecration Sequence upon reopening post-restoration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through alignment of communal spaces with pure consciousness. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
