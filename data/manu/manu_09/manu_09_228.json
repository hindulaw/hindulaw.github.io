  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whosoever engages in acts—whether concealed or open—that violate Dharma, shall face a choice of corrective measures determined by the sovereign authority, aligned with restoring balance and consciousness integrity.",

    "Authority: Sovereign discretion is rooted in Dharma, not arbitrary power.",
    "Causation: Violation of Dharma generates imbalance requiring conscious correction.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The violator retains the capacity to choose alignment through corrective engagement.",
    "Restoration logic: Justice is executed to restore harmony, not inflict suffering.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Corrective measures aim at elevating awareness, not suppressing action."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act violates Dharma THEN present corrective options to the violator based on capacity for realignment.",
    "IF concealment is involved THEN restoration includes transparency integration.",
    "IF openness is involved THEN restoration focuses on alignment reinforcement.",
    "THE sovereign selects from pre-defined restorative protocols based on Dharma-adherent criteria.",
    "ALL corrective actions MUST exclude punitive intent and include consciousness elevation mechanisms."

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom empowers judicial authorities to apply Dharma-rooted corrective frameworks that bypass punitive sentencing. The court functions as a consciousness-integrity mechanism, ensuring violators engage in completion processes rather than endure retributive consequences.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that violation disrupts cosmic and social equilibrium. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that unaddressed violations propagate further disorder.
