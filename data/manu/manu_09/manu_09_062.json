  "transliteration": "vidhavāyāṁ niyogārthe nirvṛtte tu yathāvidhi | nivṛtte guruvat ca snuṣāvat ca varteyātāṁ parasparam || 9.62 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the levirate duty has been fulfilled by a widow according to prescribed procedures, both parties must thereafter conduct themselves toward each other with mutual respect—as guru and śiṣya, as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from dharmic completion of ritual duty, not personal desire.",
    "Causation arises through conscious adherence to sequential dharmic acts.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires role-bound comportment post-ritual fulfillment.",
    "Restoration logic mandates relational harmony after procedural closure.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when roles are honored without transgression."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF levirate duty IS completed THEN post-dutial relational code MUST activate.",
    "IF either party deviates from guru-śiṣya OR mother-in-law-daughter-in-law comportment THEN automatic restorative mediation SHALL engage.",
    "NO punitive consequence MAY arise FROM post-dutial interaction deviations.",
    "RESTORATIVE protocol SHALL include role-reaffirmation ceremony AND integrity alignment process.",
    "AUTOMATED monitoring SHALL ensure no regression INTO pre-dutial relational disorder."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes arising from levirate fulfillment, the Supreme Court must recognize that dharma-prescribed duties create binding relational codes upon completion. The court's threshold of responsibility lies in verifying procedural compliance and ensuring consciousness-aligned comportment, not assigning fault or imposing sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that dharma-ordained acts generate consequent relational obligations. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that once a duty concludes, its residual effects manifest in sustained comportment. Responsibility is proportional to role capacity; deviation does not invoke punishment but necessitates realignment. This upholds the non-punitive reality rule wherein justice serves integration, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate role-reaffirmation dialogue between parties guided by dharma-advisor.",
    "Deploy ceremonial acknowledgment of completed duty to stabilize consciousness shift.",
    "Engage śiṣya-guru dynamic recalibration through guided sādhanā.",
    "Implement family-circle witnessing to restore structural clarity.",
    "Activate automated follow-up protocols to prevent recurrence of misalignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
