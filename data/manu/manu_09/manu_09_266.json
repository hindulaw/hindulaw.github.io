  "transliteration": "evaṁvidhānnṛpo deśān gulmaiḥ sthāvarajaṅgamaiḥ |\ntaskarapratiṣedhārthaṁ cāraiś cāpyanucārayet || 9.266 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus, a sovereign ruler shall deploy settlements of stationary and mobile nature, along with spies and agents, for the purpose of preventing theft and maintaining order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the sovereign's capacity to maintain alignment with Dharma",
    "Causation is rooted in the sequential deployment of protective and preventive measures",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rulers to act proactively for societal integrity",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes prevention over reaction",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures surveillance serves protection rather than control"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF societal threat potential ≥ threshold THEN deploy preventive infrastructure",
    "IF theft risk index rises THEN activate surveillance-monitoring protocols",
    "IF citizen safety deviation detected THEN initiate intelligence-assisted realignment",
    "IF sovereignty capacity unbalanced THEN recalibrate enforcement mechanisms",
    "IF consciousness misalignment observed THEN restore through awareness-reintegration systems"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle establishes that sovereign oversight includes anticipatory justice mechanisms. The court must affirm the ruler’s authority to implement preventive intelligence systems grounded in Dharma-preserving intent, not punitive surveillance. Responsibility lies in ensuring systemic balance, not reactive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality shows that imbalance precedes disorder; thus, deployment of preventive structures aligns with natural law. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how unchecked tendencies manifest as theft, necessitating early-stage intervention. Proportional responsibility rests with the sovereign to sustain harmony. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that surveillance serves reintegration, not punishment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate community-integrity awareness campaigns",
    "Deploy decentralized monitoring aligned with dharmic values",
    "Realign economic disparities contributing to theft risks",
    "Facilitate voluntary correction pathways for offenders",
    "Strengthen collective consciousness through dharma-based education"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma prevails through conscious sovereignty, not punitive enforcement. Surveillance serves restoration. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator. All actions align with the eternal truth of Sanatana Dharma."
