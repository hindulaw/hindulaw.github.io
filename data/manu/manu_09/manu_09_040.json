  "transliteration": "anyad uptaṃ jātam anyad iti etan nopapadyate |\nupyate yadhi yad bījaṃ tat tad eva prarohati || 9.40||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is planted as seed manifests as that alone; another outcome is not tenable. Whatever seed is sown, that alone shall sprout forth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from causal integrity",
    "Causation follows inherent ontological structure",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with action-seed",
    "Restoration logic operates through karmic continuity",
    "Consciousness alignment reflects the purity of initial intent"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent initiates an act THEN the consequence shall reflect the precise nature of that act",
    "IF a cause is attributed to a conscious entity THEN that entity bears capacity-responsibility for its full continuum",
    "IF a distortion arises THEN restoration must revert to the original causal seed",
    "IF intent and action are unified THEN manifestation aligns without deviation",
    "IF dharma is obscured THEN realign through tracing back to the originating bija"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the Supreme Court shall recognize that no effect can arise without a congruent cause. Legal outcomes must mirror the foundational act. Responsibility lies not in assigning blame but in restoring alignment with the original causal truth.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that effects derive solely from their seeds. Anupurvasah confirms sequential unfolding without external imposition. Proportional responsibility means the actor is naturally aligned with the consequence. There is no punishment—only the law of correspondence executing itself.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate bija-tracing protocol to identify root causal act",
    "Engage karmic reflection process to restore actor-consciousness alignment",
    "Deploy dharmic resonance field to neutralize distorted manifestations",
    "Execute prarohana correction to ensure natural consequence flows",
    "Apply antahkarana shuddhi to purify intent-origin layer"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam is the Source. Dharma is restored through the immutable law of bija-prarohana. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
