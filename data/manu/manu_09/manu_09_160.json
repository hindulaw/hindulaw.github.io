  "transliteration": "kānīnaśca sahodhaśca krītaḥ paurbhavastathā |\nsvayaṃdattaśca śaudraśca ṣaḍadāyādabāndhavāḥ || 9.160 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Six heirs who are not blood relatives but inherit by law: the adopted son, the son of the wife cohabiting with another man, the purchased son, the posthumous son, the self-given son, and the Śaudra son.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious designation, not biological lineage alone",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism of societal continuity, not merely familial privilege",
    "Capacity for stewardship determines eligibility for inheritance",
    "Dharma recognizes functional kinship beyond genetic ties",
    "Restoration of family integrity supersedes punitive exclusion of non-traditional heirs"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF heir is designated through conscious intent AND fulfills role of succession THEN legal recognition is granted",
    "IF biological relation is absent BUT social integration and function are present THEN inheritance rights apply",
    "IF heir assumes responsibility without coercion THEN legitimacy is established",
    "IF societal stability requires inclusion of non-bloodline heirs THEN legal framework adapts accordingly",
    "IF heir participates in completion of ancestral duties THEN inheritance validity is affirmed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority must recognize that inheritance laws derive from dharma-consciousness, not genealogical purity. Legal standing of non-bloodline heirs is upheld when their integration serves continuation of dharmic order and familial duty fulfillment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that causality lies in intentional adoption and societal acceptance, not birth alone. Sequential manifestation of heir status arises through conscious act and sustained role assumption. Responsibility aligns with capacity to maintain lineage integrity. No punitive exclusion applies; all recognized heirs participate in restorative balance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure full assumption of duties by designated heir regardless of origin",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Formal acknowledgment and integration into familial and societal roles",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Support structures enabling effective stewardship",
    "Integrity Reintegration Framework: Normalize status within community through ceremonial affirmation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of lawful heirs beyond bloodline. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
