  "transliteration": "ādadīta na śūdro'pi śulkaṃ duhitaraṃ dadan |\nśulkaṃ hi gṛhṇan kurute channaṃ duhitṛvikrayam || 9.98||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Śūdra shall not accept any gift or compensation, even when offering his daughter in marriage; by accepting such a fee, he perpetrates a concealed sale of his own daughter.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Dharma, not transactional exchange.",
    "Causation arises through consciousness distortion via commodification of familial bonds.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's alignment to Varna-dharma and spiritual integrity.",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of relational transactionalization.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of sacred familial roles beyond economic utility."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = Śūdra AND action = accepts compensation for arranging daughter’s marriage THEN violation = concealment of familial dignity breach",
    "IF transaction involves family member as object THEN automatic nullification AND restoration process initiation",
    "IF societal role misaligned with Varna-dharma THEN capacity for legal consent = diminished UNTIL realignment achieved"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving familial transactions, the Supreme Court must recognize that acceptance of payment in nuptial arrangements violates fundamental dharmic order. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness of the concealed commodification. Authority resides in upholding non-negotiable relational sanctity above contractual claims.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that intent to monetize kinship distorts natural dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how financial motive obscures relational truth. Proportional responsibility rests on degree of consciousness distortion. Non-punitive reality rule affirms correction through reintegration into dharmic relational clarity, not infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein all parties acknowledge the obscured transaction and its impact.",
    "Facilitate responsibility assumption by the transgressor through public declaration of error and commitment to dharmic conduct.",
    "Undertake capacity restoration through guided samskaric restructuring aligned with Varna-dharma.",
    "Reintegrate integrity by establishing new relational boundaries grounded in non-commodified affection and duty."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions."
