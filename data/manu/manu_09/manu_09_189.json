  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The wealth of the Brahmin is ever inviolable and must remain untouched by the King; when all other varnas are absent, the King may take from them only to restore dharma, never for personal gain.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with dharma, not dominion over property",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness distortion, not material possession",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires rulers to protect, not exploit, sacred wealth",
    "Restoration logic demands that resources flow toward dharma-reestablishment",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates safeguarding those who sustain spiritual order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler's action disrupts Brahmin’s spiritual function THEN action is null",
    "IF resource seizure occurs without dharma-restoration intent THEN seizure is void",
    "IF all non-Brahmin support structures collapse THEN temporary reallocation allowed under supervision",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that violation of spiritual-economic boundaries distorts causal harmony; anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how such actions propagate suffering; proportional responsibility rests solely on misaligned authority; punitive response invalidates true justice which restores balance through conscious rectification.",

    "Initiate sovereign review of violated holdings to ensure restitution without attribution of fault",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring mechanisms to verify intent alignment before asset release",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: no temporal power may infringe upon the sacred stewardship of the Brahmin. All enforcement serves consciousness elevation alone. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
