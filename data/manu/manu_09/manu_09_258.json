  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who provoke unrest, those who create false dependencies, deceivers, gamblers—all who operate under auspicious pretenses for selfish ends, along with those who align with spies, are to be removed from positions of influence and realigned with their true capacity for dharmic action.",
