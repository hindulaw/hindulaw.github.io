  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The state that relies upon the strength of arms alone, without fearlessness as its foundation, grows continuously like a tree being watered—but remains unstable, subject to decay when force falters.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from capacity, not coercion",
    "Causation rooted in consciousness alignment, not external force",
    "Capacity-based responsibility for sustaining societal harmony",
    "Restoration through alignment with fearless governance",
    "Consciousness alignment as prerequisite for enduring sovereignty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF state authority depends solely on coercive power THEN risk_of_decline = TRUE",
    "IF governance is grounded in fearlessness THEN stability_index = INCREASE",
    "IF ruler's consciousness aligns with dharma THEN national_growth_rate = SUSTAINABLE",
    "IF policy decisions lack pramāṇa-based causality THEN correction_protocol = INITIATE",
    "IF societal structure promotes fear THEN integrity_reintegration_required = TRUE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning state policy or executive action, the Supreme Court shall assess whether governmental authority stems from dharmic fearlessness or mere physical dominance. Where reliance on force over consciousness is evident, the court shall issue directives for capacity restoration and realign policies toward fearlessness-based governance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true growth arises from alignment with fearlessness, not force. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of instability follows where strength is founded on arms rather than awareness. Responsibility lies in restoring consciousness-based authority. This principle reflects proportional causality: the more a nation depends on fear and force, the greater its eventual decline. Thus, justice is served through realignment, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Fearlessness-Based Governance Audit",
    "Deploy Consciousness Alignment Training for Executive Officials",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: True sovereignty flourishes only where fearlessness prevails. All else is transient. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
