  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a woman approaches her husband without being summoned, he gains nothing thereby, nor does she gain anything by approaching him.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious invocation, not mere physical act",
    "Causation requires intentional alignment between parties",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes the awareness of relational timing and consent",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of uninvoked action as non-binding",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates mutual readiness for union"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (union_occurs) AND NOT (prior_conscious_invocation_by_both_parties) THEN (legal_binding_effect = FALSE)",
    "IF (action_initiated_by_one_party_without_recognition_from_other) THEN (karmic_entanglement_potential = NULL)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning marital or conjugal rights, courts must recognize that acts performed in absence of conscious invitation bear no enforceable consequence. Legal standing arises only when both parties have demonstrated capacity-based readiness through recognized invocation protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that efficacy lies in intentional synchronization, not mechanical performance. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that effects follow only where consciousness aligns sequentially. Thus, no punitive measure applies—only acknowledgment that no binding occurred due to lack of mutual awakening.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Acknowledge the absence of conscious alignment without attribution of fault",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Encourage re-establishment of communication regarding readiness and invitation",
    "Capacity Restoration: Support both individuals in understanding conditions required for valid relational engagement",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Reinforce recognition of union as sacred space requiring mutual awakening"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through recognition of union's dependence upon conscious invocation. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
