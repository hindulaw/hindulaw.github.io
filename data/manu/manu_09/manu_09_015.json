  "sanskrit_verse": "पौंश्चल्याच्चलचित्ताच्च नैस्नेह्याच्च स्वभावतः । नैःस्नेह्याच्च रक्षिता यत्नतोऽपीह भर्तृष्वेता विकुर्वते ॥ ९.१५॥",
  "transliteration": "pauṁścalyāccalacittācca naisnehyācca svabhāvataḥ | naiḥsnehyācca rakṣitā yatnato'pīha bhartṛṣvetā vikurvate || 9.15 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Women who are naturally unchaste, fickle-minded, or lacking in affection shall act contrary even to their protectors—husbands—despite being carefully guarded.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not mere social role",
    "Causation originates in consciousness distortion, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inner integrity, not outer control",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment of relational harmony and self-governance",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes structural enforcement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman exhibits persistent violation of marital Dharma despite lawful protection, THEN initiate completion process for dissolution of union without punitive attribution",
    "IF behavioral pattern reflects internal misalignment而非 external coercion, THEN responsibility lies in consciousness restoration而非 punitive consequence",
    "IF guardianship fails due to inherent capacity deficit而非 neglect, THEN reintegration protocol must precede any judicial review",
    "IF relational integrity cannot be restored through Nyaya mechanisms, THEN automatic initiation of separation protocols without blame assignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that where fundamental breakdown in relational dharma occurs—specifically when a spouse acts against the very basis of conjugal trust—the court must recognize the failure as rooted in consciousness disorder rather than willful misconduct. The threshold of responsibility shifts from punitive accountability to restorative realignment, prioritizing completion of unsustainable bonds over criminalization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality stems from intrinsic spiritual imbalance而非 deliberate defiance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that such conduct manifests sequentially from disordered consciousness. Proportional responsibility aligns with capacity for self-correction而非 infliction of penalty. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering does not restore truth; only觉醒 consciousness does.",

    "Initiate Completion Process for Irreconcilable Union",
    "Assign Responsibility Assumption Protocol to both parties for self-reflection",
    "Deploy Consciousness Restoration Mechanisms for individual purification",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law emanates directly from Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored through alignment with consciousness, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
