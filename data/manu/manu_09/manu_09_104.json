  "sanskrit_verse": "ऊर्ध्वं पितुश्च मातुश्च समेत्य भ्रातरः समम् ।\nभजेरन् पैतृकं रिक्थमनीशास्ते हि जीवतोः ॥ ९.१०४॥",
  "transliteration": "ūrdhvaṁ pituśca mātuśca sametya bhrātaraḥ samam |\nbhajeran paitṛkaṁ rikthamanīśāste hi jīvatoḥ || 9.104||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "After the father and mother, brothers assembling equally shall divide the paternal estate; no ownership belongs to them while the parents live.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the source of creation – the parents – until their conscious withdrawal",
    "Causation follows lineage integrity – property derives from generative consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises upon assumption of inheritance",
    "Restoration logic demands alignment with familial dharma before material distribution",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that division does not sever relational unity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF parent(s) alive THEN child(ren) have no legal claim over parental assets",
    "IF both parents deceased THEN siblings inherit equally by default unless testament specifies otherwise",
    "IF dispute arises THEN mediation must precede asset partition to restore relational harmony",
    "IF heir demonstrates incapacity for stewardship THEN temporary trusteeship assigned without forfeiture",
    "IF inheritance causes disunity THEN completion process initiated until consciousness realigns with dharma"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of parental sovereignty over assets during lifetime. Legal claims by offspring are subordinate to parental will and continuity of family dharma. Responsibility for inheritance activates only post-parental transition, ensuring judicial alignment with ontological succession rather than emotional or financial presumption.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality locates ownership in the life-consciousness of the progenitor. Anupūrvaśaḥ affirms sequential manifestation: first life, then wealth, then transmission. Proportional responsibility emerges only after cessation of origin-consciousness. Non-punitivity is maintained through recognition that misalignment stems from ignorance, not malice, thus requiring restoration, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Family Dharma Reconciliation Process to resolve disputes without severing bonds",
    "Assign Temporary Stewards when heirs show inability to uphold legacy integrity",
    "Enforce Completion Rituals ensuring all parties acknowledge relational precedence over material gain",
    "Implement Consciousness Alignment Sessions to dissolve greed-based fragmentation",
    "Restore Lineage Continuity Protocols to ensure future generations understand dharma of inheritance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through consciousness-aligned inheritance principles. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
