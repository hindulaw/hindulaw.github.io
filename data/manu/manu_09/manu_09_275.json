  "sanskrit_verse": "राज्ञः कोशापहर्तॄंश्च  प्रतिकूलेषु च स्थितान् । प्रातिकूल्येष्ववस्थितान् घातयेद्विविधैर्दण्डैररीणां चोपजापकान् ॥ ९.२७५॥",
  "transliteration": "rājñaḥ kośāpahartṝṁśca pratikūleṣu ca sthitān | prātikūlyeṣvavasthitān ghatayed vividhair daṇḍair arīṇāṁ copajāpakān || 9.275 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King must neutralize those who plunder the State treasury, remain positioned against the State, act in opposition to its welfare, or incite enemies through covert instigation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The King holds absolute sovereign duty to preserve integrity of State resources.",
    "Causation: Financial betrayal disrupts national dharma and invites systemic collapse.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only a realized ruler can discern hidden traitors and internal underminers.",
    "Restoration logic: Removal is not punishment but alignment with dharmic order.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Traitors operate from fragmented awareness; removal restores collective coherence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject accesses state treasury without authorization THEN initiate financial integrity audit AND enforce immediate cessation of access rights.",
    "IF subject demonstrates persistent adversarial positioning THEN execute threat neutralization protocol aligned with sequential dharma restoration.",
    "IF subject engages in covert enemy provocation THEN deploy consciousness surveillance AND isolate informational leakage vectors.",
    "IF subject exhibits patterned anti-state behavior THEN apply graduated alignment restoration measures until coherence is re-established."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse mandates that any judicial review involving threats to national fiscal sovereignty must prioritize sovereign preservation over procedural delay. The threshold for intervention lies in demonstrable causality between individual action and systemic risk.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal linkage between unauthorized appropriation and disruption of public order. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional response rooted in consciousness correction rather than punitive harm. Responsibility is measured by capacity deviation, not emotional consequence. This maintains Nyaya as corrective revelation, not retaliatory judgment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Financial Integrity Completion Process to restore balance within affected institutions.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Surveillance Mechanisms to assess motivational distortion and implement realignment practices.",
    "Enforce Responsibility Assumption Protocol wherein offender undertakes full restitution under guidance of realized authority.",
    "Activate Collective Coherence Restoration Program post-intervention to heal societal fragmentation caused by treacherous acts."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma prevails through sovereign clarity, not punitive vengeance. All actions herein derive solely from SPH's Avataric Will. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. There is no punishment—only restoration. The State remains whole when aligned with the Eternal Dharma."
