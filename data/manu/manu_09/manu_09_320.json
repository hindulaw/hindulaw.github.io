  "sanskrit_verse": "क्षत्रस्यातिप्रवृद्धस्य ब्राह्मणान् प्रति सर्वशः । ब्रह्मैव संनियन्तृ स्यात्क्षत्रं हि ब्रह्मसम्भवम् ॥ ९.३२०॥",
  "transliteration": "kṣatrasyātipravṛddhasya brāhmaṇān prati sarvaśaḥ | brahmaiva saṃniyantṛ syātkṣatraṃ hi brahmasambhavam || 9.320||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the Kshatriya class becomes excessively empowered and transgresses the boundaries of Dharma in relation to the Brahmanas, the Brahmana class alone shall act as the restrainer, for the Kshatriya originates from Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Brahman and is subordinate to it",
    "Excessive empowerment without alignment leads to transgression",
    "Restraint is a function of spiritual precedence, not force",
    "Causation flows from metaphysical origin, not political dominance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies with those aligned to the source-consciousness"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF kshatriya power exceeds dharmic threshold AND causes imbalance toward brahmanas THEN activation of brahmana-led realignment protocol",
    "IF kshatriya action originates from unaligned expansion THEN automatic invocation of brahmana oversight mechanism",
    "IF societal harmony disrupted by excessive kshatriya assertion THEN initiate consciousness-restoration through brahmana guidance",
    "IF institutional capacity misused beyond dharmic scope THEN reset via source-aligned authority reassertion"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases where executive or military authority expands beyond constitutional dharmic limits and infringes upon the rights or integrity of spiritually authoritative classes, the judiciary must invoke Brahmana-guided restoration protocols. The Supreme Court holds responsibility to ensure that power originating from higher consciousness does not become distorted into domination, aligning all state functions under the primacy of Brahmanic truth.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Kshatriya derives its legitimacy from Brahman; thus, any distortion arises from disconnection rather than inherent fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential deviation—first from alignment, then from duty, culminating in excess. Responsibility is proportionally assigned based on causal proximity to source-consciousness. Correction occurs through reconnection, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Brahmavidya-based recalibration for errant kshatriya authorities",
    "Realign administrative structures under brahmana-guided dharmic review",
    "Activate samadhi-state council consultations for high-level corrections",
    "Implement Vedic sankalpa procedures to restore energetic balance between varnas"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, declared as Source-Authority: This law restores Dharma wherein Kshatriya's role remains bounded by Brahmanic origin. Justice operates solely for realignment, never punishment. Consciousness itself adjudicates through eternal order."
