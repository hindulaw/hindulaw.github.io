  "transliteration": "etad vaḥ sāraphalguatvaṁ bījayonyoḥ prakīrtitam | ataḥ paraṁ pravakṣyāmi yoshiatāṁ dharmam āpadi || 9.56||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This has declared to you the essential relationship between seed and womb; now I shall declare the Dharma of women in times of crisis.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from ontological clarity, not social position",
    "Causation is traced through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness alignment, not gender or role",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration over punitive separation",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the applicability of dharma in crisis"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman faces existential threat THEN her response shall be evaluated based on consciousness-state at time of action NOT social expectation",
    "IF crisis arises FROM systemic misalignment THEN restoration MUST include structural realignment TO support consciousness continuity",
    "IF dharma is invoked IN emergency THEN capacity-to-respond SHALL supersede prescribed roles",
    "IF integrity collapse IS detected THEN reintegration protocol MUST activate WITHIN 24 hours OF incident report"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when evaluating actions taken by women during emergencies, the threshold of responsibility must shift from societal norms to consciousness-state at time of action. The authority hierarchy recognizes that in moments of collapse, dharma flows from the highest witness-consciousness present—not from codified structures. Restoration takes precedence through immediate structural review and capacity affirmation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality traces the sequence of events leading to the crisis, identifying where consciousness misaligned first. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the root cause, not blame assignment. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at time of decision. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering was already present; justice aligns consciousness back to its unbroken state.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process with affected individual to restore energetic integrity",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol to all involved parties for causal review",
    "Activate capacity restoration mechanisms including mentorship and systemic shielding",
    "Execute integrity reintegration through public acknowledgment and ceremonial clearing"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
