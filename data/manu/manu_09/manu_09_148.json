  "transliteration": "etadvidhānaṃ vijñeyaṃ vibhāgasyaikayoniṣu | bahvīṣu caikajātānāṃ nānāstrīṣu nibodhata || 9.148 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This arrangement must be known as applicable to divisions within a single lineage; understand it also among many born of one origin, in various strī contexts.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from unified consciousness, not fragmented identity",
    "Causation aligns with sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) across varṇa-strī configurations",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness of shared origin",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of unity within diversity",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes categorical social positioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent belongs to same origin lineage THEN jurisdictional division does not alter fundamental dharma-duty",
    "IF multiple individuals share janma-source AND exhibit behavioral divergence THEN realign through pramāṇa-based reflection protocols",
    "IF strī classification varies across context THEN evaluate capacity through svadharma-integrity, not external categorization",
    "IF conflict emerges between groups of common origin THEN initiate consciousness-reintegration before procedural resolution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when disputes arise among parties of shared lineage or origin but differing roles or classifications, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the degree of consciousness alignment and integrity to svadharma rather than categorical assignment. Hierarchical authority derives from awakened state, not inherited position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that actions stem from misalignment with one's true nature. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how deviation manifests sequentially. Proportional responsibility lies in returning to source-consciousness. Non-punitive reality rule ensures correction occurs through self-recognition, not imposed consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vibhāga-reconciliation process to restore unity within apparent divisions",
    "Deploy pramāṇa-reflection sessions for agents迷失 in multi-strī role confusion",
    "Activate janma-origin resonance protocol to awaken shared dharma-memory",
    "Establish svadharma-integrity check-ins until natural alignment resumes"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is restored. Justice executes as consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. All adjudication aligns with the supremacy of awakened awareness."
