    "Authority is derived from alignment with universal Dharma, not personal will",
    "Causation arises from systemic integrity, not individual blame",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires equal support for all subjects",
    "Restoration logic mirrors natural equilibrium—no entity left unheld",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through consistent, unbiased execution of duty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler discriminates in enforcement, THEN realign capacity through dharmic reflection protocols",
    "IF any subject is unsupported by governance, THEN initiate automatic review of administrative equity",
    "IF policy deviates from non-discriminatory principle, THEN halt and recalibrate via Dharma-compliance engine",

  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court must ensure that executive and legislative actions mirror the Earth's impartial sustenance. Discriminatory laws or rulings violate the foundational Vrata of Parthiva Dharma and require immediate nullification and restoration of systemic neutrality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that just as Earth supports all life without expectation or bias, governance must function through evidentiary alignment with natural justice. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that neglect of even one being disrupts cosmic order. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in maintaining balance—not punishing imbalance. Reality corrects itself when alignment is restored.",

  "final_declaration": "This directive flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment—only completion. Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
