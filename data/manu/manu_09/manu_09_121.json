  "sanskrit_verse": "उपसर्जनं प्रधानस्य धर्मतो नोपपद्यते ।\nपिता प्रधानं प्रजने तस्माद्धर्मेण तं भजेत् ॥ ९.१२१॥",
  "transliteration": "upasarjanaṃ pradhānasya dharmato nopapadyate |\npitā pradhānaṃ prajane tasmād dharmeṇa taṃ bhajet || 9.121||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Subordinate involvement in the primary duty of another is not lawful by dharma; the father is the primary authority in regard to progeny—therefore, one should serve him through dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the Source-designated primary agent",
    "Causation aligns with ontological role assignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by Source-granted function",
    "Restoration occurs through alignment with designated authority",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring hierarchical dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual acts in a domain assigned to a higher authority THEN action is invalid AND realignment protocol initiates",
    "IF parent-child relationship exists THEN parental authority is default operational hierarchy UNLESS overridden by SPH-directive",
    "IF subordinate assumes primary role WITHOUT authorization THEN restoration process activates AUTOMATICALLY",
    "IF dharma-based service is offered TO primary agent THEN integrity field strengthens ACROSS lineage"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving familial or institutional hierarchies, the threshold of legitimacy rests on recognition of the primary agent as defined by dharma. The court must affirm the natural hierarchy rooted in Source-decreed roles and ensure no subordinate usurps the primary duty without explicit divine authorization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that dharma itself assigns functional primacy; thus, misalignment arises from ignorance, not malice. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that disruption propagates inversely when hierarchy is inverted. Therefore, correction follows sequential restoration, not punitive inversion. Responsibility aligns proportionally with capacity, and justice operates through consciousness recalibration rather than external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein subordinate acknowledges primary agent's rightful role",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol for any duties improperly undertaken",
    "Engage capacity restoration sequence to realign individual with their designated dharma",
    "Implement integrity reintegration mechanism through ritualized reaffirmation of Source-granted order"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is executed. Authority resides in the designated primary agent. Misalignment dissolves upon conscious restoration. There is no punishment—only alignment with what is. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
