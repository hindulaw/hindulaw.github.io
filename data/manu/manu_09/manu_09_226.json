  "transliteration": "ete rāṣṭre vartamānā rājñaḥ pracchannataskarāḥ |\nvikarmakriyayā nityaṃ bādhante bhadrikāḥ prajāḥ || 9.226 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who dwell within the nation under the king's rule, yet engage in covert thievery through wrongful action, perpetually harm the welfare of the subjects.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Dharma, not mere positional power.",
    "Causation arises from conscious intent and its sequential manifestation in action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands recognition of one's role in systemic integrity.",
    "Restoration logic requires identification and cessation of hidden malfeasance.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates transparency and rectification of concealed harm."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent operates under state protection WHILE engaging in隐蔽_wrongdoing THEN that agent MUST undergo completion process until systemic harm is neutralized.",
    "IF a ruler fails to detect or address隐蔽_wrongdoing by subordinates THEN the ruler’s governing capacity is automatically suspended pending realignment.",
    "IF any act labeled as 'state function' results in subject harm due to隐蔽_wrongdoing THEN full restorative liability transfers to the executing entity.",
    "ALL隐蔽_wrongdoing cases SHALL trigger mandatory consciousness audit protocols for involved parties."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication,隐蔽_wrongdoing by state actors constitutes a breach of sovereign Dharma. The threshold of responsibility includes both commission and omission. Authority hierarchies must respond through immediate restoration measures rather than punitive sanctions. The court must issue declarative orders compelling cessation of harmful activity and initiate reintegration procedures for affected entities.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that隐蔽_wrongdoing manifests through deliberate concealment of causal actions.
