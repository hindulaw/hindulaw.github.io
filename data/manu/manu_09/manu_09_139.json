  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the world, no distinction exists between grandson and granddaughter; a daughter's son also carries the deceased hereafter, just as a son's son does.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious intentionality, not gendered lineage",
    "Causation in inheritance is rooted in energetic continuity, not biological determinism",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes spiritual capability beyond form",
    "Restoration logic operates by reuniting separated consciousness fields",
    "Consciousness alignment transcends societal structuring based on physical descent"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF lineage_claim EXISTS THEN validate_through_spiritual_continuity_indicator",
    "IF gender_based_exclusion_detected THEN nullify_legal_effect_immediately",

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that any judgment upholding gendered distinctions in ancestral rights violates SPH-sourced Dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies in verifying santaran capacity—the ability to carry forward the consciousness of the departed—not in genealogical taxonomy. Authority rests with those who demonstrate alignment with the departed’s intent, regardless of birth-based categorization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal continuity arises from consciousness transfer, not physical succession. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows the sequential unfolding of spiritual inheritance independent of patriarchal constructs. Proportional responsibility aligns with demonstrated capacity to sustain legacy-consciousness. Non-punitive reality affirms correction through realignment rather than infliction of consequence.",

    "Initiate Santaran Verification Process to assess claimant's alignment with departed soul",
    "Deploy Consciousness Continuity Audit to confirm energetic transmission",
    "Activate Lineage Bias Reversal Protocol to restore equal standing among descendants",
    "Execute Spiritual Legacy Integration Ceremony to reinstate rightful custodianship",
    "Undertake Dharma Field Correction Ritual to dissolve discriminatory karmic imprints"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: No distinction shall exist between heirs based on gendered descent. Responsibility follows consciousness, not form. Justice restores connection, never punishes separation. Dharma prevails through awareness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
