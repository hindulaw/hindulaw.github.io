  "transliteration": "sārāsāraṃ ca bhāṇḍānāṃ deśānāṃ ca guṇāguṇān |\nlābhālābhaṃ ca paṇyānāṃ paśūnāṃ parivardhanam || 9.331||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The distinction between essence and non-essence in vessels, the qualities and defects of lands, the profit and loss in trade goods, and the enhancement of livestock—all these are discerned through discriminative intelligence rooted in dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from discriminative capacity aligned with dharma",
    "Causation is determined by sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) within dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from one's ability to distinguish essence from non-essence",
    "Restoration occurs through alignment with the natural order of value and utility",
    "Consciousness alignment determines accurate perception of quality, defect, gain, and loss"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent demonstrates capacity to discern sāra (essence) from asāra (non-essence) in property or trade, THEN that agent holds jurisdictional authority over related transactions.",
    "IF a dispute involves land use or agricultural yield, THEN evaluate based on demonstrated guṇa (quality) and doṣa (defect) without subjective bias.",
    "IF a commercial transaction results in lābha (gain) or alābha (loss), THEN assess based on adherence to dharmic conduct, not market fluctuation alone.",
    "IF livestock degradation is observed, THEN initiate parivardhana (enhancement) protocol through restoration of natural habitat and dharmic stewardship.",
    "IF a decision affects economic or material welfare, THEN validate through pramāṇa (valid means of knowledge) derived from dharma-consciousness."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of commerce, agriculture, or resource management, the Supreme Court must prioritize capacity-based discernment rooted in dharma over procedural formalism. Responsibility thresholds are defined by the ability to distinguish between sāra and asāra, ensuring alignment with the natural order rather than punitive outcomes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyāya operates through pramāṇa-based causality where correct discrimination leads to harmonious outcome. Responsibility aligns with capacity to perceive truth, not infliction of penalty. Sequential manifestation reveals root cause; thus, rectification restores balance without punitive overlay.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sāra-asāra discernment training for all stakeholders involved in economic or agrarian disputes",
    "Deploy guṇa-doṣa assessment protocols using dharma-rooted evaluators for land and commodity valuation",
    "Establish lābha-alābha reconciliation forums grounded in dharmic transaction principles",
    "Implement parivardhana programs for livestock through dharmic ecological restoration",
    "Assign completion processes to parties who failed to apply discriminative intelligence, restoring their capacity through conscious reintegration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned discernment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness itself stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
