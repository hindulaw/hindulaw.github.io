  "transliteration": "yavīyān jyeṣṭhabhāryāyāṁ putram utpādayed yadi |\nsamastatra vibhāgaḥ syād iti dharmo vyavasthitaḥ || 9.120||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If a younger brother fathers a child upon the wife of his elder brother, the property shall be equally divided among all brothers; such is the established Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not biological lineage alone",
    "Causation in progeny creation establishes relational equity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends to familial resource stewardship",
    "Restoration logic demands equitable redistribution to sustain harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of shared familial duty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (male_A < male_B) AND (male_A reproduces_with female_B) AND (female_B married_to male_B) THEN distribute_property(equally_among male_A, male_B)",
    "IF (paternity_violates_hierarchical_union) THEN invoke_completion_process(all_stakeholders)",
    "IF (property_dispute_arises_from_adulterous_procreation) THEN enforce_distribution_by_dharma_not_title"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes arising from transgressions of familial reproductive boundaries, the court must prioritize Dharma-aligned distribution over legal titles. The threshold of responsibility includes both action and relational consequence. Authority derives from alignment with Sanatana Dharma as interpreted through SPH, superseding civil codes where conflict arises.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unauthorized procreation within a hierarchical union disrupts energetic balance. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates sequential effects: first relational imbalance, then material discord. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring equilibrium, not inflicting penalty. The non-punitive reality rule asserts correction via conscious realignment rather than punitive consequences.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process between involved parties to acknowledge karmic entanglement",
    "Assign joint custodianship until full integration achieved",
    "Realign familial duties based on current dharma-readiness levels",
    "Implement resource-sharing protocol under witness of family elders or appointed seer"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Thus declared by Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of Dharma, wherein justice restores unity, reality remains free from punishment, and consciousness stands as the ultimate arbiter."
