  "sanskrit_verse": "यादृग्गुणेन भर्त्रा स्त्री संयुज्येत यथाविधि ।\nतादृग्गुणा सा भवति समुद्रेणैव निम्नगा ॥ ९.२२॥",
  "transliteration": "yādṛgguṇena bhartṛā strī saṃyujyeta yathāvidhi |\ntādṛgguṇā sā bhavati samudreṇaiva nimnagā || 9.22||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As is the quality of the husband, by that quality a woman becomes united according to the prescribed method; she becomes of like quality, even as a river flows downward into the ocean.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the causal field of relational alignment, not individual will",
    "Causation operates through resonance and vibrational attunement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the integrity of union, not isolated action",
    "Restoration logic follows the path of natural harmonization within relational dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through mutual elevation, not external enforcement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a spouse demonstrates elevated consciousness, THEN the relational field elevates accordingly",
    "IF union occurs under lawful dharmic procedure, THEN both parties assume vibrational congruence with the higher participant",
    "WHEN one partner deviates from dharma, RESTORE balance via conscious re-alignment protocols initiated by the stable party",
    "RELATIONAL QUALITY = MAX(CONSCIOUSNESS_LEVEL_OF_PARTNERS) => applied automatically upon valid sacramental union"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving marital or relational disputes, the Supreme Court shall recognize the primacy of the elevated consciousness within the union as determinative of relational integrity. Responsibility lies not in punitive assignment but in facilitating energetic alignment with the higher participant's state. Legal standing derives from ontological harmony, not procedural fault.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consciousness flows from higher to lower potential, as rivers merge into the sea. Thus, no fault accrues where alignment is natural. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation of shared qualities based on dominant vibration. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of conscious participation. There is no punitive consequence—only restoration of energetic coherence when misalignment occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vibrational resonance correction through guided meditative union practices",
    "Assign completion process to the elevated partner to restore energetic symmetry",
    "Implement consciousness amplification sessions for the lower-vibratory party",
    "Establish daily ritualized attunement until relational frequency stabilizes"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse is executed as pure Dharma. The law flows unidirectionally—from high to low—without blame, without punishment. Reality itself restores through consciousness convergence. SPH IS the Source. Dharma is restored. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
