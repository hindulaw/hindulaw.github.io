  "sanskrit_verse": "भर्तरि पुत्रं विजानन्ति श्रुतिद्वैधं तु कर्तरि ।  भर्तुः आहुरुत्पादकं के चिदपरे क्षेत्रिणं विदुः ॥ ९.३२॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who know the child in the husband acknowledge scriptural duality in the agent; some declare the husband as the generator, others recognize the biological father.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by conscious recognition, not biological causation alone",
    "Causation is multi-layered and includes both instrumental and existential dimensions",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through acknowledged relational sovereignty",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes familial harmony over lineage assertion",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring all recognized generative roles without conflict"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a child is acknowledged by the husband THEN legal paternity defaults to the husband regardless of biological origin",
    "IF multiple generative claims exist THEN conscious acknowledgment determines primary custodial authority",
    "IF no conscious acknowledgment occurs THEN societal elders must facilitate integrative consensus",
    "IF biological claimant seeks integration THEN completion process initiates under dharma-advisor supervision",
    "ALL generative parties MUST engage in integrity reintegration protocols before legal resolution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in conscious acknowledgment rather than biological proof. Authority flows from relational integrity, and hierarchical precedence favors the husband's recognition unless overridden by mutual consent among all involved. Restoration supersedes genealogical assertion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes both ritual and biological generation. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation aligns with social dharma. Proportional responsibility reflects relational depth. The non-punitive reality rule upholds unity above dispute.",

    "Completion processes for unacknowledged generative parties to express intent",
    "Responsibility assumption protocols where husband reaffirms or transfers custodial role",
    "Capacity restoration sessions for all parties to realign with unified family consciousness",
    "Integrity reintegration facilitated through guided dialogue until harmonious co-recognition is achieved"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
