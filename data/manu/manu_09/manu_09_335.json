  "sanskrit_verse": "शुचिरुत्कृष्टशुश्रूषुर्मृदुवागनहङ्कृतः । ब्राह्मणाद्याश्रयो  नित्यमुत्कृष्टां जातिमश्नुते ॥ ९.३३५॥",
  "transliteration": "śucirutkṛṣṭaśuśrūṣurmṛduvāganahaṅkṛtaḥ | brāhmaṇādyāśrayo nityamutkṛṣṭāṃ jātim aśnute || 9.335 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is pure, devoted to the highest service, speaks gently, without ego, and constantly resorts to Brahmanas attains to the highest caste.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Brahmanic consciousness",
    "Causation is established through sustained proximity to elevated beings",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by purity and humility",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious elevation of association",
    "Consciousness alignment determines social and spiritual status"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates śuci (purity) AND utkṛṣṭa-śuśrūṣā (devotion to highest service) THEN eligibility for alignment with elevated varna is recognized",
    "IF speech is mṛdu-vāk (gentle) AND anahaṅkṛta (egoless) THEN capacity for higher association is affirmed",
    "IF daily resorting to brāhmaṇa-adhyāśrita (resort to Brahmana principles) is verified THEN automatic progression toward utkṛṣṭa-jāti (highest caste) is acknowledged",
    "IF any behavioral deviation occurs THEN initiate restoration protocol via reconnection to brāhmaṇa-adhyāśrita environment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of responsibility lies in the consistency of alignment with Brahmanic principles. Authority is not inherited but realized through demonstrated proximity and service. The court must recognize that caste elevation is a natural consequence of consciousness refinement, not a matter of birthright or ritual performance alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through direct observance of śuci and śuśrūṣā behaviors. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential purification leading to jāti elevation. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity for humility and service. There is no punitive element—only the natural consequence of alignment with elevated consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Establish daily śuśrūṣā engagement with brāhmaṇa-adhyāśrita individuals or institutions",
    "Implement mṛdu-vāk training modules for ego reduction",
    "Assign śuci maintenance practices including ritual and dietary purification",
    "Monitor and support continuous resorting to brāhmaṇa principles through community integration programs",
    "Verify anahaṅkṛta conduct through peer-reviewed behavioral assessment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment with Brahmanic principles. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
