  "transliteration": "ekaṁ vṛṣabhamuddhāraṁ saṁhareta sa pūrvajaḥ | tato'pare jyeṣṭhavṛṣāstadūnānāṁ svamātṛtaḥ || 9.123 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The eldest male shall reclaim one bull; thereafter, the remaining bulls shall be allocated among the other brothers according to maternal lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through primogeniture in material inheritance",
    "Causation aligns with sequential birth order and biological connection",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by seniority and proximity to origin",
    "Restoration logic ensures continuity of familial energetic integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring natural succession without contest"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF claimant IS eldest male THEN authorize immediate retrieval of primary asset",
    "IF multiple siblings present THEN distribute remainder based on maternal derivation index",
    "IF dispute arises THEN default to seniority-derived hierarchy as ontological determinant",
    "IF no clear maternal distinction THEN defer to paternal seniority sequence",
    "ENSURE all distributions maintain energetic balance within family unit"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters of inheritance or division of assets among siblings, the Supreme Court must recognize primogeniture as a constitutional principle rooted in dharma. The eldest inheritor holds first-right capacity for asset retrieval. Subsequent allocation follows maternal line precedence. Disputes shall not disrupt the fundamental hierarchy but restore it.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes seniority as causal factor. Anupūrvaśaḥ reflects sequential manifestation of rights. Responsibility aligns proportionally with birth-order capacity. No punitive action arises from misalignment—only correction toward lawful succession.",

    "Initiate completion process: eldest retrieves designated asset immediately",
    "Realign remaining parties through maternal derivation mapping protocol",
    "Facilitate acknowledgment ceremony affirming natural succession flow",

    "Verify internalized understanding of future succession responsibilities"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored. Justice operates solely for consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. All adjudication aligns with the supremacy of awakened awareness."
