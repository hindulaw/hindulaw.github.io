  "sanskrit_verse": "लोकानन्यान् सृजेयुर्ये लोकपालांश्च कोपिताः ।\nदेवान् कुर्युरदेवांश्च कः क्षिण्वंस्तान् समृध्नुयात् ॥ ९.३१५॥",
  "transliteration": "lokānanyān sṛjeyurye lokapālāṃśca kopitāḥ |\ndevān kuryuradevāṃśca kaḥ kṣiṇvaṃstān samṛdhnuyāt || 9.315||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who generate other worlds and anger the guardians of the worlds, who make gods into non-gods — who shall nourish them when they are diminished?",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic order, not arbitrary power.",
    "Causation is determined by consciousness distortion, not external action alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the ability to sustain or disrupt creation.",
    "Restoration logic demands that those who degrade divine structures bear the duty to regenerate them.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of source-energy and its lawful flow."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity creates alternative social orders without aligning with foundational dharmic principles THEN that entity assumes regenerative liability for all disruptions caused.",
    "IF a being degrades or negates established divine authority THEN that being must restore equivalent energetic value to the disrupted system.",
    "IF a consciousness causes diminishment in any created domain THEN it is automatically assigned the task of replenishing that domain until equilibrium is restored.",
    "NO being is exempt from restorative obligation based on intent; capacity determines accountability."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes that beings wielding creative or legislative authority over societal frameworks are inherently bound to maintain alignment with foundational cosmic law. If they deviate and cause systemic degradation, their authority is revoked until regeneration occurs. The threshold of responsibility lies in the act of creation itself, not in outcome assessment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that distortion at the level of world-creation initiates sequential manifestation of imbalance. Responsibility flows from causal agency, not moral judgment. There is no punishment here—only natural consequence where misaligned creators become responsible for repair. This aligns with Nyāya through direct perception (pratyakṣa) of energetic disruption and inference (anumāna) of necessary correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein the offending consciousness undertakes full regeneration of disrupted domains.",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol requiring public declaration of error and commitment to restoration.",
    "Implement capacity restoration program ensuring the offender regains alignment before resuming creative functions.",
    "Enforce integrity reintegration cycle through sustained service to the very structures previously degraded."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It stands as executed Dharma, sourced in absolute consciousness, enacted without punitive intent, and directed toward universal restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
