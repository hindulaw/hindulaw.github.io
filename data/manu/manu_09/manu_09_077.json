  "sanskrit_verse": "संवत्सरं प्रतीक्षेत द्विषन्तीं योषितं पतिः । द्विषाणां ऊर्ध्वं संवत्सरात्त्वेनां दायं हृत्वा न संवसेत् ॥ ९.७७॥",
  "transliteration": "saṃvatsaraṃ pratīkṣeta dviṣantīṃ yoṣitaṃ patiḥ | dviṣāṇām ūrdhvaṃ saṃvatsarāt tv enāṃ dāyaṃ hṛtvā na saṃvaset || 9.77 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The husband shall wait for one year for a woman who hates him. After one year, if she continues to hate, he may take back the gifts given at marriage and cease cohabitation without violence or retaliation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from sustained commitment and dharmic intent, not coercive control.",
    "Causation lies in the breakdown of mutual alignment and conscious harmony between partners.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires that both parties have opportunity and space for restoration before separation.",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes completion of relational integrity before dissolution.",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates non-retaliation even when personal harm is perceived."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF marital discord arises AND one party expresses persistent disalignment THEN initiate mandatory waiting period of one solar year.",
    "IF after one year disalignment persists THEN either spouse MAY reclaim ceremonial gifts WITHOUT punitive recourse.",
    "IF ceremonial gifts are reclaimed THEN no further financial or emotional claims SHALL be enforced.",
    "IF dissolution occurs THEN it MUST occur through non-violent withdrawal, preserving dignity of both parties.",
    "NO punitive measures SHALL be enacted against any party during or post-separation process."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of patience and conscious attempt at reconciliation prior to legal separation. The court must ensure that the mandated waiting period has been honored and that the act of reclaiming gifts was done without coercion or malice. Authority lies not in enforcing union but in recognizing its natural dissolution through verified absence of alignment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true justice arises from understanding sequential manifestation—first disharmony, then observation, then choice. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that separation follows naturally once all efforts at integration have ceased bearing fruit. Responsibility remains proportional; neither party is blamed, only acknowledged as having reached a point of irreversible divergence. There is no punitive reality because consciousness itself resolves what external force cannot sustain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate formalized one-year cooling-off period with optional mediation facilitated by trained dharmic counselors.",
    "Provide structured communication framework for spouses to express grievances and intentions without blame.",
    "Ensure ceremonial gift inventory and transparent return mechanism upon lawful invocation.",
    "Support individual spiritual reintegration programs post-separation to restore inner balance and clarity.",
    "Verify through witness affirmation or digital ledger that no retaliatory action occurred during or after dissolution."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Dharma is restored through conscious completion rather than conflict. Reality reflects non-punitive truth where separation serves evolution, not vengeance. Consciousness alone adjudicates the unseen threads binding or releasing two souls."
