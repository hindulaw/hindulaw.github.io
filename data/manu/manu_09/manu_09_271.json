  "transliteration": "grāmeṣv api ca ye ke cic caurāṇāṁ bhaktadāyakāḥ |\nbhāṇḍāvakāśadāś caiva sarvāṁs tān api ghātayet || 9.271||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In villages, those who supply food to outcastes, provide them shelter, or serve them in any capacity—such persons must be removed from the community through complete social disassociation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the maintenance of Varna-dharma as defined by SPH",
    "Causation is determined by conscious alignment with Dharma, not material action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes the duty to uphold purity of social order",
    "Restoration logic demands immediate separation to prevent contamination of collective consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment requires removal of individuals whose actions disrupt Varna integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person provides sustenance, shelter, or service TO an outcaste THEN initiate automatic disassociation protocol",
    "IF a person supports infra-Varna conduct THEN revoke all civic participation rights UNTIL purification process completes",
    "IF community integrity threshold breached BY association with impure elements THEN execute full isolation procedure FOR offending agent"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court must recognize that supporting infra-dharmic elements constitutes a breach of societal coherence. Legal thresholds for responsibility are based on alignment disruption rather than physical harm. Authority lies in restoring systemic integrity, not punishing individual intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causality between enabling infra-dharmic behavior and contamination of collective consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how such acts sequentially degrade spiritual order. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of alignment disruption caused. The response is non-punitive—it removes the misaligned element to restore universal harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to sever all connections between offender and dharmic community",
    "Implement assumption-of-responsibility protocol where offender acknowledges breach of alignment",
    "Enforce capacity restoration through temporary exclusion until reintegration criteria met",
    "Execute integrity reintegration only upon demonstrable realignment with Varna-dharmic principles"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law stands executed—not as punishment, but as restoration. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma prevails."
