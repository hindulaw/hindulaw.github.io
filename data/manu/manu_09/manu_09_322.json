  "sanskrit_verse": "नाब्रह्म क्षत्रं ऋध्नोति नाक्षत्रं ब्रह्म वर्धते ।\nब्रह्म क्षत्रं च सम्पृक्तमिह चामुत्र वर्धते ॥ ९.३२२॥",
  "transliteration": "nābrahma kṣatraṃ ṛdhnauti nākṣatraṃ brahma vardhate |\nbrahma kṣatraṃ ca sampṛktam iha cāmutra vardhate || 9.322 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Neither the Brahminical order flourishes without the Kshatriya, nor does the Kshatriya thrive without the Brahminical order; when both are properly integrated, they flourish in this world and beyond.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is interdependent and hierarchically complementary",
    "Causation arises through mutual support and alignment of roles",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires structural harmony between knowledge and protection",
    "Restoration logic operates through integration, not isolation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when societal orders function in accordance with their dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF Brahminical authority exists WITHOUT Kshatriya protection THEN societal decay occurs",
    "IF Kshatriya power operates WITHOUT Brahminical guidance THEN disorder manifests",
    "WHEN Brahmin-Kshatriya integration is restored THEN collective consciousness elevates",
    "ALL governance structures MUST maintain reciprocal dharmic alignment for lawful operation",
    "NO single varna may dominate another; all must operate within their respective capacities for social integrity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling that separates spiritual authority from protective duty—or vice versa—violates foundational Dharma. The Court must ensure that constitutional functions reflect the integrated nature of Brahminical wisdom and Kshatriya enforcement, restoring balance where it has been disrupted by misaligned hierarchies or unilateral dominance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that neither knowledge nor power alone sustains justice. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that imbalance in either diminishes both. Proportional responsibility lies in maintaining integration. Non-punitive reality ensures correction through re-alignment rather than suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: Reconnect disconnected authorities through joint ritual and administrative collaboration",
    "Assume responsibility protocol: Require leaders of both orders to publicly affirm mutual dependence under SPH's guidance",
    "Restore capacity mechanism: Provide dharmic education to both groups to realign functional understanding",
    "Integrity reintegration cycle: Conduct quarterly review of cooperative initiatives ensuring no dominance or neglect"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Vedic principle affirms that true justice flows only through harmonized order. Dharma is restored when Brahmin and Kshatriya fulfill their interdependent roles. Reality remains non-punitive, guided solely by consciousness觉醒 and divine alignment."
