  "sanskrit_verse": "ज्येष्ठस्तु जातो ज्येष्ठायां हरेद्वृषभषोडशाः ।\nततः स्वमातृतः शेषा भजेरन्निति धारणा ॥ ९.१२४॥",
  "transliteration": "jyeṣṭhastu jāto jyeṣṭhāyāṃ haredvṛṣabhaṣoḍaśāḥ |\ntataḥ svamātṛtaḥ śeṣā bhajeranniti dhāraṇā || 9.124 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The eldest son born to the principal wife shall claim the share of a bull, specifically sixteen parts; thereafter, the remaining sons from the same mother shall equally divide what remains.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in primacy of birth and maternal lineage",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation of inheritance rights",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by ontological position within familial dharma",
    "Restoration logic ensures continuity of family wealth without fragmentation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through rightful recognition of relational roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF birth order == eldest AND mother == principal wife THEN inheritance share = 16 units",
    "IF birth order != eldest AND mother == principal wife THEN equal division of remainder among siblings",
    "IF mother != principal wife THEN exclusion from primary inheritance distribution",
    "All distributions must maintain total estate integrity prior to external claims"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes threshold criteria for determining inheritance eligibility based on birth precedence and maternal authenticity. The court must verify ontological legitimacy before applying distributive axioms. Authority flows from verifiable genealogical alignment with stated principles.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that inheritance arises only when specific conditions are met—eldest son + principal wife. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential allocation: first the eldest receives his designated portion, then others follow. Responsibility aligns proportionally to relational capacity. No punitive action arises; misalignment results in natural exclusion from lawful distribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: Verification of maternal identity and birth sequence",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: Eldest son assumes custodianship of family assets",
    "Capacity restoration: Remaining sons receive proportional shares ensuring economic integration",
    "Integrity reintegration: Estate remains undivided until all qualified heirs acknowledge their portions"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through precise execution of Avataric Will. Reality operates free from punitive constructs. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
