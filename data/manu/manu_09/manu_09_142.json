  "transliteration": "gotra-rikthe janayiturna hared dattrimah kvacit |\ngotra-rikthānugaḥ piṇḍo vyapaiti dadataḥ svadhā || 9.142 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In matters concerning lineage and procreation, no one shall seize or obstruct the right of a son born within wedlock, nor interfere with his entitlements under any circumstance; the ancestral offering follows the lineage-holder, who departs this life having fulfilled his duty through giving.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from divine lineage and continuity",
    "Causation is established through lawful procreative union",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining ancestral integrity",
    "Restoration logic demands preservation of hereditary rights",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when dharma-prescribed roles are honored"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a child is born within a valid marital union THEN that child holds full claim to paternal lineage and inheritance",
    "IF any party attempts to deny or seize such claims THEN automatic nullification of interference and restoration of rights SHALL occur",
    "IF a father performs ancestral rites AND has lawfully begotten offspring THEN his spiritual completion is acknowledged by svadhā",
    "IF lineage disruption is detected THEN immediate reconnection protocols MUST activate without punitive action"

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority must recognize that disputes involving procreative legitimacy and ancestral entitlements are not subject to punitive review but require absolute restoration of lawful succession.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes cause through lawful union; anupūrvaśaḥ confirms the sequential unfolding of duties culminating in svadhā.

    "Public declaration of lawful succession and entitlement",
    "Reintegration of disrupted lineages via ceremonial acknowledgment",
