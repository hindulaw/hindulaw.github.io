  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As is the Self, so is the son; by the son, the daughter is equal. When she abides in that Self, how can another take her wealth?",

    "Authority originates from the Self's recognition within the family continuum",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating inheritance disputes involving daughters, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying the daughter’s abidance in the Self. Authority flows from this recognition rather than patriarchal constructs. The court must ensure restoration of rightful ownership based on ontological equality, not procedural claims.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that equality between children derives from their shared essence in the Self. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misalignment occurs when external forces challenge this natural order. Proportional responsibility rests with those who disturb the harmony.
