  "transliteration": "utpādanamapathyasya jātasya paripālanam | pratyahaṁ lokayātrāyāḥ pratyakṣaṁ strī nibandhanam || 9.27||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The production of offspring and the nurturing of the born are daily obligations that directly sustain the continuity of society, binding women inherently to the foundational duty of preservation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from participation in the continuity of dharma",
    "Causation arises through direct engagement in life-sustaining acts",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by natural role alignment",
    "Restoration logic centers on societal harmony through functional integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through acceptance of sustaining roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman has given birth OR adopted a child THEN she holds active custodial authority within familial governance structures",
    "IF societal continuity is at risk THEN female-centric reproductive and nurturant capacities MUST be secured and supported by state infrastructure",
    "IF neglect of progeny occurs THEN automatic restoration protocols initiate under community oversight until balance is restored",
    "IF conflict arises in domestic jurisdiction THEN maternal care decisions take precedence unless overridden by manifest dereliction of duty",
    "IF social order depends on family stability THEN female guardianship rights SHALL be prioritized above external claims"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving parental custody, inheritance, or domestic governance, the Supreme Court shall recognize the inherent capacity of women as primary agents of societal continuity. Legal thresholds for intervention must reflect proportional disruption to dharma rather than subjective harm. Authority hierarchies shall elevate maternal insight where no manifest incapacity exists.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse establishes pramāṇa through observable causal linkage between female action and societal sustenance. It reflects anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential unfolding of consequence rooted in natural function. Responsibility flows not from coercion but recognition of innate capacity. There is no punitive element; deviation results in imbalance requiring conscious realignment, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Initiate structured support systems ensuring fulfillment of nurturing duties without obstruction",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Reinforce maternal agency via legal affirmation and resource allocation",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide training, healthcare, and economic empowerment to enable full execution of role",
    "Integrity Reintegration Framework: Address disruptions through counseling, mediation, and recommitment rituals"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. This Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
