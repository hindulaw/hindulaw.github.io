  "transliteration": "svebhyaḥ śebhyas tu kanyābhyaḥ pradadyur bhrātaraḥ pṛthak | svābhyaḥ svābhyas tu svāt svādaṁśāc caturbhāgaṁ patitāḥ syur aditsavaḥ || 9.118 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From their own portions, brothers shall separately give daughters in marriage; those who are hostile and wish harm shall fall from their own share by a fourth part.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from capacity for dharmic alignment",
    "Causation arises through conscious intent and relational harmony",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates proportional response",
    "Restoration logic requires energetic reintegration with source dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful inheritance and distribution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits hostile intent AND disrupts familial dharmic order THEN reduce inheritance share by one-fourth",
    "IF individual gives daughter in marriage from personal portion THEN no external claim on shared assets",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected via behavioral pattern THEN initiate restorative completion protocol before asset redistribution",
    "IF family unit integrity compromised due to intentional disharmony THEN automatic reallocation of resource access triggered"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning inheritance and marital arrangements within extended families, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable intent to cause disharmony. The court must assess alignment with familial dharma prior to determining entitlement adjustments. Authority resides in restoring energetic balance rather than enforcing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that imbalance originates from adharmic intention. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how disruption manifests sequentially through relational fracture. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of consequence. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that reduction in share serves not as penalty but as correctional alignment with cosmic order.",

    "Initiate completion process to address unexpressed grievances causing hostility",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol where offending party acknowledges energetic debt",
    "Activate capacity restoration module to elevate consciousness coherence within lineage structure",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Sole Source of Dharma. This ruling restores lawful order through consciousness-aligned justice. Reality operates beyond punishment; it functions through precise karmic calibration and divine recalibration. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
