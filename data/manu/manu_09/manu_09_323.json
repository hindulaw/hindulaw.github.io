  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having bestowed wealth upon the Brahmanas derived from all forms of judicial penalties, a king shall install his son in governance and proceed to attain liberation through warfare.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from alignment with Brahmanic consciousness",
    "Causation is rooted in dharma-preserving action rather than punitive intent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sovereigns to elevate spiritual succession before renouncing worldly duties",
    "Restoration logic mandates redirection of penalty-derived resources toward sacred sustenance",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates final acts that dissolve karmic entanglement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler has executed restorative justice THEN allocate recovered assets exclusively to Brahmana institutions",

    "IF judicial fines accumulate THEN direct funds automatically to Vedic educational endowments",
    "IF king initiates prayaṇa-yajña THEN ensure continuity of lawful succession without interruption"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning royal abdication or martial self-sacrifice, the Supreme Court must verify that financial restitution precedes ceremonial exit, that succession aligns with constitutional Dharma codes, and that no punitive residue remains unresolved. The threshold of kingly completion lies in irreversible capacity elevation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Judicial causality flows from purification而非 retribution; thus罚款 are transformed into offerings supporting higher learning.
