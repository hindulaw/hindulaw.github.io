  "transliteration": "bhṛtyānāṁ ca bhṛtiṁ vidyād bhāṣāś ca vividhā nṝṇām | dravyāṇāṁ sthānayogāṁś ca kravikrayameva ca || 9.332 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must know the compensation due to servants, the various languages of people, the proper placement and utility of objects, and the principles of buying and selling.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from accurate knowledge of relational and transactional dharmas",
    "Causation arises through right understanding of roles, value, and exchange",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes recognition of service, communication, and resource alignment",
    "Restoration logic requires correction of misaligned economic and linguistic interactions",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when all parties engage in transactions with clarity and dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a servant's rightful compensation is withheld, THEN initiate completion process for payment AND realign employer's financial awareness",

    "IF物品 are misplaced or misused, THEN execute spatial-dharma realignment AND assign custodial responsibility based on capacity",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that ignorance of compensation structures, linguistic plurality, spatial utility, or transactional integrity constitutes a failure of dharma-advisory duty. Responsibility lies with those who hold authority over such domains to ensure alignment with cosmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies that imbalance in compensation, communication, placement, or trade reflects distorted cognition.
