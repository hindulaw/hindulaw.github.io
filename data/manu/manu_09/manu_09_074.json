  "transliteration": "vidhāya vṛttiṁ bhāryāyāḥ pravaset kāryavān naraḥ |\navṛttikarśitā hi strī praduṣyet sthitim aty api || 9.74 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A man engaged in duties must arrange for the sustenance of his wife before departing. For a woman, when deprived of sustenance, even if restrained, becomes corrupted in conduct.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from capacity to sustain and protect",
    "Causation arises from failure to fulfill existential obligations",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is non-transferable and context-bound",
    "Restoration logic requires re-establishment of dharma-sustaining structures",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through harmonious fulfillment of svadharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a husband departs without ensuring sustenance for the wife THEN legal departure status = invalid UNTIL provision is secured",
    "IF a wife's sustenance is unmet THEN system-initiated support protocol = activated AND spousal accountability = enforced",
    "IF conduct deviation occurs in spouse due to deprivation THEN corrective action = restoration of provision NOT punitive measures",
    "IF individual acts within svadharma THEN societal harmony = maintained ELSE systemic correction = initiated"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of marital duty and departure, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable capacity to provide. The court shall recognize that failure to uphold existential obligations creates conditions conducive to misconduct, which must be addressed through restoration of lawful order rather than punitive attribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that absence of sustenance directly causes deterioration in conduct. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation: lack of provision → loss of stability → deviation in behavior. Proportional responsibility rests solely on the provider. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction lies in reinstating dharma, not inflicting consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sustenance verification protocol upon report of spousal departure",
    "Assign temporary caretaking mechanism until permanent arrangement is established",
    "Engage community dharmadhikari to mediate realignment of household dharma",
    "Enforce completion process wherein provider assumes full provisioning responsibility"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma is hereby restored through alignment with svadharma. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
