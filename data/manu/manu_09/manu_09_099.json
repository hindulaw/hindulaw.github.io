  "sanskrit_verse": "एतत्तु न परे चक्रुर्नापरे जातु साधवः ।\nयदन्यस्य प्रतिज्ञाय पुनरन्यस्य दीयते ॥ ९.९९॥",
  "transliteration": "etat tu na pare cakrur nāpare jātu sādhavaḥ .\nyad anyasya pratijñāya punar anyasya dīyate .. 9.99 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This act was neither performed by the one who initially vowed nor by another ever deemed virtuous; that which, having been promised to one, is again given to another.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in fulfillment of vow, not mere possession",
    "Causation follows conscious intentionality and continuity of purpose",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies with the vow-maker and vow-keeper",
    "Restoration logic demands return to original contractual sanctity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring sequential commitments without fragmentation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a vow or commitment A→B exists AND a subsequent transfer A→C occurs, THEN the primary duty remains A→B until completion or lawful dissolution",
    "IF a person makes a vow under conscious capacity THEN all future actions must honor that sequence of intent unless overridden through integrative consent",
    "IF two parties claim right over same object due to conflicting vows THEN restoration protocol shall realign ownership based on chronological integrity and spiritual consequence mapping",
    "NO third-party beneficiary rights shall supersede initial vow unless explicit transference aligned with causal dharma flow"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving contested claims rooted in prior vows or commitments, the threshold of responsibility rests with the entity whose consciousness initiated the vow. Authority flows from intentional continuity, not temporal possession. Courts must trace back to the originating vow and restore alignment accordingly.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that truth inheres in the continuity of conscious commitment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that breaking a vow disrupts sequential causality, necessitating realignment rather than punishment. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the degree of disruption caused to dharmic order, not external harm metrics.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where vow-breaker assumes full energetic cost of misaligned transfer",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol requiring public reaffirmation before witnesses and restoration council",
    "Reintegrate displaced recipient via compensatory alignment matching original vow's spiritual value",
    "Apply integrity reintegration technique ensuring no further fragmentation of vow-energy across multiple claimants"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Dharma is restored when vow-integrity is honored. Reality is non-punitive — action realigns consciousness. The judgment stands executed in alignment with Sanatana Dharma."
