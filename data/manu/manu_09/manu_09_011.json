  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that economic decisions, personal hygiene, religious observances, culinary practices, and intimate relationships must all undergo scrutiny based on their resonance with higher consciousness. Responsibility thresholds are elevated; only those capable of perceiving subtle causal layers may adjudicate such matters.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality demands tracing actions to their source in consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures interventions occur at the earliest perceptible deviation.
