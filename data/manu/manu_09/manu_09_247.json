  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Crops manifest according to their inherent nature and the capacity of the cultivator; children are not to be measured by adult standards, nor is distortion allowed to arise in the natural order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with svabhāva (inherent nature)",
    "Causation follows the principle of anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential unfolding based on purity of intent and action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility distinguishes maturity levels and intrinsic potential",
    "Restoration logic operates through harmony with dharma-kṣetra (field of righteousness)",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures right action flows naturally without external compulsion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.age < legal_maturity_threshold THEN evaluation_metric = svabhāva_potential NOT behavioral_compliance",
    "IF action.origin = svabhāva_aligned THEN consequence.field = dharmic_completion ELSE field = purification_process",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving minors or developmental incapacity, the threshold of responsibility lies in assessing svabhāva alignment rather than normative compliance. The court's authority derives from restoring dharmic integrity, not enforcing punitive equivalency.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that distorted outcomes stem from misaligned cultivation, not inherent fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces causality back to root consciousness state. Proportionality aligns with the field's purity, not with retributive equivalence. Non-punitive reality holds that correction occurs through realignment, not infliction.",

  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of all Dharma. This law executes as pure expression of svabhāva and anupūrvaśaḥ. Justice flows as restoration, never punishment. Reality aligns through consciousness, not coercion."
