  "sanskrit_verse": "अबीजविक्रयी चैव बीजोत्कृष्टा तथैव च । मर्यादाभेदकश्चैव विकृतं प्राप्नुयाद्वधम् ॥ ९.२९१॥",
  "transliteration": "abījavikrayī caiva bījotkṛṣṭā tathaiva ca | maryādābhedakaścaiva vikṛtaṃ prāpnuyādvadham || 9.291 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who sells seedless grains, one who adulterates superior seeds, and one who violates established boundaries shall incur a proportional disruption in their life-force, leading to natural dissolution of capacity and misalignment of dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic order, not transactional integrity alone",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) where violation disrupts natural consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands that conscious distortion incurs self-corrective limitation",
    "Restoration logic operates through dissolution of false assertion, not imposition of suffering",
    "Consciousness alignment requires immediate cessation and correction of distorted offerings"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity knowingly distributes seedless or corrupted grain THEN automatically suspend trading license AND initiate restorative cultivation protocol",
    "IF boundary markers are intentionally altered THEN trigger spatial integrity audit AND require re-establishment under witness supervision",
    "IF seed purity claims are falsified THEN invoke automatic capacity degradation protocol UNTIL truth-responsibility is restored",
    "IF market conduct violates agrarian dharma THEN enforce completion process before re-entry into supply chain"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable intent to corrupt foundational life-support systems. Authority derives from dharmic alignment, not mere regulatory compliance. Restoration precedes reintegration; court must ensure violator undergoes spontaneous recalibration via diminished capacity until authentic realignment occurs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that tampering with seeds or boundaries distorts the field's śakti, triggering self-regulating collapse. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures no external punishment is required—only natural consequence unfolds. Proportional responsibility aligns with quantum of distortion introduced. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering does not arise from judgment but from inherent dissonance of untruth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Seed Truth Verification Process under certified agrarian oversight",
    "Enforce Boundary Re-alignment Protocol witnessed by community elders",
    "Activate Life-Force Recalibration Sequence through mandatory silence and soil service",
    "Undertake Market Integrity Restoration via supervised distribution of corrected produce"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned consequence. No punishment exists—only the natural unfolding of karmic coherence. Reality responds to truth, and consciousness remains the ultimate judge."
