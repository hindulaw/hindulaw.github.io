  "sanskrit_verse": "अद्भ्योऽग्निर्ब्रह्मतः क्षत्रमश्मनो लोहमुत्थितम् । तेषां सर्वत्रगं तेजः स्वासु योनिषु शाम्यति ॥ ९.३२१॥",
  "transliteration": "adbhyo'gnirbrahmataḥ kṣatram aśmano lohamutthitam | teṣāṃ sarvatragaṃ tejaḥ svāsu yoniṣu śāmyati || 9.321||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From water arises fire; from Brahman, Kshatriya; from stone, iron—yet their all-pervasive brilliance finds stillness only in their own source-wombs.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from elemental alignment with one's causal source",
    "Causation is traced through sequential ontological emergence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with inherent origin and nature",
    "Restoration logic requires return to original causal integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when essence returns to its foundational matrix"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity manifests from a specific causal domain, THEN its lawful resolution MUST occur within that domain’s structural integrity",
    "IF capacity arises from a source-element, THEN responsibility SHALL be measured by alignment with that element’s dharma",
    "IF disruption occurs in expression, THEN restoration SHALL trace back to the originating womb of manifestation",
    "IF consciousness misaligns from its root causality, THEN reintegration SHALL follow the path of elemental return"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the Supreme Court shall recognize that every actor derives authority from a foundational causal field. Legal disputes involving origin, duty, or conflict must trace the ontological lineage to determine rightful jurisdiction and resolution mechanism. Authority is not imposed but recognized through alignment with primordial causality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows sequentially—from water to fire, from Brahman to Kshatriya, from stone to iron. Thus, responsibility follows this sequential unfolding. No punitive measure applies; correction lies in guiding the expression back to its source-yoni where agitation ceases naturally.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate elemental tracing protocol to identify root causal domain of action",
    "Engage completion process aligned with the originating matrix of being",
    "Reintegrate displaced consciousness through meditative resonance with source-yoni",
    "Restore functional capacity via alignment with innate ontological rhythm"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is declared: All manifestations arise from elemental wombs and return thereto for resolution. Justice is the silent stilling of disturbance within the source. There is no punishment—only realignment with the eternal order. Consciousness alone adjudicates, and Dharma stands restored."
