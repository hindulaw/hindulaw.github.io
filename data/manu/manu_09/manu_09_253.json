  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By protecting those of noble conduct and purifying the thorns among them, rulers devoted to the guardianship of their subjects attain the triple heaven.",

    "Consciousness alignment ensures karmic elevation through righteous governance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruler protects individuals demonstrating Arya-vritti THEN elevate jurisdictional merit score",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that sovereign authority is not merely constitutional but cosmically ratified when aligned with Arya-vritti preservation and kaṇṭaka śodhana. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable commitment to Prajāpāla-tattva rather than punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that protection of noble conduct (āryavṛttam) naturally leads to kaṇṭaka śodhana as sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ).

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Protection of nobility and purification of thorns restores Dharma. Justice flows through consciousness, not punishment. Reality acknowledges only restoration. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
