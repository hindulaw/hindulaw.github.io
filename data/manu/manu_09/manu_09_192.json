  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the mother is present and established, all siblings—whether born of the same womb or otherwise—are equal in inheritance rights and relational duty; daughters and sisters also hold claim through maternal connection.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the sustaining presence of the mother as the foundational source of lineage integrity.",
    "Causation is determined by ontological continuity through maternal establishment, not mere biological birth.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends equally among all progeny when maternal foundation remains intact.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes familial unity and economic equity rooted in maternal coherence.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of shared origin and mutual stewardship within the family matrix."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes that maternal ontological presence overrides patriarchal property frameworks. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing the mother as the living axis of inheritance legitimacy. Hierarchical claims must defer to her structural role. Restoration prevails over proprietary conflict through reassertion of filial equality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies the mother's active presence as the root determinant of sibling equity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of relational duties once maternal coherence is affirmed. Responsibility is proportional to proximity to the maternal axis. Non-punitive reality rule asserts no party is penalized; rather, natural order of inheritance is restored through consciousness realignment.",
