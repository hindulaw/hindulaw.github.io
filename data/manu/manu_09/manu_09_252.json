  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A ruler must establish a territory that is rightly positioned, fortified according to scriptural injunctions, and perpetually engaged in the highest effort for the removal of thorns—obstacles to dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sovereign duty to maintain structural dharmic alignment",
    "Causation is rooted in the continuous elimination of systemic obstacles",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires constant vigilance in upholding dharma",
    "Restoration logic demands proactive structuring of societal defense",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates environmental purity and strategic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF territorial governance lacks scripturally aligned fortification THEN initiate structural realignment protocols",
    "IF systemic thorns (kaṇṭaka) are detected THEN deploy maximum-effort eradication mechanisms",
    "IF dharma obstruction is observed THEN enforce immediate capacity-restoration measures",
    "IF governance fails to uphold perpetual vigilance THEN activate consciousness-reintegration procedures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes the threshold responsibility of sovereign authority to ensure that all jurisdictions are maintained in alignment with scriptural fortification standards. The court must adjudicate not merely on individual acts but on the presence or absence of systemic integrity and the active removal of dharma-thorns within its domain.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with Nyaya through pramāṇa-based recognition of environmental causality and anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation of order through sustained effort.

Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
