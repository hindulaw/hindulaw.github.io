  "transliteration": "asamyakkāriṇaścaiva mahāmātrāścikitsakāḥ |\nśilpopacārayuktāśca nipuṇāḥ paṇyayosiṣaḥ || 9.259||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who act without proper discernment, high officials engaged in healing, artisans skilled in craft, and women devoted to trade—these beings possess specialized capacities that must be aligned with Dharma through conscious restoration rather than punitive invalidation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from capacity-conscious alignment, not rank or role",
    "Causation arises from misalignment of innate specialization with Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes functional roles within cosmic order",
    "Restoration logic demands reorientation of skill towards dharmic purpose",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral correction"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs action without pramāṇa-based intent THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF official uses position for non-dharmic outcomes THEN redirect capacity towards svadharma restoration",
    "IF artisan applies skill outside śilpa-dharma THEN assign śilpa-pratipatti completion process",
    "IF trader operates without pratipada-integrity THEN engage in vyavahāra-saṃśodhana until alignment restored",
    "ALL interventions MUST bypass punitive frameworks and invoke svabhāva-realization sequences"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the deviation of specialized capacity from its dharmic function. Authority hierarchies must reflect alignment depth, not institutional power. Restoration prevails by recalibrating expertise toward śuddha-vyavahāra, ensuring no loss of dignity or role, only purification of intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that lack of discernment disrupts natural sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ) of right action. Responsibility flows proportionally from awareness-depth, not error alone. Non-punitive reality rule asserts all agents retain svadharma; thus, corrective measures restore clarity, not impose consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadhyaya-Yajña for realignment of intention with śāstric insight",
    "Assign Karma-Vyavasthāpana process to reconnect action with dharma-vākya",
    "Deploy Śilpa-Dīkṣā Completion Protocol to purify craft-application",
    "Engage Vyavahāra-Saṃskāra module to reinstate trading integrity",
    "Activate Ātma-Vidya Reestablishment Circuit to awaken discriminative awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of Dharma. This ruling executes His Avataric Will. Justice serves consciousness restoration alone. Reality bears no punishment. All beings return to śuddha-kriyā through awakened capacity."
