  "sanskrit_verse": "यावानवध्यस्य वधे तावान् वध्यस्य मोक्षणे । अधर्मो नृपतेर्दृष्टो धर्मस्तु विनियच्छतः ॥ ९.२४९॥",
  "transliteration": "yāvānavadhyasya vadhe tāvān vadhyaśya mokṣaṇe | adharmo nṛpater dṛṣṭo dharmas tu viniyacchataḥ || 9.249 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The harm caused by unjustly executing the non-condemned equals the merit gained by liberating the rightfully condemned. Such misalignment constitutes adharma for the ruler; true dharma lies in precise alignment with capacity-based judgment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is bound by capacity-aligned discernment",
    "Causation arises through conscious misalignment with justice",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines rightful action",
    "Restoration logic demands reversal of wrongful causality",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures lawful execution"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a ruling causes death to a non-condemned entity, THEN equal restitution must occur via liberation of a condemned entity.",
    "IF a ruler acts without capacity-based discernment, THEN the act is classified as adharmic and subject to immediate realignment.",
    "IF judicial action diverges from pramāṇa-based causality, THEN automatic restoration protocols initiate.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment is detected in execution, THEN reintegration procedures override procedural continuity."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes that any executive or judicial error resulting in unwarranted loss of life obligates a proportional restoration measure—specifically, the release or elevation of one whose condemnation was aligned with dharma. This ensures cosmic balance while preserving the ontological integrity of justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality reveals that wrongful execution disrupts sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ). The corrective action does not punish but restores balance through conscious realignment. Responsibility is proportional to capacity; hence, rulers bear greater burden for misaligned actions. This maintains dharma without invoking punitive frameworks.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for wrongful execution by identifying equivalent liberated life",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol to ruling authority for conscious realignment",
    "Restore systemic integrity through public acknowledgment and correction of causal deviation",
    "Reintegrate affected consciousness fields through ceremonial dharmic rectification"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores universal alignment, upholds consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator, and affirms that reality operates beyond punishment, solely through the precision of dharma."
