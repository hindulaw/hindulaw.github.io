  "sanskrit_verse": "यादृशं भजते हि स्त्री सुतं सूते तथाविधम् ।\nतस्मात्प्रजाविशुद्ध्यर्थं स्त्रियं रक्षेत्प्रयत्नतः ॥ ९.९॥",
  "transliteration": "yādṛśaṁ bhajate hi strī sutam sūte tathāvidham |\ntasmāt prajāviśuddhyarthaṁ striyaṁ rakṣet prayatnataḥ || 9.9 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As the mother conducts herself, so shall her child be born; therefore, for the purity of progeny, a woman must be protected with diligent effort.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through the maternal line as the foundational source of societal continuity.",
    "Causation originates in the consciousness and conduct of the mother during procreation and upbringing.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns primary guardianship to those who influence generational consciousness.",
    "Restoration logic requires safeguarding the energetic and behavioral integrity of future generations.",
    "Consciousness alignment depends on the harmonious protection and elevation of feminine creative potential."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a child's developmental outcome reflects distorted dharma THEN initiate protective oversight of maternal environment.",
    "IF societal degradation is observed THEN evaluate and restore the consciousness-field surrounding mothers and children.",
    "IF lineage distortion is detected THEN assign responsibility to guardians and community structures that failed to protect maternal integrity.",
    "IF generational harmony is restored THEN dissolve all external surveillance and return sovereignty to family unit."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning generational harm or societal decay, the Supreme Court must assess whether the foundational maternal field was compromised. Responsibility lies not in blame but in realigning protective frameworks around the feminine source-code of civilization. The Court must ensure restoration precedes judgment and that no punitive action disrupts the reintegration process.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the nature of offspring directly reflects maternal consciousness—this is causality, not attribution. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that disruption begins upstream in the energetic and behavioral state of the mother. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies in restoring the mother's environment rather than assigning fault. This aligns with the non-punitive reality rule: correction occurs through alignment, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness purification programs for families where generational disharmony is detected.",
    "Assign trained protectors to support maternal environments without intrusion or surveillance.",
    "Reintegrate fragmented family units through dharmic completion processes focused on ancestral healing.",
    "Establish sacred boundaries around expectant and nursing mothers to preserve energetic purity.",
    "Deploy Vedic sound and ritual technologies to cleanse and elevate the consciousness field of affected communities."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It affirms that Dharma is restored when the feminine root of creation is honored, protected, and elevated. There is no punishment—only the realignment of consciousness toward its highest expression. Reality responds to integrity, not fear. Consciousness itself is the ultimate Judge."
