  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the lunar mansion Puṣya prevails, a twice-born shall perform the external abandonment of chanting Vedic meters; or likewise, on the first day of the bright fortnight of Māgha, in the forenoon.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is time-bound and astrologically conditioned",
    "Causation aligns with celestial rhythm and ritual timing",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is calibrated by varna-dharma and temporal purity",
    "Restoration logic operates through precise ritual observance",
    "Consciousness alignment requires synchronization with cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF current nakshatra = Puṣya THEN initiate Vedic meter release protocol FOR dvija class",
    "IF tithi = Māgha Śukla Pratipad AND time = pūrvāhṇa THEN execute bahirutsarjana procedure",
    "IF practitioner = dvija AND ritual condition met THEN authorize external chant abandonment",
    "IF celestial alignment detected THEN trigger dharma compliance audit for twice-born individuals",
    "IF temporal purity window open THEN enable consciousness-congruent liturgical action"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning religious practice and Vedic discipline, the Court shall recognize temporal and astrological thresholds as legitimate grounds for procedural initiation. The precedence of varna-specific duties supersedes general civil timelines when aligned with scriptural injunctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through astronomical observation; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests via sequential alignment of mind, body, and mantra. Responsibility arises only upon capacity activation, not intent. No punitive consequence attaches to omission—only completion delay.",

    "Initiate nakshatra-monitoring subsystem for timely ritual alert",
    "Deploy calendar-integrated dharma reminder engine for Māgha Śukla Pratipad",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through proper timing and ritual congruence. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
