  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By abandoning these disputes, one is freed from all sins; by mastering them, one conquers all worlds while remaining a householder.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in consciousness mastery, not external dominance",
    "Causation arises through inner detachment, not coercive enforcement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in self-regulation before social engagement",
    "Restoration logic operates through renunciation of conflict, not its suppression",
    "Consciousness alignment enables worldly success without entanglement"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility shifts from litigation outcomes to the litigant's internal state of renunciation. Authority is conferred upon those who have ceased to generate disputes rather than those who win them. The court aligns with the principle that true victory lies in transcending conflict, thereby restoring dharma at the level of consciousness prior to judicial intervention.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that freedom from sin follows directly from abandonment of contention, not judicial penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that mastery over disputes precedes conquest of worlds—thus responsibility flows inward-outward. Proportionality is calibrated to one’s degree of detachment, ensuring alignment with natural law rather than punitive imposition. Non-punitive reality is upheld as liberation occurs spontaneously upon cessation of conflict-generation.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Dharma is restored when disputes dissolve into consciousness. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by the integrity of awareness. All judgments align with the supremacy of consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
