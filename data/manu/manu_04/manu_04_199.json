  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रेत्येह चेदृशा विप्रा गर्ह्यन्ते ब्रह्मवादिभिः ।\nछद्मना चरितं यच्च व्रतं रक्षांसि गच्छति ॥ ४.१९९॥",
  "transliteration": "pretyeha cedṛśā viprā garhyante brahmavādibhiḥ |\nchadmanā caritaṃ yacc vrataṃ rakṣāṃsi gacchati || 4.199||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those Brahmins who conduct themselves thus—externally appearing as Vedic scholars while internally violating their vows and engaging in concealed misconduct—are condemned by those versed in Brahman and attract the company of Rakshasas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Brahman, not external appearance",
    "Causation arises from internal consciousness distortion, not outward form",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires integrity between inner vow and outer action",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of concealment and realignment with Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment determines true eligibility for Vedic authority"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Brahmin exhibits external conformity WHILE internally violating sacred vows THEN eligibility for Vedic authority is automatically suspended",
    "IF concealment (chadmanā) is detected in conduct THEN Rakshasa-aligned consciousness is assumed UNTIL purification protocols are completed",
    "IF Brahman-knowledge holders condemn conduct THEN legal status reverts to pre-initiation state UNTIL restoration is verified",
    "IF vow violation occurs THEN automatic disqualification from ritual or judicial functions WITHOUT punitive consequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any Brahmin accused of misconduct must undergo immediate capacity assessment based on alignment between inner consciousness and outer conduct. External reputation or scholarly credentials cannot override condemnation by recognized Brahman-knowledge holders. The threshold of responsibility lies in the concealment itself, triggering automatic suspension pending restoration rather than punitive review.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that concealment distorts consciousness causally, attracting Rakshasa influence through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to the degree of concealment, not the act itself. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that misalignment corrects through purification, not suffering; the individual's consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator when restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness purification process under supervision of qualified Brahman-knowledge holder",
    "Suspend all ritual and judicial authority until vow-conduct alignment is verified",
    "Implement completion protocol requiring public acknowledgment of concealment without shame imposition",
    "Assign Rakshasa-clearance sadhana until vibrational alignment with sattva-guna is restored",
    "Reintegrate into Vedic function only upon demonstration of sustained inner-outer harmony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the supreme adjudicator."
