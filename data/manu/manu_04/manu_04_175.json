  "transliteration": "satyadharmāryavṛtteṣu śaucaṁ caivārametsadā |\nśiṣyāṁśca śiṣyāddharmeṇa vāk.bāhūdarasaṁyataḥ || 4.175||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must always remain established in truth, righteousness, noble conduct, and purity; and one must instruct disciples according to dharma through speech, hands, belly, and eyes—meaning by word, action, sustenance, and attention.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from alignment with Satya-Dharma",
    "Causation rooted in consciousness-led instruction",
    "Capacity-based responsibility through embodied teaching",
    "Restoration logic via dharmic mentorship structures",
    "Consciousness alignment through disciplined sensory engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a teacher's conduct deviates from satya-dharma THEN realign through supervised mentorship protocols",

    "IF disciple shows disconnection THEN initiate reintegration via purified verbal, physical, nutritive, and attentive guidance",
    "IF purity of instruction is breached THEN enforce completion process for both instructor and instructed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that jurists and educators hold responsibility not only in formal rulings but also in the mode of transmission—verbal, gestural, metabolic, and perceptual. Misalignment at any level mandates conscious restoration rather than punitive removal.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here includes the full spectrum of human expression as valid evidence of alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates sequential misalignment begins internally before manifesting externally. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to transmit dharma. There is no punitive consequence—only obligation to restore integrity within the field of instruction.",

    "Initiate guided retreat for realignment with satya-dharma",
    "Assign corrective mentorship under qualified authority",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through alignment with truth, discipline, nobility, and purity. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all actions."
