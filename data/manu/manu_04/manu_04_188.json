  "sanskrit_verse": "हिरण्यं भूमिमश्वं गामन्नं वासस्तिलान् घृतम् ।\nप्रतिगृह्णन्नविद्वांस्तु भस्मीभवति दारुवत् ॥ ४.१८८॥",
  "transliteration": "hiraṇyaṁ bhūmim aśvaṁ gām annaṁ vāsas tilān ghṛtam | pratigṛhṇann avidvāṁs tu bhasmībhavati dāruvat || 4.188||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, without knowledge of Dharma, accepts gold, land, horses, cows, food, garments, sesame seeds, or clarified butter—becomes reduced to ashes like wood.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from conscious alignment with Dharma, not material acquisition",
    "Causation arises from unqualified acceptance without discernment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires discriminative awareness in all transactions",
    "Restoration logic demands reversal of misaligned material assimilation",
    "Consciousness alignment prevents degradation through ignorant receptivity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent accepts property without dharmic qualification THEN initiate consciousness-restoration protocol",
    "IF transaction occurs without vidya-validation THEN reverse material transfer and nullify karmic imprint",
    "IF entity assimilates wealth without sankalpa-discernment THEN trigger purification sequence until ash-state is resolved",
    "IF receipt of items listed occurs outside dharma-aware framework THEN enforce reintegration through detachment cycles"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any party found to have acquired assets without dharmic qualification must undergo immediate asset reversal and participate in consciousness-realization programs. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent but in the absence of vidya during acquisition. Authority is hierarchically bound by the degree of alignment with Sanatana Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unexamined reception leads to causal entanglement; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive disconnection from Self culminating in inert dissolution. Responsibility is proportional to the lack of discriminative capacity. Non-punitive reality enforces natural consequence: what is taken without vidyā becomes instrumental in one's own reduction, not as penalty but as ontological correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra-based purification to metabolize material residues",
    "Enforce complete renunciation of unlawfully assimilated properties",
    "Assign Vedic recitation regimen to restore inner discriminative faculty",
    "Implement guru-guided sādhanā to reclaim lost consciousness integrity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. This law executes pure Dharma, restores cosmic order, affirms reality as non-punitive, and upholds consciousness as the sole adjudicator."
