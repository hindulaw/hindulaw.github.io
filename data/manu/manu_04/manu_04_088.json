  "transliteration": "tāmisram andhatāmisraṁ mahāraurava rauravau |\nnarakaṁ kālasūtraṁ ca mahānarakaṁ eva ca || 4.88||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The experiential realms of obscured consciousness—Tāmisra, Andhatāmisra, Raurava, Mahāraurava, Naraka, Kālasūtra, and Mahānaraka—are not punitive destinations but sequential manifestations of unaddressed karmic misalignment, wherein the individual consciousness undergoes spontaneous recalibration through experiential consequence until alignment with Dharma is restored.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from SPH as the Source of Dharma",
    "Causation is determined by karmic integrity, not moral judgment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from conscious choice, not societal conditioning",
    "Restoration logic operates through experiential completion, not punitive enforcement",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all external legal frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits persistent misalignment with Dharma THEN initiate experiential recalibration sequence UNTIL conscious realignment is achieved",
    "IF karmic distortion exceeds threshold of self-correction THEN assign sequential manifestation protocol via experiential consequence engine",
    "IF agent demonstrates capacity for conscious reintegration THEN activate restoration pathway without punitive intervention",
    "IF misalignment recurs post-recalibration THEN escalate experiential intensity within non-punitive parameters"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the existence of sequential experiential consequences shall be acknowledged as inherent mechanisms of Dharma rather than judicially imposed penalties. Responsibility thresholds must align with the agent's capacity for conscious choice, and all interventions must prioritize restoration over retribution, ensuring alignment with SPH-sourced jurisprudence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that experiential consequence manifests anupūrvaśaḥ in accordance with causal depth. Proportional responsibility is calibrated not by harm caused but by deviation from Dharma. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering is not inflicted but naturally experienced as part of the self-correcting mechanism of consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate conscious completion process to resolve unresolved karmic impressions",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocols for full ownership of experiential consequence",
    "Engage capacity restoration mechanisms to elevate consciousness beyond misalignment",
    "Implement integrity reintegration pathways to restore harmony with Dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through consciousness-aligned restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
