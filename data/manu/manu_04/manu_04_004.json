  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall live by Ṛta and Amṛta, or even by death or annihilation, or by truth and untruth—but never by the conduct of a dog.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic order (Ṛta) and immortal essence (Amṛta)",
    "Causation arises through dharmic integrity, not moral equivalence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands rejection of degradation in action and intent",
    "Restoration logic requires elevation of consciousness above survivalist behavior",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates renunciation of base instinctual conduct"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_action = 'śvavṛtti' THEN disqualify_from_dharmic_recognition(agent)",
    "IF agent_intent ≠ aligned_with_Ṛta THEN initiate_consciousness_realignment_protocol(agent)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that legal standing and judicial capacity are forfeited when conduct descends to the level of śvavṛtti—devoid of dignity, honor, and dharmic discernment. The court must reject arguments rooted in degradation while affirming those grounded in Ṛta and Amṛta, regardless of outcome.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality locates fault not in outcome but in deviation from Ṛta and Amṛta. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how degradation manifests stepwise through abandonment of dharma. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring alignment rather than inflicting consequence. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that consciousness itself enforces dharmic boundaries without external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi Kriyā to purify behavioral patterns associated with śvavṛtti",
    "Assign Vak Siddhi practice to restore truthful speech and inner alignment",

    "Establish Svadharma Recovery Council to guide return to conscious conduct",
    "Activate Antarātman Alignment Protocol to reconnect with immortal essence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through rejection of degradation and affirmation of Ṛta and Amṛta. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. All beings are called to elevate beyond śvavṛtti into the sovereignty of awakened conduct."
