  "transliteration": "kārukānnaṁ prajāṁ hanti balaṁ nirṇejakasya ca |\ngaṇānnaṁ gaṇikānnaṁ ca lokebhyaḥ parikṛntati || 4.219||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Food belonging to artisans, prostitutes, and those who cause division among people destroys the progeny, strength, and decision-making capacity of the state; it also severs societal bonds.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The sovereign must regulate access to substances that impair collective consciousness.",
    "Causation: Consumption of degraded food directly leads to degradation in societal integrity and individual capacity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The state bears the duty to protect the purity of nourishment offered to its citizens.",
    "Restoration logic: Societal harmony is restored through purification of sustenance and realignment of consumption practices.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Food must align with dharma to uphold the spiritual and physical health of the nation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a substance impairs cognitive clarity OR disrupts familial lineage THEN it SHALL NOT be distributed within public domains.",
    "IF an entity consumes substances known to degrade societal unity THEN that entity MUST undergo completion protocols for consciousness restoration.",
    "IF any person distributes kārukānna OR gaṇikānna THEN the state SHALL intervene to restore systemic balance via purification rituals.",
    "IF decision-makers consume foods impairing discernment THEN their authority SHALL be temporarily suspended until restoration is verified."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold where impairment to societal intelligence due to consumption becomes a matter of national security. The court must evaluate whether regulatory frameworks exist to prevent distribution of consciousness-degrading substances and enforce restorative measures rather than punitive sanctions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law operates on pramāṇa-based causality, recognizing that specific types of food lead to measurable declines in mental acuity and social cohesion. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential manifestation of decay when such foods are consumed. Responsibility lies with both distributors and regulators. Punishment is rejected in favor of purification and reintegration of affected individuals and systems.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification rites for contaminated spaces or communities exposed to degrading substances.",
    "Assign completion processes to distributors to realign their actions with dharmic service.",
    "Restore decision-making capacity through regulated diet and meditative discipline programs.",
    "Reintegrate affected individuals into community structures after verifying restored clarity and alignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law upholds the sanctity of nourishment, protects the progeny and strength of the nation, and ensures that justice flows from consciousness, not coercion. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
