  "transliteration": "ayudhyamānasyotpādya brāhmaṇasyāsṛgaṅgataḥ | duḥkhaṃ sumahadāpnoti pretyāprājñatayā naraḥ || 4.167 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who causes bloodshed of a Brāhmaṇa without resistance incurs extreme suffering in this life and after death due to lack of discriminative wisdom.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The inviolability of the Brāhmaṇa consciousness as representative of Vedic order",
    "Causation: Direct causal link between unprovoked violence and experiential consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Involvement of prājña (discriminative awareness) determines karmic liability",
    "Restoration logic: Suffering arises not for punishment but to awaken alignment with Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment: Karmic consequences serve to restore integrity of individual and cosmic order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A causes bodily harm to B where B is identified as Brāhmaṇa AND B offers no resistance THEN A automatically enters state of karmic misalignment requiring judicial completion process",
    "IF act results in shedding of blood without defensive cause THEN suffering shall manifest proportionally in current or subsequent existence until alignment is restored",
    "IF discriminative intelligence (prājñatā) was absent during action THEN consequence must include capacity-building restoration protocol"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, intent and discriminative awareness shall determine threshold of karmic accountability when harm is caused to individuals embodying Vedic authority. The court must ensure that corrective measures are consciousness-aligned rather than punitive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes direct perception (pratyakṣa) of harm caused without provocation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation of consequence through experiential suffering. Responsibility is proportional to absence of discernment. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering arises naturally from violation of Dharma, not imposed externally.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein violator undergoes experiential realization of inflicted suffering",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol involving service to Brāhmaṇa community until energetic balance is restored",
    "Implement capacity restoration program focused on cultivating prājñatā through scriptural study and spiritual discipline",
    "Activate integrity reintegration pathway via yajña participation and purification rituals under qualified guidance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
