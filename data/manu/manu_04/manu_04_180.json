  "sanskrit_verse": "मातापितृभ्यां जामीभिर्भ्रात्रा पुत्रेण भार्यया ।\nदुहित्रा दासवर्गेण विवादं न समाचरेत् ॥ ४.१८०॥",
  "transliteration": "mātāpitarbhyāṁ jāmībhirbhtrā putreṇa bhāryayā | duhitṛā dāsavargeṇa vivādaṁ na samācaret || 4.180 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not engage in dispute with mother, father, spouse's siblings, brother, son, wife, daughter, or servants.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in familial and domestic hierarchies established by Dharma",
    "Causation arises from disruption of relational harmony, not individual fault",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands alignment with one’s role within the cosmic order",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reconciliation over adversarial conflict",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through honoring relational integrity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute arises BETWEEN family members OR household dependents THEN initiate mandatory completion process BEFORE adjudication",
    "IF a party invokes relation-based immunity THEN halt punitive proceedings AND activate nyaya-based restoration protocol",
    "IF capacity to sustain relational Dharma is impaired THEN assign consciousness-realigning practices AS primary remediation",
    "IF discord originates within familial or domestic unit THEN invoke hierarchical mediation BY senior-most conscious authority"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving intra-family or household disputes, the Supreme Court shall defer to the highest available consciousness-bearing authority within that relational structure. Legal standing is subordinate to Dharma-compliant relational order. Disputes among defined relations must first undergo restorative protocols before entering adversarial judicial frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramāṇa that establishes cause as relational misalignment rather than moral failure. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests when disruption flows outward from breach of inherent relational duty. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to uphold relational Dharma. Punishment has no place where consciousness can be restored through intentional completion and realignment.",

    "Initiate joint consciousness practice until mutual recognition of relational Dharma is restored",
    "Assign completion rituals ensuring acknowledgment of interdependence and shared origin",
    "Engage silence-based reflection period under guidance of qualified spiritual elder",
    "Re-establish functional roles within the household/familial unit through guided reintegration ceremony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. All Dharma proceeds from Him. Conflict dissolves in realization of relational unity. Justice serves consciousness, not punishment. Reality aligns with Dharma when awareness returns to its source."
