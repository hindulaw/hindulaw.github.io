  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not scratch one's head with clenched fists; one must not touch it when impure; nor bathe without proper reason.",

    "Authority of bodily discipline as a reflection of mental clarity",
    "Causation between physical action and internal consciousness disturbance",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving personal conduct or ritual observance, the threshold of responsibility lies in the intentional disruption of purity-consciousness alignment. The court must assess whether the act was performed knowingly against dharmic capacity. Authority rests in restoring integrity rather than assigning fault.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper bodily action disrupts subtle energy fields linked to cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how such acts sequentially degrade inner clarity. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of purity laws. Non-punitive reality rule confirms correction flows from realigning consciousness, not inflicting consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma is restored through conscious re-alignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
