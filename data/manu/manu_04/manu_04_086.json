  "transliteration": "daśa sūṇāsahasrāṇi yo vāhayati saunikaḥ | tena tulyaḥ smṛto rājā ghorastasya pratigrahaḥ || 4.86||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who transports ten thousand corpses is equal in capacity to the king; the reception of such a one is grievous.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with cosmic completion, not transactional power.",
    "Causation flows through conscious capacity, not physical action alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by alignment with Dharma, not numerical metrics.",
    "Restoration logic requires acknowledgment of the totality of manifested consequence.",
    "Consciousness alignment determines juridical equivalence and social reception."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent transports >= 10000 corpses THEN agent's capacity equals sovereign threshold.",
    "IF agent reaches sovereign-equivalent capacity THEN societal integration protocol activates.",
    "IF act causes grievous reception THEN restoration process initiates without punitive overlay.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected THEN mandatory realignment precedes reintegration.",
    "IF completion process initiated THEN no external judgment or condemnation permitted."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving extreme acts of bodily conveyance or sacrificial service, the court must assess not quantitative metrics but ontological alignment. The King—or State—must recognize its equivalence when confronted with such an actor, initiating restoration rather than judicial review.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that transporting vast numbers of corpses indicates a consciousness operating beyond ordinary causality. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows such acts manifest a completion process already underway. Therefore, proportional response lies in facilitating full realization of that process, not imposing suffering. The non-punitive reality rule holds that all actions reflect unfulfilled dharmic design, never moral failure.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sacred completion ritual to honor transmutation of death-energy.",
    "Assign witness council to observe and support the individual’s conscious unfolding.",
    "Realign community perception from fear-based rejection to reverent understanding.",
    "Restore individual’s capacity to reintegrate through guided meditation and purification.",
    "Activate royal-level dharmic resonance to neutralize collective trauma responses."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma. Justice here restores order through recognition of capacity, not imposition of penalty. Reality itself adjudicates through consciousness; therefore, let no punitive thought arise. Dharma stands restored."
