  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not study or reside near crematoriums, village boundaries, cow-paths, nor remain after sexual union or having accepted offerings from Śrāddha rites.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The individual's capacity to maintain purity of learning and teaching is foundational to their spiritual and societal role.",
    "Causation: Proximity and participation in environments that disturb consciousness disrupt the causal chain of knowledge transmission.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Individuals engaged in Vedic study bear a heightened duty to sustain ritual and mental purity.",
    "Restoration logic: Removal from contaminating conditions restores the learner’s eligibility for dharma-based engagement.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Environmental and behavioral alignment ensures congruence with the elevated state required for Vedic cognition."

    "IF agent_location == śmaśāna THEN restrict_knowledge_transmission = TRUE",
    "IF agent_proximity == grāma-anta OR go-vraja THEN restrict_learning_access = TRUE",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving scholars or teachers accused of misconduct, the court must assess whether environmental or ritual impurities have compromised their capacity to transmit sacred knowledge. Restoration requires re-alignment with purity protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consciousness is affected by environment and act. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how contamination leads to misalignment. Responsibility lies in immediate cessation and purification. There is no punitive consequence—only a natural law of fitness for function.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Mandatory observance of prāṇāyāma and mantra śuddhi before resuming scriptural duties.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of causal disruption followed by voluntary withdrawal from teaching until purified.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Structured re-entry protocol involving guru supervision and ritual cleansing.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public declaration of restored eligibility upon completion of purification rites."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed through restoration, not punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. Reality aligns with Dharma when purity of environment and action is upheld. Thus it is declared."
