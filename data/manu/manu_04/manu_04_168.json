  "sanskrit_verse": "शोणितं यावतः पांसून् सङ्गृह्णाति महीतलात् । तावतोऽब्दानमुत्रान्यैः शोणितोत्पादकोऽद्यते ॥ ४.१६८॥",
  "transliteration": "śoṇitaṃ yāvataḥ pāṃsūn saṅgṛhṇāti mahītalāt | tāvato'bdānamutrānyaiḥ śoṇitotpādako'dyate || 4.168 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The one whose blood causes the earth to absorb dust and impurities for as long as it takes for the production of new blood shall bear the responsibility of sustaining life-force equilibrium through equivalent restorative action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Prakriti's balance",
    "Causation arises from direct impact on environmental harmony",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is proportional to regenerative capacity",
    "Restoration logic operates through energetic equivalence",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of bio-energetic interdependence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity’s biological emission disrupts terrestrial absorption capacity THEN that entity MUST engage in equivalent bio-restorative activity",
    "WHEN blood-derived karmic residue exceeds environmental assimilation threshold THEN initiate consciousness-realigning purification protocol",
    "CALCULATE karmic debt via duration × intensity × environmental disruption factor",
    "RESTORE balance THROUGH directed pranic rejuvenation cycles aligned with natural rhythm"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving bodily emissions impacting ecological stability, the Supreme Court must assess not intent nor negligence, but the measurable energetic imbalance caused. Responsibility lies strictly with the causal agent until such time as restoration is verifiably complete.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through observed correlation between blood-efflux and soil-absorption degradation. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential depletion of earth's purificatory strength. Responsibility is neither assigned arbitrarily nor enforced punitively; it is activated by the condition itself and resolved through conscious completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate mandatory grounding and soil-nourishment rituals for duration equal to disruption period",
    "Assign breath-regulation and prana-infusion practices to regenerate lost vitality",
    "Implement supervised reconnection with elemental forces until resonance is restored",
    "Undertake public service actions aimed at revitalizing degraded land zones"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma flows from recognition of cause, correction through conscious effort, and completion without punishment. The Earth bears witness, and consciousness adjudicates."
