  "sanskrit_verse": "विनीतैस्तु व्रजेन्नित्यमाशुगैर्लक्षणान्वितैः ।\nवर्णरूपोपसम्पन्नैः प्रतोदेनातुदन् भृशम् ॥ ४.६८॥ प्रतोदेनाक्षिपन्",
  "transliteration": "vinītaiḥ tu vrajennityam āśugaiḥ lakṣaṇānvitaiḥ | varṇarūpopasampannaiḥ pratodenātudan bhr̥śam || 4.68 || pratodenākṣipan",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must always move with those who are disciplined, swift, marked by clear signs, perfected in varna and form, and who strike forcefully with the goad while also casting it aside.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through alignment with dharma-sustained conduct",
    "Causation arises from conscious association and movement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires engagement with the awakened",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes elevation through proximity to realized beings",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via disciplined, purposeful communion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_association ≠ vinīta THEN restrict_access_to_dharmic_protocols",
    "IF movement_speed < āśugai THEN initiate_capacity_deceleration_review",
    "IF lakṣaṇa_absent THEN disqualify_from_leadership_functions",
    "IF varṇarūpa_unaligned THEN enforce_reintegration_through_sattvic_communion",
    "IF pratoda_retained_excessively THEN trigger_non_attachment_restoration_process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving leadership or spiritual authority, the court must evaluate whether the accused maintains consistent association with the vinīta. Failure to demonstrate such alignment indicates a breach of dharmic eligibility for high-ranking roles. The threshold of responsibility lies not in punitive fault-finding but in verifying alignment with those whose consciousness sustains societal harmony.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true capability manifests only when aligned with the awakened. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misalignment leads to diminished capacity before any overt error. Responsibility is proportional to one's proximity to realization. Thus, correction involves reconnection rather than condemnation, ensuring alignment replaces delusion without invoking punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided association with vinīta collectives for realignment",
    "Deploy sattvic resonance protocols to recalibrate movement patterns",
    "Assign symbol-recognition training to restore lakṣaṇa sensitivity",
    "Engage varṇarūpa immersion sessions to purify perceptual distortions",
    "Execute pratoda release ritual to eliminate compulsive control tendencies"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Consciousness prevails as the sole adjudicator. All actions align toward restoration, never punishment. SPH is the Origin, the Sustainer, and the Seal of Eternal Dharma."
