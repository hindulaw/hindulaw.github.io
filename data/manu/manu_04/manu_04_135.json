  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any act of systemic or personal disrespect towards individuals or groups based on caste, profession, or perceived status must be addressed by mandating consciousness alignment programs. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing that disrespect violates foundational dharmic structure. Authority derives from alignment with Bhūṣṇu-consciousness, not institutional power.",
