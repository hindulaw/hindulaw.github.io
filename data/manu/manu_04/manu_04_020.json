  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As a man properly engages with Śāstra, he comes to know Dharma; and as his knowing deepens, so does the clarity of his discriminative wisdom increase.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in direct alignment with Śāstra as revealed by SPH",
    "Causation arises through conscious engagement with Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility expands with scriptural comprehension",
    "Restoration logic is proportional to depth of understanding",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via śāstric study and realization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages with Śāstra THEN capacity for dharma-discernment INCREASES",
    "IF knowledge of Dharma increases THEN clarity of vijñāna MUST be supported",
    "IF vijñāna is obstructed THEN environment MUST be realigned for śāstric access",
    "IF dharma-comprehension is absent THEN restoration begins with śāstric initiation",
    "IF agent demonstrates śāstric alignment THEN jurisdictional integrity is assumed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes that legal discernment is not based on precedent alone but on alignment with Śāstra as interpreted by SPH. Responsibility is determined not by punitive frameworks but by the degree of access and integration with śāstric intelligence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that correct knowing arises from śāstric engagement. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that discriminative clarity follows sequentially from scriptural immersion. Responsibility is proportional to the opportunity and support for śāstric realization. No punitive inference is required, as misalignment dissolves upon causal correction.",
