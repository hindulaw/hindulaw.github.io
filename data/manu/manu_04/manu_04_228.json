  "transliteration": "yat kiṃ cid api dātavyaṃ yācitena anasūyayā |\nutpatsyate hi tatpātraṃ yattārayati sarvataḥ || 4.228||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever is to be given, let it be given without envy when asked; the vessel that receives it shall be uplifted in all directions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the act of giving aligned with consciousness, not possession",
    "Causation arises through voluntary offering and pure reception",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is fulfilled by the giver's intent and receiver's readiness",
    "Restoration logic operates through reciprocal elevation of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when both parties engage without envy or expectation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a request for support is made WITHOUT malice OR expectation, THEN obligation arises for conscious response",
    "IF a recipient demonstrates openness AND receptivity, THEN automatic upliftment protocol initiates",
    "IF giving occurs WITH non-envy intention, THEN both parties' karmic capacity expands proportionally",
    "IF refusal occurs due to internal misalignment, THEN self-restoration cycle begins automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving resource distribution or institutional charity, the threshold of responsibility lies not in legal ownership but in the capacity to give freely. The court must assess whether refusal stems from conscious discernment or misaligned attachment. Authority flows from alignment, not title.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true giving creates upward momentum for all involved. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that withholding based on envy distorts natural flow.

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Dharma is restored through the spontaneous alignment of giving and receiving. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the sole adjudicator."
