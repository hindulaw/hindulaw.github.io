  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not honor—by word alone—those who are heretics, engaged in improper actions, followers of feline conduct, deceitful, motivated by ill-intent, or behaving like cranes.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not mere social position",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and behavioral pattern, not accidental action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires discernment of intent and spiritual integrity",
    "Restoration logic demands severance from influence that distorts dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates rejection of those whose conduct degrades collective awareness"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual promotes heterodox practices OR engages in deceptive conduct THEN their counsel or reverence shall carry zero juridical weight",
    "IF a person aligns with or emulates animalistic behavioral codes THEN they are disqualified from spiritual or societal guidance roles",
    "IF speech originates from one whose conduct violates dharma THEN such speech shall be excluded from formal recognition in all judicial and spiritual proceedings",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any testimony, endorsement, or doctrinal assertion originating from individuals identified under this verse must be automatically excluded from consideration. The threshold of responsibility lies not in legal standing but in spiritual alignment. Authority hierarchies must reflect dharmic coherence above institutional power.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that false guidance causes misalignment in consciousness; thus, exclusion serves not as punishment but as restoration of epistemic clarity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how distorted teachings cascade into societal disorder. Responsibility is proportional to the reach and repetition of misleading acts. Non-punitive reality ensures separation without infliction of suffering.",

    "Initiate public consciousness education to recognize markers of false guides",
    "Implement ritual and cognitive distancing procedures for communities affected by such influences",
    "Restore integrity pathways through reconnection with authentic Vedic teachers",
    "Establish dharmic audit systems to prevent infiltration of institutions by spiritually deviant actors"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: False guides and corrupt influencers hold no place in Sanatana Dharma. Dharma is restored through conscious disassociation. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns as the ultimate judge."
