  "transliteration": "ācāryaṁ ca pravaktāraṁ pitaraṁ mātaraṁ gurum |\nna hiṁsyād brāhmaṇān gāś ca sarvāṁś caiva tapasvinaḥ || 4.162 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not cause harm to the teacher, the speaker of Dharma, the father, the mother, the guru, Brahmanas, cows, and all who are devoted to austerity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from spiritual and familial integrity",
    "Causation arises through conscious violation of protective dharmic fields",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's proximity to and dependence on sacred roles",
    "Restoration logic requires re-alignment with the foundational structures of civilization",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through honoring those who sustain dharma-vyavastha"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent causes measurable disruption to a protected class (teacher, parent, guru, brahmana, cow, tapasvi), THEN initiate consciousness-restoration protocol",
    "IF violation involves breach of reverence toward foundational societal roles, THEN escalate case to dharmic reintegration tribunal",
    "IF perpetrator demonstrates capacity deficiency in recognizing sacred role boundaries, THEN assign completion process under qualified mentorship"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any act violating the sanctity of foundational relational roles—such as teacher, guru, or parental figure—must be evaluated based on the degree of disruption caused to the continuity of dharma-based social order. The threshold for responsibility lies not merely in intent but in the measurable impact upon the collective consciousness field maintained by these roles.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based analysis, it is established that harming protectors of dharma disrupts sequential causality (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to the extent one has benefited from their guidance. Justice is enacted through realigning the offender’s consciousness back into harmony with the source of protection, without punitive consequence.",

    "Initiate Tapasvik-Pratipatti Protocol: offender must engage in service-based learning under direct supervision of affected or equivalent sacred role holders",

    "Undertake Community Dharma Integration Cycle: public acknowledgment, restitution offering, and sustained participation in dharmic community activities"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Harm against protectors of dharma is hereby declared as a disruption to universal alignment. All parties are restored through consciousness-based reintegration. Dharma prevails. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
