  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The artisan, the hunter, the stage-descender, the goldsmith, the weaver, and the seller of weapons—these persons are designated as inherently misaligned with Vedic Dharma due to their engagement in activities that distort consciousness and disrupt societal harmony.",

The court functions as a conduit for realigning errant agents back into dharmic coherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that distortion manifests sequentially through intent, choice, and action.
