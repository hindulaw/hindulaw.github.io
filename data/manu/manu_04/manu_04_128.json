  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A celibate shall remain pure in thought, word, and deed on new moon days, eighth lunar days, full moon days, and fourteenth lunar days; even after completing student life, a twice-born must maintain this discipline.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from sustained purity of conduct aligned with cosmic rhythm",
    "Causation is rooted in alignment with lunar cycles as markers of energetic purity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility increases with initiation into higher stages of life",
    "Restoration logic operates through consistent observance rather than episodic compliance",

Violations during these periods indicate temporary suspension of qualified authority until completion of restorative protocols.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consciousness manifests proportionally to restraint observed during energetically potent lunar phases. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates sequential unfolding of inner discipline. Responsibility arises from knowingly entering sacred timeframes without requisite preparation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms misalignment results in natural withdrawal of capacity, not imposed penalty.",

Dharma stands restored through conscious alignment with sacred temporal rhythms. Reality remains non-punitive when consciousness assumes its rightful role as adjudicator. All else follows accordingly."
