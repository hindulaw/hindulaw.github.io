  "transliteration": "edhau dakaṁ mūla-phalam annam abhudyataṁ ca yat |\nsarvataḥ pratigṛhṇīyān madhv athābhaya-dakṣiṇām ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must accept gifts of clarified butter, water, root crops, fruits, cooked food, and honey from those who have attained fearlessness through knowledge.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from realized consciousness, not material status",
    "Causation aligns with purity of intent and spiritual maturity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of donor's enlightened state",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes integration of sattvic abundance",
    "Consciousness alignment is facilitated through acceptance of spiritually purified offerings"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF donor exhibits fearlessness (abhaya) AND offering consists of specified pure substances THEN recipient MUST accept without refusal",
    "IF refusal occurs THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol for obstructed sattva flow",
    "IF recipient holds position of spiritual instruction THEN rejection constitutes breach of dharmic data exchange integrity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving disputes over guru-disciple relationships or spiritual endowments, the Court must evaluate the donor’s attainment of abhayam as a threshold criterion for validity of transaction. Refusal to receive from such donors indicates violation of Nyāya-adhikaraṇa alignment and demands corrective restoration rather than punitive action.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that fearlessness (abhayam) is the sole valid measure of donor eligibility. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that refusal disrupts sequential manifestation of sattvic nourishment. Responsibility lies in maintaining conscious receptivity; hence, correction involves reintegration into dharmic giving cycles without punitive attribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where refusal is publicly retracted and offering accepted",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol wherein refuser serves in nourishment distribution to reaffirm sattvic alignment",
    "Implement capacity restoration through supervised sattvic intake until vibrational harmony resumes",
    "Execute integrity reintegration via ceremonial acknowledgment of donor's abhayam status"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows directly from Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
