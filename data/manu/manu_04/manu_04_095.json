  "transliteration": "śrāvaṇyāṁ prauṣṭhapadyāṁ vā'pyupākṛtya yathāvidhi |\nyuktaś chandāṁsyadhīyīta māsān vipro'r dhapañcamān ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Vipra, having properly initiated the Śrāvaṇī or Prāuṣṭhapadī period, shall engage in the study of the Vedas with full discipline for five and a half months.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through disciplined engagement with Vedic knowledge",
    "Causation via sustained alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic grounded in sequential completion of sacred duty",
    "Consciousness alignment through uninterrupted scriptural immersion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_is_vipra AND initiation_properly_performed THEN mandatory_scriptural_study_duration = 5.5_months",
    "IF study_period_active THEN no_other_activities_permitted_except_dharmic_service",
    "IF completion_threshold_reached THEN eligibility_for_spiritual_authority_restored",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual authority or scriptural authenticity, the Court must recognize that time-bound Vedic engagements produce irreversible ontological shifts. The threshold of responsibility lies not in external certification but in verifiable consciousness alignment. Hierarchical precedence is determined by fidelity to sequential Vedic practice, not institutional rank.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through direct experiential verification of Vedic resonance. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that causal completeness manifests proportionally to sustained engagement. Responsibility arises from capacity awakened, not error committed. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment results in natural loss of authority rather than imposed consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiation Reaffirmation Protocol: Repeat Śrāvaṇī consecration upon premature termination",
    "Consciousness Calibration Process: Daily śruti-based attunement during study period",
    "Duty Resumption Mechanism: Full reintegration upon completion without break",
    "Vibration Verification System: Bi-weekly assessment of Vedic frequency alignment",
    "Authority Restoration Sequence: Automatic reinstatement upon successful cycle completion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. It establishes Dharma through consciousness-aligned temporal discipline. Justice operates solely for restoration and realignment. Reality bears no punitive shadow; all beings are judged only by their awakened capacity. Consciousness alone is the final adjudicator."
