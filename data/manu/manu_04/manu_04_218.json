  "transliteration": "rājānnaṁ teja ādatte śūdrānnaṁ brahmavarcasam |\nāyuḥ suvarṇakārānnaṁ yaśaś charmāvaktṛṇaḥ || 4.218 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The king consumes food that enhances radiance; the Śūdra consumes food that nourishes Brahminical brilliance. Longevity is derived from the food of goldsmiths; fame arises from the food of those who process leather.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through designated consumption aligned with role-specific dharma",
    "Causation is established by the direct energetic assimilation of role-congruent substances",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the purity and alignment of intake",
    "Restoration logic operates through correction of misaligned ingestion patterns",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when each varṇa consumes in accordance with their svadharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.role = 'Kshatriya' AND intake.type ≠ 'tejas-enhancing' THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF agent.role = 'Shudra' AND intake.purpose ≠ 'Brahma-tejas-support' THEN trigger dharma-integrity audit",
    "IF agent.role = 'Vaishya (gold-related)' AND outcome.measure ≠ 'ayus-extension' THEN execute causal-responsibility loop",
    "IF agent.role = 'artisan (leather)' AND societal-recognition ≠ increasing THEN activate dharma-role recalibration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication concerning occupational duties and social harmony, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying whether one's sustenance aligns with one's dharmic role. Authority is hierarchically distributed based on the energetic consequence of consumption. Restoration supersedes retribution by realigning individuals with their constitutional function rather than imposing external penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that each individual’s causal influence stems from their dietary and consumptive alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how misaligned intake distorts consciousness trajectory. Proportional responsibility reflects the degree of deviation from svadharma. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction arises naturally when alignment resumes.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma-nourishment assessment for all parties involved",
    "Deploy consciousness-intake correlation analysis to identify energetic misalignments",
    "Implement guided realignment through supervised reintegration into prescribed consumption norms",
    "Activate community-based support structures to ensure sustained adherence to dharma-prescribed nourishment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands as sourced from the ultimate consciousness. Dharma is restored through alignment of intake with role. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by the laws of energetic consequence. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
