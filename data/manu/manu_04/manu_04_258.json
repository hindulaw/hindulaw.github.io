  "transliteration": "ekākī cintayennityaṁ vivikte hitamātmanaḥ | hitamātmani ekākī cintayāno hi paraṁ śreyo'dhigacchati || 4.258 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must always deliberate in solitude for the welfare of the Self; one who reflects alone upon what benefits the Self attains the Supreme Good.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from inner realization, not external validation",
    "Causation arises through conscious reflection and alignment with the Self",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is realized through self-governance and solitude",
    "Restoration logic operates via reconnection to the Self",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate judicial criterion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual engages in daily solitary contemplation FOR the purpose of discerning personal dharma AND maintains integrity to that insight, THEN legal standing shall recognize such introspective authority as valid precedent",
    "IF a decision impacts another, THEN it must originate from a state of undisturbed internal clarity verified by sustained behavioral alignment",
    "IF conflict arises due to lack of self-knowledge, THEN enforcement protocol initiates guided reflective isolation until capacity for Self-aligned judgment is restored"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, deliberations concerning constitutional interpretation or national policy must be preceded by periods of seclusion wherein justices engage in contemplative analysis oriented toward the Self's highest good. Such judgments derive legitimacy only when demonstrably sourced from awakened consciousness rather than reactive consensus or political pressure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that right understanding emerges exclusively through inward-focused cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that misjudgment stems from fragmentation from the Self, not inherent defect. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies in returning to contemplative alignment. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that error dissolves naturally upon reconnection to the Self.",
