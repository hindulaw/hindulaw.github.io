  "transliteration": "ya ete'nye tvabhojyannāḥ kramaśaḥ parikīrtitāḥ | teṣāṃ tvagasthiromāṇi vadantyannaṃ manīṣiṇaḥ || 4.221||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those other foods, though unfit for consumption and sequentially enumerated as prohibited, are declared by wise discerners to be consumed in states of extreme necessity where skin, bones, and hair alone remain as testimony to survival.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from discriminative wisdom aligned with survival consciousness",
    "Causation arises from existential thresholds beyond which dharma adapts to preserve life",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by the integrity of consciousness under duress",
    "Restoration logic activates when foundational life-supporting structures are at risk",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of dharmic adaptability within absolute limits"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (survival_threshold_met == TRUE) AND (no_alternative_nourishment_available == TRUE) THEN (consumption_of_prohibited_food_permitted = TRUE)",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold jurisprudence wherein existential extremity overrides normative food restrictions. The court must assess not mere physical hunger but the imminent collapse of bodily integrity evidenced by witnessable signs—skin, bone, hair—as verified by qualified discerners. Authority lies in validating consciousness-preserving action over rigid adherence to dietary codes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through direct evidence of physiological decline. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential depletion leading to necessity. Proportional responsibility aligns with the immediacy of threat to consciousness continuity. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that preservation of sentient awareness supersedes ritualistic prohibition without moral fault accruing.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establishment of access to appropriate nourishment post-necessity",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment by community of failure to provide sustenance",
    "Capacity Restoration: Physical and spiritual rehabilitation of survivor post-extremity",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public validation of survival as dharmically justified act"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores balance through recognition of conscious necessity. No punishment accrues; only alignment with survival-consciousness prevails. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
