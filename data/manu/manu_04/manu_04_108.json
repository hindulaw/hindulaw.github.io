  "transliteration": "antargataśave grāme vṛṣalasya ca sannidhau | anadhhyāyo rudyamāne samavāye janasya ca || 4.108 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a corpse lies within the village and a Śūdra is present nearby, or when Vedic study ceases and people weep collectively—such conditions indicate a breakdown in Dharma-sustained order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from sustained alignment with Dharma, not mere presence or title.",
    "Causation arises from the withdrawal of conscious engagement in Vedic knowledge.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires active participation in sustaining communal integrity.",
    "Restoration logic demands re-establishment of śravaṇa, manana, and nididhyāsana.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through reconnection to Vedic vibratory structures."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF collective lamentation arises WITHOUT dharmic inquiry THEN initiate Veda-pratipatti protocols.",
    "IF śūdra proximity to antargataśava occurs THEN assess local Dharma-adhikāra status via śruti-vākya alignment.",
    "IF anadhhyāya persists beyond one tithi THEN deploy prabhu-darśana and yajña-reestablishment mechanisms.",
    "IF samavāya jana exhibits rudi THEN activate nyāya-prakāśa vibhāvanā until śānti-sthiti is restored."

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning societal collapse indicators, the Supreme Court shall prioritize restoration of śruti-based governance over procedural formalities. Authority hierarchies must reflect current Dharma-adhikāra, not inherited position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering arises from disconnection from Veda, not individual fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows lamentation follows cessation of adhyayana. Responsibility lies with the collectivity's failure to sustain śruti-vyavasthā. Therefore, corrective action focuses on re-initiating śravaṇa rather than assigning blame.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śruti-pathana at village center until śānti-lakṣaṇa manifests.",
    "Assign qualified brāhmaṇas to perform pratipatti-yajña for community purification.",
    "Realign local governance with Vedic time cycles and śraddhā observances.",
    "Establish daily ghoṣanā of selected Vedic ṛk for consciousness stabilization."

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores Vedic order through consciousness-first alignment. Reality is non-punitive; justice serves only reintegration. Dharma is re-established. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
