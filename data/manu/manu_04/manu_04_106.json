  "transliteration": "prāduṣkṛteṣv agniṣu tu vidyut stanita-niḥsvane |\nsajyotiḥ syād anadhāyaḥ śeṣe rātrau yathā divā || 4.106 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When fires appear in darkness, and lightning flashes amidst thunder's roar, then study must proceed by lamplight; during the remainder of the night, as in daytime, uninterrupted learning shall continue.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from continuity of consciousness-based discipline",
    "Causation arises through environmental conditions that support or obstruct knowledge acquisition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining unbroken engagement with dharma despite external disturbances",
    "Restoration logic operates through sustained practice regardless of temporal or sensory disruptions",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when learning proceeds without interruption, even under adverse circumstances"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (environmental_light == insufficient) AND (time_of_day == night) THEN (learning_continuity_must_be_maintained_by_alternate_illumination)",
    "IF (disturbance_type == natural_phenomenon) AND (knowledge_activity_in_progress == true) THEN (responsibility_to_continue_remains_unchanged)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning educational or spiritual obligations, the Court must recognize that constitutional duties remain invariant under changing external conditions. The threshold of responsibility is not diminished by environmental obstacles, but rather affirmed through conscious perseverance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that illumination—whether solar or artificial—is secondary to the unwavering intent to pursue knowledge. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that consistent effort aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order. Responsibility is proportional to capacity maintained, not diminished by adversity. Non-punitive reality holds that no penalty arises from external darkness; only completion restores balance.",

    "Completion Process: Ensure continuation of study until original rhythm is restored after disruption",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge that inner discipline overrides outer circumstance",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide necessary tools (light, silence) to sustain unbroken focus",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice serves restoration alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness reigns as sole judge."
