  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not accept objects without knowing their lawful and dharmic source; even when afflicted by hunger, the wise must act in accordance with discernment and dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from conscious discernment, not material need",
    "Causation originates in awareness, not circumstance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires knowledge of origin and purpose",
    "Restoration logic aligns acceptance with dharmic integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes material transaction"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF object_source IS unknown THEN action = reject",
    "IF dharmic_compliance IS false THEN transaction_permitted = no",
    "IF agent_hunger IS true AND discernment_active IS false THEN action = delay",
    "IF prajna_state IS active THEN pratigraha_permitted = conditional_on_dharma_check"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving receipt of goods or resources, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying dharmic compliance and lawful origin prior to acceptance. The court must ensure that material need does not override conscious discernment, and that all transactions uphold dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that acceptance without knowledge breaches dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that improper acceptance leads to misalignment.
