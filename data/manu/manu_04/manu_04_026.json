  "sph_interpretive_translation": "At the completion of the harvest season, the twice-born perform sacrifices with sacred rites; likewise at the close of each season, they offer oblations with animals and soma offerings at the equinoxes.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual timing is governed by cosmic rhythm, aligning individual action with universal order.",
    "Causation: Proper ritual observance ensures continuity of natural and social harmony.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those initiated in Vedic knowledge bear the duty to perform seasonal rituals.",
    "Restoration logic: Seasonal sacrifices maintain balance between human activity and divine rhythm.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Correct performance of yajña realigns individual consciousness with cosmic dharma."

Timing of such acts is determined by celestial cycles, which override judicial calendars unless proven to disrupt societal equilibrium.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that time-bound actions are causally linked to universal rhythms. Non-performance does not incur penalty but creates imbalance requiring sequential correction through conscious restoration. Responsibility flows from capacity, not coercion.",
