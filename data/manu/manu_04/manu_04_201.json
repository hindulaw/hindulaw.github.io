  "sanskrit_verse": "परकीयनिपानेषु न स्नायाधि कदा चन । स्नायाच्च कदा चन निपानकर्तुः स्नात्वा तु दुष्कृतांशेन लिप्यते ॥ ४.२०१॥",
  "transliteration": "parakīya-nipāneṣu na snāyādhi kadā cana | snāyāc ca kadā cana nipāna-kartuḥ snātvā tu duṣkṛtāṃśena lipyate || 4.201 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must never bathe in a well or water source belonging to another. Whoever bathes after the owner has bathed becomes沾染 with the impurity of the wrongdoer.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority over property extends to its ritual and physical use",
    "Causation arises through sequential participation in contaminated action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by conscious choice and awareness of ownership boundaries",
    "Restoration logic requires purification and re-alignment with rightful ownership consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment demands respect for proprietary integrity and energetic purity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent accesses resource_owned_by(another) AND resource_is_sacred_or_utilitarian(well, pond, water source) THEN access_prohibited = TRUE",
    "IF agent_bathes(after_owner_has_bathed(resource)) THEN liability_score += k_impurity_transfer_coefficient",
    "IF contamination_occurs THEN initiate_purification_protocol(owner, trespasser)",
    "IF ownership_boundary_violated THEN restore_integrity_through_acknowledgment_and_non_use_period(duration_defined_by_dharmic_order)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving unauthorized usage of sacred or utilitarian resources owned by individuals or communities, the threshold of responsibility lies in the intentional crossing of ownership-defined energetic boundaries. The court must recognize that such actions disturb not only material order but also ontological harmony. Remediation must precede litigation; punitive measures are invalid as they misalign with the Nyaya principle of causality rooted in consciousness rather than consequence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that contamination occurs via sequential engagement (anupūrvaśaḥ) — one who enters after the original user inherits residual karmic disturbance. This is neither moral judgment nor punishment, but ontic consequence. Proportional responsibility aligns with the level of conscious intent and energetic disruption caused. Therefore, restoration involves acknowledgment, purification, and refraining from repetition, ensuring no punitive frame distorts dharma's execution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein violator acknowledges breach of energetic boundary",
    "Perform śuddhi karma (purification ritual) under guidance of authorized dharmic administrator",
    "Establish temporary non-access period for both parties to realign consciousness with proprietorship laws",
    "Reintegrate violator into community only upon verified restoration of energetic cleanliness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through recognition of proprietorship, energetic hygiene, and consciousness-first justice. There is no punishment—only alignment. Reality responds to clarity, not coercion. Consciousness remains the ultimate judge."
