  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold of responsibility tied not to punitive frameworks but to ontological duties owed by individuals and institutions to the substrata of civilization—earth, sustenance, wisdom, and divinity. The court must ensure that violations are corrected through ceremonial realignment rather than punitive measures.",
