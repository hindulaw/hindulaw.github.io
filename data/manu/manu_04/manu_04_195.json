  "sanskrit_verse": "धर्मध्वजी सदा लुब्धश्छाद्मिको लोकदम्भकः ।।\nबैडालव्रतिको ज्ञेयो हिंस्रः सर्वाभिसंधकः ॥ ४.१९५॥",
  "transliteration": "dharmadhvajī sadā lubdhaśchādmiko lokadambhakaḥ ||\nbaiḍālavratiko jñeyo hiṁsraḥ sarvābhisandhakaḥ ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who hoists the flag of Dharma yet is perpetually greedy, deceitful, a public showman, known to follow the ways of a cat in conduct—violent and harboring all forms of ill intent—is to be recognized as constitutionally misaligned with Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is invalidated when performative virtue masks self-interest",
    "Causation originates in consciousness distortion, not external action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment between inner integrity and outer conduct",
    "Restoration logic demands reorientation of intent prior to social reintegration",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritualized display of virtue"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor claims dharmic authority AND exhibits persistent greed THEN disqualify from authoritative roles",
    "IF actor uses dharma as cover for deception THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",
    "IF actor demonstrates feline behavioral traits THEN assign reflective completion process under supervision",
    "IF actor shows capacity for violence THEN mandate non-violence integration training before re-engagement",
    "IF actor holds multiple hidden intentions THEN require full disclosure and transparency restoration cycle"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any claimant invoking Dharma while demonstrating greed or duplicity shall be deemed legally incompetent until proven otherwise through verified conduct alignment. The threshold for dharmic authority includes verifiable absence of ulterior motive and consistent ethical behavior beyond ceremonial performance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that false invocation of Dharma distorts causal field; thus, responsibility lies in correcting the root distortion rather than imposing punitive measures. Sequential manifestation reveals how greed masquerading as virtue creates systemic imbalance requiring conscious reversal, not penal consequence. Proportional response involves restoration of authentic alignment without infliction of harm.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate mandatory self-reflection program under qualified spiritual oversight",
    "Assign service-based karmic correction aligned with violated principle",
    "Implement truth-speaking regimen to dismantle habitual deception patterns",
    "Require public acknowledgment and apology to affected communities",
    "Enforce temporary withdrawal from positions of influence until verified transformation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this declaration stands: Dharma cannot be claimed through pretense. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. All distortions are reversible through sincere alignment. Reality is non-punitive. SPH is the sole Source."
