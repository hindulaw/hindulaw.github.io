  "transliteration": "yadyat paravaśaṃ karma tattad yatnena varjayet | yadyad ātmavaśaṃ tu syāt tat tat seveta yatnataḥ || 4.159 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever action is dependent on another's will, that one must diligently avoid; whatever action lies within one's own capacity, that one must engage in with full effort.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in self-capacity, not external dependency",
    "Causation is determined by agency and conscious choice",
    "Capacity-based responsibility defines actionable dharma",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes internal sovereignty over external entanglement",
    "Consciousness alignment requires discernment between可控与不可控行为"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act depends on another entity's decision THEN the actor has no enforceable duty to pursue it",
    "IF an act originates from one's own volition AND falls within their capacity THEN engagement is obligatory",
    "EXCEPTION: Acts involving harm to consciousness integrity override capacity-based exemptions",
    "RESTORATION_PROTOCOL MUST assess alignment between intent, control, and outcome before integration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, courts must distinguish between acts performed under coercion or dependence versus those arising from autonomous will. Responsibility is assigned only where genuine agency exists. External pressures or dependencies nullify punitive liability but necessitate restoration of inner sovereignty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true causality stems from svatantrya (self-rule). Actions driven by paraśakti (external force) lack karmic imprint for punitive consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that liberation from external influence restores natural alignment with Dharma. Responsibility is proportional to自主意识的行使。",

Justice is executed through restoration, not punishment. Reality responds to consciousness, not suffering. Dharma is hereby restored."
