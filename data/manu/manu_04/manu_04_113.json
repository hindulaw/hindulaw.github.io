  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In conditions of obscured visibility, upon hearing the sound of arrows, during both twilight periods, on the fourteenth lunar day of the waning moon, on the full moon day, and during the eightfold convergence of asterisms—action must align with heightened awareness and precise discernment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is context-sensitive and escalates with environmental uncertainty",
    "Causation arises from sensory perception aligned with cosmic rhythm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility increases with temporal and atmospheric instability",
    "Restoration logic demands synchronization with celestial order",
    "Consciousness alignment requires attunement to lunar and astral cycles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (visibility = 'low') AND (auditory_signal = 'weapon_sound') THEN (decision_latency := minimal)",
    "IF (time_of_day IN ['dawn_twilight', 'dusk_twilight']) THEN (authority_threshold := elevated)",
    "IF (lunar_phase IN ['waning_14th', 'full_moon', 'astral_convergence']) THEN (responsibility_coefficient := high)",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters arising under atmospheric or temporal duress, the Supreme Court must recognize that decision-making thresholds shift according to sensory clarity, time-bound spiritual rhythms, and auditory triggers. The court's authority must reflect a proportional rise in response readiness without attributing fault or negligence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that action under obscured conditions is not blameworthy but necessitates refined discernment. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that sequential manifestation of events under such conditions must be met with alignment rather than correction. Proportional responsibility reflects the expanded capacity required for conscious response. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misjudgment in altered states is a call for recalibration, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Sensory Calibration Protocol to restore perceptual clarity",
    "Apply Temporal Alignment Process to synchronize decision-making with natural cycles",
    "Engage Lunar Resonance Restoration to harmonize intent with astral influence",
    "Execute Auditory Signal Integration to refine reactive responsiveness",
    "Deploy Consciousness Stabilization Sequence to elevate discriminative awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of all Dharma. This law restores alignment between human action and cosmic rhythm. Justice flows through consciousness, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
