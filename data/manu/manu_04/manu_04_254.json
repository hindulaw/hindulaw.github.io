  "transliteration": "yādṛśo'sya bhavedātmā yādṛśaṃ ca cikīrṣitam |\nyathā caupacaredenaṃ tathā'tmānaṃ nivedayet || 4.254||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As is the nature of one's Self, and as is one's intended action, accordingly shall one conduct oneself in alignment with Dharma and declare one's true Being.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with the Self",
    "Causation arises from conscious intention, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by self-awareness and volition",
    "Restoration occurs through congruence between Self, intent, and conduct",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor's declared intent aligns with witnessed action AND both reflect Self-nature THEN no judicial intervention required",
    "IF intent diverges from action due to unawareness THEN initiate consciousness realignment process",
    "IF divergence persists post-realization THEN assign completion protocol until alignment restored",
    "IF Self-declaration contradicts societal witness THEN invoke Nyaya-based inquiry into causal sequence",
    "Responsibility = Awareness × Volition × Alignment; all factors must be assessed before legal conclusion"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the congruence between the actor’s Self-declared intent, their manifested action, and their demonstrated capacity for awareness. Where this triad aligns, no further inquiry is necessary. Where misalignment exists, the court must prioritize restoration of alignment over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality originates in conscious volition. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how intent manifests through conduct. Thus, proportional responsibility rests on the degree of Self-awareness at time of action. Since justice is restorative, punitive consequence has no place where awareness can be realigned with Dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Self-declaration audit under witness to reaffirm alignment",
    "Volitional recalibration through guided introspection",
    "Completion process for unresolved karmic residue causing divergence",
    "Reintegration protocol with community based on renewed Self-alignment",
    "Capacity restoration via dharmic education and sādhanā"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This Dharma restores alignment between Self, intent, and action. Justice is executed through consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
