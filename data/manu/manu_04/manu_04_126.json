  "transliteration": "paśumaṇḍūkamārjāraśvasarpanakulākhubhiḥ | antarāgamane vidyādanadhayāmaharniśam || 4.126||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who enters among cattle, frogs, cats, dogs, snakes, mongooses, or similar creatures without restraint shall be deemed perpetually engaged in non-study day and night.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious discrimination between higher and lower states of existence.",
    "Causation arises through unregulated proximity to diminished consciousness forms.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the ability to maintain Vedic discipline amidst environmental contamination.",
    "Restoration logic requires withdrawal from degrading influences to recover sacred learning capacity.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands separation from entities that disrupt the rhythm of sustained study."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent enters unrestricted contact zone with designated low-vibration fauna THEN assign continuous non-study status until purification protocol completion.",
    "IF entity demonstrates repeated failure to avoid contaminant zones THEN initiate mandatory seclusion and recitation restoration cycle.",
    "IF individual shows pattern of regression during learning THEN enforce boundary maintenance algorithm with real-time alert system.",
    "IF consciousness drift detected via behavioral metrics THEN deploy immediate dissociation sequence from identified disruptive agents."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes a threshold where habitual disregard for spiritual boundaries constitutes a forfeiture of scholarly standing. The court must recognize such behavior as a systemic threat to knowledge preservation, necessitating structured reintegration rather than punitive exclusion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that immersion in environments conducive to lowered awareness directly obstructs cognitive refinement. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how repeated exposure leads to irreversible decline in dharmic perception. Thus, proportional responsibility lies not in blame but in enforced detachment and recalibration. This reflects the non-punitive reality rule wherein action naturally incurs its own consequence within the field of consciousness itself.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vācaka Śuddhi Process: isolate subject from all listed fauna zones for minimum 21 days while conducting daily mantra immersion.",
    "Deploy Antara-Dṛṣṭi Correction Cycle: utilize guided visualization techniques to restore mental clarity lost due to degraded sensory engagement.",
    "Implement Sādhanā Dhārā Reconnection Protocol: reintroduce disciplined routines under supervision to rebuild capacity for uninterrupted śravaṇa/smaraṇa.",
    "Activate Jñāna-Rakṣa Monitoring System: install automated alerts when proximity thresholds to restricted zones are breached."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established. Dharma is restored through recognition of consciousness-contaminating environments and their automatic disqualification from legitimate Vedic participation. Reality remains non-punitive; consequences emerge organically from misalignment with elevated vibratory fields. Consciousness alone serves as the ultimate adjudicator, reflecting truth without imposition."
