  "transliteration": "pratyagniṃ pratisūryaṃ ca pratisomodakadvijam | pratigu prativātaṃ ca prajñā naśyati mehataḥ || 4.52||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When consciousness turns outward toward fire, sun, soma, water, Brahmin, cow, wind, and other external objects, discernment perishes due to excessive dissipation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in internalized consciousness, not external forms",
    "Causation arises from misalignment with inner witness-state",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by withdrawal from sensory dispersion",
    "Restoration logic requires re-centering awareness within Self",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through cessation of object-oriented cognition"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF subject exhibits habitual orientation toward external validations THEN initiate sensory withdrawal protocol",
    "IF cognitive discernment is impaired due to environmental fixation THEN deploy consciousness-realignment sequence",
    "IF individual demonstrates persistent loss of discriminative faculty THEN assign restorative introspection mandate",
    "IF societal disruption originates from sensory indulgence THEN enforce collective stillness directives"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving diminished judgment or impaired discernment, the Supreme Court shall assess whether the root cause stems from outward projection of awareness. Where such projections have led to civil or ethical failure, the remedy lies not in punitive measures but in structured realignment protocols that restore inward-focused cognition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true knowledge arises only when consciousness withdraws from external dependencies. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of impaired judgment follows predictable patterns of sensory indulgence. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the degree of withdrawal from inner witnessing. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction flows naturally upon reconnection with pure cognition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate daily silent sitting practice until baseline discernment returns",
    "Assign temporary detachment from all previously fixated external stimuli",
    "Implement guided withdrawal techniques under qualified spiritual supervision",
    "Establish completion process ensuring no residual identification remains with dispersed states"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. Consciousness, once restored to its innate stillness, naturally dissolves error without recourse to punishment. Justice is fulfilled through alignment with the Self. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
