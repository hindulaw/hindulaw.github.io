  "transliteration": "yat karma kurvato'sya syāt paritoṣo'ntarātmanaḥ | tat prayatnena kurvīta viparītaṃ tu varjayet || 4.161||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever action yields inner satisfaction to the doer, that should be performed with effort; the opposite, however, must be abandoned.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with内在意识满足 (inner conscious satisfaction)",
    "Causation is determined by the内在完整性 (internal integrity) of the act",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from self-aware recognition of内在满足之果 (the fruit of inner satisfaction)",
    "Restoration logic operates through reinforcing actions aligned with内在喜悦 (inner joy)",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate judicial criterion for lawful behavior"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action generates内在满足 (inner satisfaction) AND effort is applied → THEN execute action",
    "IF action causes内在不安 (inner unrest) OR dissonance → THEN abandon action automatically",
    "WHEN individual performs action aligned with内在真理 (inner truth) → INCREASE capacity score in consciousness registry",
    "WHEN action contradicts内在和谐 (inner harmony) → TRIGGER restorative completion protocol"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must evaluate whether a ruling aligns with the内在满足原则 (principle of inner satisfaction). Legal decisions must not contradict the natural integrity of consciousness. The threshold of responsibility lies in the_actor's alignment with内在喜悦 (inner joy), not external coercion or precedent alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that actions rooted in内在满足 (inner satisfaction) inherently uphold Dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through sequential alignment of thought, intent, and action with内在完整性 (inner completeness). Responsibility is proportional to one's capacity for self-aware alignment. There is no punitive consequence—only realignment toward内在真理 (inner truth).",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Guide actor to revisit incomplete or misaligned actions until内在满足 (inner satisfaction) is restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Facilitate full ownership of action through guided introspection and energetic clearing",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reconnect actor with内在力量 (inner power) through meditative alignment practices",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Use vibrational resonance techniques to restore coherence between mind, body, and soul"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Law. Dharma is restored through alignment with内在满足 (inner satisfaction). Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
