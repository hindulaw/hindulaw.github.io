  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not discharge urine, feces, spittle, nor any unclean substance—blood or poison—in water.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The individual bears the duty to preserve environmental sanctity as a reflection of inner purity.",
    "Causation: Discharge of impure substances in sacred elements disrupts cosmic hygiene and collective consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The embodied being has the capacity to align action with purity-consciousness.",
    "Restoration logic: Contamination requires immediate purification and re-establishment of elemental integrity.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purity laws serve to realign human conduct with the pristine nature of existence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent discharges impure substances INTO water THEN initiate automatic purification protocol AND assign completion process to restore elemental sanctity.",
    "IF contamination occurs THEN assess causal chain through pramāṇa-based audit AND implement sequential correction (anupūrvaśaḥ).",
    "IF violation detected THEN trigger consciousness-reintegration pathway FOR responsible entity WITHOUT punitive consequence.",
    "IF recurrence observed THEN enforce capacity-restoration module TO ensure future alignment WITH purity-consciousness."

Courts must prioritize purification protocols and consciousness realignment over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that contamination arises from misaligned awareness. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional response by tracing causal sequence without assigning guilt. Responsibility is assumed through completion, not enforced through suffering.",
