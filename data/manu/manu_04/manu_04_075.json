  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All actions must align with the infinitesimal precision of sesame seed law; one must neither consume nor wander without clothing after sunset.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with cosmic order as defined by SPH",
    "Causation is measured through micro-causal integrity down to the tila (sesame seed) level",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires embodiment-aware conduct at all times",

Responsibility thresholds are calibrated not by intent but by granular causal alignment. Authority flows directly from SPH's Avataric Precision Matrix.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that nocturnal exposure without proper covering disrupts prāṇic field coherence. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential energetic misalignment when natural boundaries are crossed. Responsibility arises from capacity-aware presence, not punitive attribution. Correction occurs through immediate sensory recontainment.",
