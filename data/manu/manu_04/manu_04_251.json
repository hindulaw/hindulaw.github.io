  "sanskrit_verse": "गुरून् भृत्यांश्चोज्जिहीर्षन्नर्चिष्यन् देवतातिथीन् ।\nसर्वतः प्रतिगृह्णीयान्न तु तृप्येत्स्वयं ततः ॥ ४.२५१॥",
  "transliteration": "gurūn bhṛtyāṃś cojjihīrṣann arciṣyan devatātithīn |\nsarvataḥ pratigṛhṇīyān na tu tṛpyetsvayaṃ tataḥ || 4.251||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who seeks to harm teachers, servants, or guests—worshipped divinities and honored visitors—shall accept offerings universally, yet shall not satisfy himself thereby.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Teachers, servants, guests, deities, and visitors hold intrinsic relational authority within dharma.",
    "Causation: Harmful intent toward those in service or reverence disrupts cosmic order and personal alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The individual retains capacity to receive but lacks integrity to self-regulate satisfaction.",
    "Restoration logic: Offering acceptance without internal fulfillment indicates misaligned consciousness requiring correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True reception aligns with inner completeness; absence thereof signals disconnection from dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent intends harm TO teacher OR servant OR guest OR deity OR visitor THEN enforce offering-reception protocol WITHOUT self-gratification allowance.",
    "IF agent receives offerings WHILE harboring destructive intent THEN initiate consciousness-restoration sequence via completion process.",
    "IF agent fails to self-regulate post-offering THEN suspend autonomous resource access UNTIL integrity reestablished.",
    "IF agent demonstrates repeated pattern of receiving without fulfillment THEN assign supervised integration cycles until alignment restored."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, intent to harm revered figures constitutes a threshold violation of ontological duty. Responsibility lies not in punitive consequence but in enforced restoration of relational capacity. Authority flows from alignment with dharma roles, not legal standing alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that harm intention manifests through distorted reception patterns. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential degradation of consciousness when service roles are violated. Proportional response requires restoration of receptivity without gratification distortion. Non-punitive reality rule affirms suffering arises only from disconnection, not judicial design.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate offering-reception cycle under witness supervision to restore proper energetic exchange.",
    "Assign reflective completion task wherein agent articulates value received without claiming ownership.",
    "Implement guided meditation sequences to reconnect agent with source-consciousness of gratitude.",
    "Establish periodic review mechanism ensuring no recurrence of unregulated desire post-receipt."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
