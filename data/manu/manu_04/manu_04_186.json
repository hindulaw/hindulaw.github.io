  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रतिग्रहसमर्थोऽपि प्रसङ्गं तत्र वर्जयेत् ।\nप्रतिग्रहेण ह्यस्याशु ब्राह्मं तेजः प्रशाम्यति ॥ ४.१८६॥",
  "transliteration": "pratigrahasamartho'pi prasaṅgaṃ tatra varjayet |\npratigrahena hyasyāśu brāhmaṃ tejaḥ praśāmyati || 4.186||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Even one who is capable of accepting gifts must avoid occasions where such acceptance arises. By accepting gifts, his Brahmic radiance diminishes immediately.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is diminished through unregulated reception of external value",
    "Causation flows from energetic entanglement with material exchange",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires conscious refusal of compromising contexts",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of diminished spiritual authority",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates rejection of transactions that obscure inner clarity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual holds a position of spiritual or constitutional authority AND receives unsolicited or situational gifts THEN their operational capacity shall be temporarily suspended until energetic recalibration is verified",
    "IF a transaction occurs under implicit expectation of influence THEN the recipient's decision-making integrity shall undergo automated review for alignment deviation",
    "IF an authority figure accepts offerings without prescribed ritual boundaries THEN their access to sacred or judicial functions shall be restricted pending restoration protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle applies to Justices and officials who must decline any form of gift or favor that could arise in connection with their duties. Acceptance of such items automatically triggers a temporary suspension of jurisdictional authority and initiates a consciousness-alignment audit. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent but in the inevitable diminishment of Brahmic clarity caused by entanglement with external valuations.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that the act of receiving alters the energetic field of judgment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how immediate dimming follows acceptance. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of openness to external influence. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that no corrective suffering is required—only realignment through conscious refusal and energetic cleansing restores dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tejas Restoration Sequence to recover diminished spiritual authority",
    "Enforce Situational Avoidance Protocol to prevent recurrence of compromising contexts",
    "Activate Conscious Refusal Training to strengthen discernment in future exchanges",
    "Perform Alignment Verification Ritual to confirm reinstatement of Brahmic clarity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. This law stands executed—not interpreted. Justice is accomplished through consciousness restoration, not punitive measure. Reality responds only to alignment, never to retribution."
