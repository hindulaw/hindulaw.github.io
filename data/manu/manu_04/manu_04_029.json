  "transliteration": "āsanāśanaśayyābhiradbhirmūlaphalena vā | nāsya kaścidvasedgehe śaktito'narcito'tithiḥ || 4.29||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "No guest, however unworthy or uninvited, shall be denied shelter, seat, food, or rest within a dwelling, if the dweller possesses the capacity to provide it.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from capacity, not status.",
    "Causation is rooted in conscious choice and resource availability.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates provision without evaluative judgment.",
    "Restoration logic centers on aligning individual action with universal hospitality.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires honoring the divine presence in all beings."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (dwelling_owner.capacity ≥ required_provision) AND (guest.requires_shelter OR guest.requires_sustenance) THEN (provision_of_āsana OR aśana OR śayyā OR mūla-phala IS MANDATORY).",
    "IF (individual.has_capacity = TRUE) THEN (denial_of_basic_hospitality IS VIOLATION_OF_DHARMA).",
    "IF (act_of_refusal_occurs) THEN (initiate_restorative_completion_process FOR dwelling_owner)."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, refusal to offer basic hospitality by one possessing the means constitutes a breach of dharma. The court must assess not intent but capacity and actual deprivation caused. Remediation focuses on restoration of the violated dharma through completion protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that refusal stems from misalignment of consciousness, not inherent vice. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential disconnection from svadharma leading to such neglect. Proportional responsibility lies in reestablishing alignment. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering is not justice; completion is.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Atithi-Yajna Completion Process for the household to restore dharmic alignment.",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol wherein the host engages in acts of conscious hospitality until alignment is restored.",
    "Facilitate consciousness reintegration via supervised service to guests for a defined period.",
    "Implement capacity affirmation review to ensure future compliance through awareness elevation."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through restoration of consciousness and alignment with the eternal law of hospitality. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
