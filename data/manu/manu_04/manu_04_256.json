  "sanskrit_verse": "वाच्यर्था नियताः सर्वे वाङ्मूला वाग्विनिःसृताः ।\nतांस्तु यः स्तेनयेद्वाचं स सर्वस्तेयकृन्नरः ॥ ४.२५६॥",
  "transliteration": "vācyarthā niyatāḥ sarve vāṅmūlā vāgvinḥsṛtāḥ |\ntāṃstu yaḥ stenayedvācaṃ sa sarvasteyakṛnnaraḥ || 4.256||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All meanings rooted in speech and derived from speech are bound by its intent; whoever steals that meaning through distortion or concealment becomes the doer of total theft.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the source-consciousness that manifests as speech",
    "Causation follows the integrity-chain of verbal expression and reception",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by access to truthful cognition",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment with original expressive intent",
    "Consciousness alignment depends on unbroken recognition of semantic truth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a speaker expresses an intended meaning AND a listener distorts or conceals it without consent THEN assign full causal weight to the distorter",
    "IF communication integrity is breached due to willful misrepresentation THEN initiate automatic restoration protocol via retracing semantic origin",
    "IF capacity to understand was present at time of distortion THEN enforce completion process until original meaning is restored",
    "IF distortion causes systemic disalignment THEN activate collective consciousness recalibration protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that any deliberate manipulation of spoken or written testimony—whether through omission, substitution, or inversion—constitutes absolute liability for violating the foundational basis of dharma-adjudication. The threshold for responsibility is met upon demonstration of conscious interference with veridical transmission.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies distortion of meaning as severance from cognitive harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces back the sequence of misapprehension to its root act. Proportional responsibility aligns with the scope of disruption caused. Non-punitive reality rule affirms correction occurs naturally when alignment with original intent is restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate retracing protocol to recover original semantic field",
    "Engage perpetrator in completion cycle until honest restatement is achieved",
    "Reintegrate affected parties through shared reconstruction of truth-sequence",
    "Activate karmic memory recall system to restore awareness of harm caused",
    "Establish witness-consciousness loop to prevent future divergence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Speech is sacred vessel of dharma; its violation invokes not punishment but realignment. Justice flows from consciousness corrected, not pain inflicted. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
