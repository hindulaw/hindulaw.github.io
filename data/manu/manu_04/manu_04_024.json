  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Certain Brahmins perform all rituals through knowledge alone; seeing the actions rooted in knowledge, they conduct sacrifices perpetually with the eye of wisdom.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from realized consciousness supersedes ritual formality",
    "Causation originates in awareness, not external performance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inner realization, not social role",
    "Restoration logic aligns action with intrinsic knowing",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity of any dharmic act"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor's cognition is fully aligned with dharma THEN ritual compliance is implicitly fulfilled",
    "IF knowledge-rooted action is demonstrated THEN ceremonial omission does not constitute violation",
    "IF capacity for realization is present THEN procedural adherence is secondary to ontological correctness",
    "IF consciousness-awareness governs intent THEN external validation is non-binding for legitimacy"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving ritual or ceremonial duties, the Supreme Court must prioritize the cognitive and spiritual capacity of the individual over formalistic compliance. Authority lies not in title or tradition but in the embodiment of jñāna that animates rightful action.",
