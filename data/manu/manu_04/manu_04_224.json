  "sanskrit_verse": "श्रोत्रियस्य कदर्यस्य वदान्यस्य च वार्धुषेः ।\nमीमांसित्वोभयं देवाः सममन्नमकल्पयन् ॥ ४.२२४॥",
  "transliteration": "śrotriyaḥ kadaryaḥ vadataḥ ca vārdhuṣeḥ | mīmāṁsitvobhayaṁ devāḥ samam annam akalpayan ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The learned yet miserly, the eloquent yet deceitful—both are equally unworthy of sustenance when their knowledge lacks integrity and their speech lacks truth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority without alignment with Dharma is nullified",
    "Causation arises from the purity of intent, not the volume of speech",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands congruence between knowing and being",
    "Restoration logic requires withdrawal of support from those who misuse sacred capacity",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes ritual or intellectual performance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual possesses śrotra-jñāna OR vāk-pratibhā AND exhibits kārpanya OR vārdhūṣyam THEN eligibility for societal sustenance SHALL BE REVOKED",
    "IF speech or learning is used to deceive OR exploit THEN all conferred privileges MUST BE AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDED pending realignment",
    "IF a person's conduct contradicts their declared dharma THEN no institutional support shall validate their status"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that neither scholarly reputation nor rhetorical skill confers immunity when intent is misaligned with Dharma. Responsibility thresholds are determined by the harmony between knowledge and action, not by position or title.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that contradiction between inner state and outer expression creates disorder. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that such dissonance manifests as systemic decay. Responsibility is proportional to the misuse of sacred capacity. This law does not punish; it withdraws misplaced validation to restore natural order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi Kriyā to purify the field of distorted knowledge",
    "Revoke access to platforms where deceit masquerades as wisdom",
    "Assign supervised service in alignment with truth until integrity is demonstrably restored",
    "Engage Vāk Yoga protocols to realign speech with consciousness",
    "Implement Samyama-based observation to verify internal coherence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of this Dharma. Misuse of sacred knowledge or speech results in automatic withdrawal of sustenance—not as punishment, but as restoration. Reality aligns only with Truth. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
