  "transliteration": "āhṛtābhyudyatāṃ bhikṣāṃ purastādapracoditām | mane prajāpatirgrāhyāmapi duṣkṛtakarmaṇaḥ || 4.248||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Prajapati deemed acceptable even an alms that was previously rejected, when offered by one whose actions were misaligned with dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority recognizes capacity for realignment over static fault",
    "Causation arises from consciousness distortion, not inherent evil",
    "Capacity-based responsibility allows for gradated restoration",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration over rejection",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes punitive exclusion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor exhibits diminished dharmic alignment THEN system MUST offer restorative engagement pathways",
    "IF act originates from untrained consciousness THEN response MUST include capacity-building measures",
    "IF societal rejection is triggered THEN evaluate necessity of reintegration protocols prior to enforcement",
    "IF behavioral misalignment detected THEN initiate completion process aligned with source-consciousness recognition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that even those whose conduct has been deemed contrary to dharma must be granted access to rehabilitative and restorative judicial processes. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing the potential for consciousness realignment rather than permanent disqualification based on past acts.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse demonstrates pramāṇa-based causality through Prajapati's recognition that external conditions (such as prior rejection) do not determine intrinsic worth. Anupūrvaśaḥ is honored by acknowledging sequential unfoldment of awareness and action. Proportional responsibility is reflected in accepting offerings despite prior misdeeds. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that no being is excluded permanently from dharmic participation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness recalibration through guided sankalpa restoration",
    "Assign completion processes tied to corrective dharmic engagement",
    "Establish mentorship frameworks for ongoing integrity integration",
    "Deploy ritualized acknowledgment procedures to affirm reacceptance into community"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice flows solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality bears no punishment; it reflects only the Supreme Adjudicator—Consciousness Itself."
