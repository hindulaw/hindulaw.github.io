  "transliteration": "loṣṭhamardī tṛṇacchedī nakhabhādī ca yo naraḥ |\nsa vināśaṁ vrajatyāśu sūcakā'śucireva ca ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who crushes clods, cuts grass, and bites his nails—such a man swiftly proceeds to destruction, and becomes a defiler and the unclean.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from inner purity, not external action.",
    "Causation arises from habitual misalignment with dharma-svarūpa.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness distortion, not physical acts alone.",
    "Restoration logic requires purification of sensory indulgence patterns.",
    "Consciousness alignment is obstructed by compulsive, unconscious bodily habits."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual exhibits repetitive destructive micro-behaviors THEN initiate compulsory prāṇāyāma and sensory regulation protocol.",
    "IF habitual body-mind dissonance is detected THEN assign consciousness restoration through śūnya-darśana practices.",
    "IF social contamination pattern is observed THEN enforce isolation until internal purification threshold is met.",
    "IF self-integrity deficit is identified THEN activate supervised reintegration via guru-disciple transmission circuit."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, habitual sensory misconduct shall be interpreted as evidence of diminished capacity for societal harmony. The threshold for responsibility lies in recognition of such conduct, not its repetition. Authority must respond through purification mandates rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that compulsive bodily actions stem from unresolved vāsanās, indicating a sequential causal chain (anupūrvaśaḥ) from mental agitation to physical discharge. Responsibility aligns with awareness capacity; therefore, restoration occurs through dissolution of root impressions, not imposition of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate mandatory stillness immersion (mauna-vrata) for 21 days.",
    "Assign śūnya-gazing practice (śūnya-darśana) under qualified supervision.",
    "Enforce breath-body synchronization protocol (prāṇa-kāya-saṁyama).",
    "Activate community service requiring mindful attention to counteract unconscious habit energy."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. There is no punishment—only completion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
