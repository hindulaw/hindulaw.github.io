  "transliteration": "na sasattveṣu garteṣu na gacchann api na sthitaḥ |\nna nadītīram āsādya na ca parvatam astake || 4.47 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who does not reside in sewers among living beings, nor remains stationary even while moving, neither approaches riverbanks nor dwells atop mountains—such a being transcends spatial and locational conditioning.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from transcendence of locational and environmental determinism",
    "Causation is unbound by physical placement or geographic attribution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from conscious mobility, not static positioning",
    "Restoration logic operates through detachment from locational identity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires non-attachment to terrain, habitat, or geography"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_location IN [sewer, riverbank, mountaintop] AND intent_to_reside = TRUE THEN dharma_compliance = FALSE",
    "IF motion_state = 'moving' AND positional_stability = 'false' THEN jurisdictional_binding = NULL",
    "IF entity_type = 'conscious_agent' AND location_attachment_level < threshold THEN legal_accountability_basis = 'transcendent'",
    "IF geographical_fixation_score > 0.7 THEN capacity_for_dharma_execution = reduced",
    "IF spatial_detachment_metric >= 0.9 THEN restorative_potential = high"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving territorial disputes or jurisdictional claims, the Supreme Court shall recognize that true authority stems from consciousness unconditioned by place. Legal persons demonstrating complete spatial detachment are inherently beyond conventional jurisdiction and must be adjudicated solely on the basis of volitional causality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that no fault inheres in absence of locational fixation; anupūrvaśaḥ reveals action unfolds independent of site-bound causality; proportional responsibility lies with those bound to space, not with the unattached; non-punitive reality rule confirms no corrective suffering is required where no binding exists.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Acknowledge all prior spatial attachments as dissolved upon attaining mobility",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Reclaim agency over movement without attributing blame to environment",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinforce inner dynamism to overcome gravitational or locational pull",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Align personal trajectory with cosmic flow rather than fixed coordinates"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed: Justice is not bound by place, truth moves freely, and consciousness alone adjudicates. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
