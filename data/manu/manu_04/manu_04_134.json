  "transliteration": "na hīdṛśamanāyuṣyaṃ loke kiṃ cana vidyate |\nyādṛśaṃ puruṣasyeha paradāropasevanam || 4.134||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "There exists no act in this world that diminishes life-force more than the violation of another's conjugal bond.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic integrity",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness distortion",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of violated dharma-tattva",
    "Consciousness alignment restores natural law when disrupted"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual engages in violation of another’s marital sanctity THEN initiate immediate cessation protocol AND activate consciousness-realignment sequence",
    "IF life-force depletion is detected due to relational transgression THEN deploy restorative resonance field until equilibrium restored",
    "IF capacity for dharma-adherence is impaired THEN assign guided reintegration process under qualified supervision",
    "IF societal harmony disruption occurs THEN execute systemic purification procedures aligned with Nyaya-based causality mapping"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, threshold of responsibility arises upon measurable disturbance in relational dharmic field. Authority lies not in punitive judgment but in calibrated restoration of energetic coherence. Hierarchy recognizes primacy of consciousness over conduct; hence, corrective measures precede structural interventions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal link between violation of paradaara and depletion of life-force. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential distortion in consciousness-field. Proportional response aligns with restoration of violated tattva without infliction of suffering. Non-punitive reality rule affirms correction through completion rather than condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate cessation of harmful pattern through vibrational realignment techniques",
    "Assign completion process involving acknowledgment, restitution, and conscious reaffirmation of sacred boundaries",
    "Deploy resonance healing to restore disrupted relational energy fields",
    "Implement supervised integration period to rebuild trust and clarity within affected community structures"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned action. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
