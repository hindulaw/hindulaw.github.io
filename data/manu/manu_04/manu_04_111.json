  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As long as the scent and residue of past false identification remain in the body of a learned Brahmin who has realized the Self, that Brahmin should not declare Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is conditional upon inner purification and ontological clarity.",
    "Causation is traced to subtle impressions (samskaras) that distort realization.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires readiness rooted in embodied purity.",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of residual falsity before declaration of truth.",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes authoritative utterance."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_residual_false_identification THEN agent.is_unqualified_to_declare_brahman",
    "IF agent.is_learned AND agent.is_embodied THEN agent.must_purify_samskaras_before_authority_activation",
    "IF agent.declares_brahman BEFORE purification THEN declaration.is_void AND restoration.protocol.initiate"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, declarations or rulings made by individuals whose consciousness remains clouded by past conditioning are to be deemed invalid until verified through purification protocols. The threshold of responsibility includes ontological fitness, not merely intellectual qualification.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies residual samskaras as impediments to true declaration. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that premature utterance arises from incomplete purification. Responsibility aligns with capacity to sustain Brahmic consciousness. No punitive action is required; restoration occurs through purification completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate samskara-dissolution process for the individual",
    "Assign consciousness-monitoring protocol until purity threshold met",
    "Revoke declaratory authority until integrity is restored",
    "Reintegrate individual upon completion without stigma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored. Truth is declared only when consciousness is purified. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
