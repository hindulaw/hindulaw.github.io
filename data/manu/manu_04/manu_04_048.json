  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who observes wind, fire, sun, water, cattle, and excrement—should never discharge urine or feces in any circumstance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The individual's capacity to maintain purity determines lawful action.",
    "Causation: Discharge of waste in inappropriate contexts disrupts cosmic order (Ṛta).",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Observers of elemental and biological realities bear a duty to align actions accordingly.",
    "Restoration logic: Purity-preserving conduct restores natural harmony.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Proper elimination reflects internal cleanliness and spiritual discipline."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF observer perceives elements OR biological matter THEN prohibit defecation/urination UNTIL appropriate containment is ensured.",
    "IF environment contains visible life, sacred symbols, or elemental representations THEN DO NOT release bodily waste.",
    "IF consciousness level of actor < threshold of awareness of elemental sanctity THEN trigger restorative completion protocol."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals with heightened perception bear greater responsibility for maintaining purity. Legal thresholds must evaluate not just external acts but the observer’s conscious recognition of sacred presence. Retribution has no place; only restoration of alignment with universal sanctity is admissible.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that improper discharge arises from failure to recognize surrounding divinity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misalignment begins internally before manifesting externally. Responsibility is proportional to sensory and cognitive engagement with the sacred. There is no punitive consequence—only a requirement for purification and renewed alignment.",

    "Completion Process: Individual must perform ritual cleansing and reaffirm commitment to elemental respect.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of disruption caused and voluntary undertaking of corrective observances.",

    "Integrity Reintegration: Community witnessing and affirmation of restored behavioral alignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned conduct. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
