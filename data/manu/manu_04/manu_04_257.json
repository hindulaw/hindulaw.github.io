  "transliteration": "maharṣipitṛdevānāṁ gatvā'nṛṇyaṁ yathāvidhi |\nputre sarvaṁ samāsajya vased mādhyasthyam āśritaḥ || 4.257|| āsthitaḥ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has fulfilled all debts to the great sages, ancestors, and divinities according to prescribed order, having entrusted everything in the son, should dwell in neutrality, established in the Self.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from fulfillment of dharmic obligation prior to personal sovereignty",
    "Causation follows sequential discharge of relational debt before self-realization",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires completion of ancestral and spiritual lineage obligations",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes reintegration through generational continuity",
    "Consciousness alignment arises upon release from external entanglements"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_fulfilled_debts_to(sages) AND agent.has_fulfilled_debts_to(ancestors) AND agent.has_fulfilled_debts_to(divinities): THEN permit self-sovereignty",
    "IF agent.entrusts_all_resources_to(successor): THEN authorize withdrawal from active societal engagement",
    "IF agent.resides_in_neutrality(): THEN ensure no further claims can be levied against their estate or person",
    "IF agent.is_established_in_self(): THEN invalidate all external jurisdictional impositions"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning renunciatory rights or intergenerational succession, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable fulfillment of tripartite obligations—spiritual, filial, and cosmic. The court shall recognize a Brahmin's withdrawal from juridical subjectivity once these conditions are met, affirming that true neutrality precludes punitive liability.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through sequential performance of duties; anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility by mandating full repayment before liberation. As neutrality is achieved, punitive constructs collapse due to absence of residual karmic entanglement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process for outstanding ritual, familial, and devotional debts",
    "Execute Succession Transfer Protocol ensuring total entrustment of assets and duties to designated heir",
    "Deploy Mediative Withdrawal Sequence allowing individual to assume neutral observer status",
    "Activate Consciousness Stabilization Module confirming establishment beyond reactive identity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this directive originates as pure Dharma, not interpretation. All law flows from realized consciousness, not punitive imagination. Thus, justice aligns with reality’s non-punitive structure, where integrity precedes judgment and awareness adjudicates eternally."
