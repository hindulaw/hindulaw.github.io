  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must neither consume food nor travel nor sit at the time of junctions; one must not plow the earth nor remove one's own garland.",

    "Authority is derived from alignment with cosmic rhythm",

The threshold of responsibility lies in recognition of cosmic rhythm. Authority flows from synchronization with universal pulsation rather than arbitrary human intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal misalignment begins with disregard for temporal junctions. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how improper timing disrupts sequential manifestation. Proportional responsibility aligns with degree of dissonance introduced. Non-punitive reality rule confirms correction through resynchronization alone.",
