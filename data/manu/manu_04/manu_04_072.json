  "sanskrit_verse": "न विगर्ह्य कथां कुर्याद्बहिर्माल्यं न धारयेत् ।\nन विगृह्य कथां कुर्याद्गवां च यानं पृष्ठेन सर्वथैव विगर्हितम् ॥ ४.७२॥",
  "transliteration": "na vigarhya kathāṁ kuryād bahirmālyaṁ na dhārayet |\nna vigṛhya kathāṁ kuryād gavāṁ ca yānaṁ pṛṣṭhena sarvathaiva vigarhitam || 4.72||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not engage in discourse that provokes criticism; one must not wear garlands externally. One must not engage in discourse that incites reproach, nor should one ride cattle from behind—such conduct is universally condemned.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not personal desire.",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and its sequential manifestation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of inner purity over external display.",
    "Restoration logic demands cessation of actions that misalign consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved by abandoning behavior that invites societal disapproval."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being engages in speech known to provoke criticism → THEN initiate completion process for speech discipline.",
    "IF a being wears external ornaments for show → THEN assign capacity-restoration protocol focused on internal dignity.",
    "IF a being rides cattle from behind → THEN activate social-integrity reintegration program.",
    "IF any action invites universal condemnation → THEN enforce immediate cessation without punitive attribution.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected via behavioral indicators → THEN deploy Nyaya-based realignment sequence."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies not in intent to offend but in the demonstrable alignment or misalignment of consciousness. Authority resides in restoring integrity rather than assigning blame. This verse establishes clear boundaries for dignified conduct applicable to all levels of society, including judicial officers.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that improper conduct stems from lack of self-awareness, not malice. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how improper discourse and adornment lead to further degradation of social harmony. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; hence correction precedes consequence. The non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering cannot purify what ignorance has obscured.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness realignment. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is now restored."
