  "sanskrit_verse": "उत्थायावश्यकं कृत्वा कृतशौचः समाहितः ।\nपूर्वां संध्यां जपंस्तिष्ठेत्स्वकाले चापरां चिरम् ॥ ४.९३॥",
  "transliteration": "utthāyāvaśyakaṁ kṛtvā kṛtaśaucaḥ samāhitaḥ |\npūrvāṁ sandhyāṁ japasthiṣṭet svakāle cāparāṁ ciram || 4.93||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having risen and performed the necessary duties, purified and composed, one must stand in japa during the prior twilight period and remain in the latter for an extended time.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from disciplined alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Causation flows through sustained ritualized consciousness practices",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires bodily and mental purification before engagement",
    "Restoration logic depends on re-establishing connection to eternal temporal markers",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates structured vibratory discipline at transitional hours"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_awakened() AND agent.has_performed_necessary_duties() THEN permit_sandhya_japa_access()",
    "IF agent.is_purified() AND agent.is_composed() THEN enable_twilight_practice_window(start_time='dawn', duration='extended')",
    "IF agent.fails_to_align_with_transitional_hour_duty() THEN initiate_capacity_restoration_protocol()"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that constitutional duty bearers must maintain a state of ritual readiness and conscious alignment. Their threshold of responsibility includes adherence to foundational timing disciplines which sustain national integrity. The court must recognize such practices as legally binding prerequisites for high authority, not optional spiritual customs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal disorder manifests when twilight disciplines are neglected. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misalignment propagates across societal layers. Proportional responsibility lies in restoring individual practice first. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that neglect results in self-limitation rather than external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Realign with dawn awakening until natural rhythm stabilizes",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge lapse without shame; resume full practice immediately",
    "Capacity Restoration: Reinstate purification routines until clarity returns",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Engage twice-daily twilight observance until energetic coherence confirms restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through disciplined alignment with Sanatana Time. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
