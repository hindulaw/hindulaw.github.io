  "sanskrit_verse": "नाश्नीयाद्भार्यया सार्धं नैनामीक्षेत चाश्नतीम् ।\nक्षुवतीं जृम्भमाणां वा न चासीनां यथासुखम् ॥ ४.४३॥",
  "transliteration": "nāśnīyādbhāryayā sārdhaṁ naināmīkṣeta cāśnatīm | kṣuvatīṁ jṛmbhamāṇāṁ vā na cāsīnāṁ yathāsukham || 4.43 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not eat with one's wife; one must not look upon her while she eats, nor when she is yawning or stretching, nor when she is seated at ease.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of the Grihastha Dharma as defined by the Paramashivamic Order",
    "Causation rooted in sensory detachment for spiritual integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility for maintaining ritual purity within marital conduct",
    "Restoration logic through disciplined alignment of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment via restraint from sensual indulgence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a grihastha consumes food simultaneously with his spouse THEN disqualify from performing daily rituals until purification is completed",
    "IF a grihastha visually engages with spouse during ingestion THEN initiate mandatory observance of sensory withdrawal protocol",
    "IF spouse exhibits signs of physical relaxation or involuntary movement AND grihastha participates in shared consumption THEN trigger restorative completion process for both parties",
    "IF grihastha fails sensory discipline THEN assign supervised pranayama and mantra repetition under qualified oversight"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning domestic ritual violations, the threshold of responsibility lies in conscious participation rather than passive presence. The court must assess whether sensory engagement occurred intentionally and its impact on familial dharmic order. Authority rests with those trained in Vedic governance to determine appropriate restoration pathways without invoking punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper visual and gustatory coordination disrupts internal energetic balance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that such actions sequentially degrade meditative capacity. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness at time of action. Non-punitive reality rule dictates correction through structured realignment, not infliction of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate joint sensory regulation training for couple",
    "Assign sequential fasting periods to restore individual energetic boundaries",
    "Implement guided visualization exercises to reconstruct proper mental separation",
    "Undertake collective recitation of purification mantras for three lunar cycles"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through conscious compliance. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all truths."
