  "sanskrit_verse": "पांसुवर्षे दिशां दाहे गोमायुविरुते तथा ।\nश्वखरोष्ट्रे च रुवति पङ्क्तो च न पठेद्द्विजः ॥ ४.११५॥",
  "transliteration": "pāṃsuvarṣe diśāṃ dāhe gomāyuvirute tathā |\nśvakharoṣṭre ca ruvti paṅkto ca na paṭheddvijaḥ || 4.115||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When dust falls like rain, when the sky burns in all directions, when jackals and vultures cry out, and when asses, donkeys, camels, and oxen bellow, a twice-born should not recite the Veda.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is context-sensitive and environment-responsive",
    "Causation includes atmospheric and cosmic conditions affecting spiritual capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with external purity for internal practice",
    "Restoration logic demands suspension of ritual action during chaotic environmental states",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates withdrawal from sacred acts under disruptive omens"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF atmospheric disruption indicators are present THEN ritual recitation by dvija SHALL BE suspended",
    "IF animal distress signals exceed threshold THEN Vedic engagement by qualified individuals SHALL BE paused",
    "IF directional fire or dust storm occurs THEN no dvija SHALL initiate scriptural reading UNTIL calm restores",
    "IF jackal or vulture cries exceed normative pattern THEN conscious practitioners SHALL withdraw from liturgical acts"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving ritual violations or contested ceremonial conduct, the Court shall assess whether environmental disruptions were present that would have lawfully suspended Vedic recitation. Responsibility lies not in omission but in misalignment with cosmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that sound, atmosphere, and creature behavior are valid epistemic sources indicating unfit conditions for recitation. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation: disturbance → incapacity → lawful suspension. There is no fault where capacity is naturally suspended; thus, punitive response is invalid.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion process: practitioner resumes recitation only after restoration of environmental harmony",
    "Responsibility assumption protocol: acknowledgment of natural incapacity replaces guilt attribution",
    "Capacity restoration mechanism: practitioner engages in preparatory purification until fit state returns",
    "Integrity reintegration pathway: community reaffirms alignment between individual practice and cosmic rhythm"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through recognition of lawful cessation under cosmic imbalance; reality remains non-punitive when capacity is withdrawn by nature's own decree; consciousness alone adjudicates true alignment."
