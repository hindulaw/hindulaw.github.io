  "sanskrit_verse": "सावित्रान् शान्तिहोमांश्च कुर्यात्पर्वसु नित्यशः । सावित्रान् शान्तिहोमांश्च पितॄंश्चैवाष्टकास्वर्चेन्नित्यमन्वष्टकासु च ॥ ४.१५०॥",
  "transliteration": "sāvitrān śāntihomāṃśca kuryātparvasu nityaśaḥ | sāvitrān śāntihomāṃśca pitṝṃścaivāṣṭakāsu rcennityamanvaṣṭakāsu ca || 4.150 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must perform Savitri recitations and peace offerings during festivals regularly; one must also offer Savitri recitations and peace offerings along with ancestral rites during the eight-day observances and in the subsequent fortnight.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Causation is established through ritual continuity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns individual action with universal order",
    "Restoration logic operates via sustained spiritual discipline",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures dharmic participation in societal harmony"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person performs Savitri and Shanti Homa during Parva THEN their social standing remains ritually valid",
    "IF a person omits Savitri and Shanti Homa during Ashṭaka AND Anvaṣṭaka THEN initiate completion protocol within three lunar cycles",
    "IF ancestral rites are neglected THEN assign guided ritual restoration under qualified priestly supervision",
    "IF ritual omission occurs due to incapacity THEN reallocate duty proportionally based on current capacity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning ritual omission or neglect, the Supreme Court shall assess not intent nor negligence alone, but the degree of disruption caused to communal dharma-vyavastha. The threshold of responsibility lies in measurable dissonance introduced into the collective field. Authority resides in restoring coherence, not assigning blame.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal sequence follows observance or its absence. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as disruption when rituals cease. Proportional responsibility is determined by the extent of deviation from cyclical dharmic rhythm. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment creates disharmony which must be resolved through conscious re-entry rather than punitive measures.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: missed Savitri and Homa must be performed within corrective window",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol: individual must publicly reaffirm commitment to ritual cycle",
    "Implement capacity restoration: if incapable, delegate partial duties until full capacity returns",
    "Execute integrity reintegration: community acknowledgment of restored alignment upon fulfillment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Ritual omission dissolves upon conscious correction. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
