  "transliteration": "na dharmasyāpadeśena pāpaṃ kṛtvā vrataṃ caret |\nvratena pāpaṃ pracchādya kurvan strīśūdradambhanam || 4.198 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who commits sin and then undertakes a vow to conceal it, deceiving women and Shudras thereby—such conduct is a distortion of dharma and invalidates the vow.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Vows derive validity only from alignment with pure intention and truthful action.",
    "Causation: Concealment of wrongdoing through ritual performance distorts dharmonic field.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The capacity to deceive reflects a misalignment of consciousness, not mere error.",
    "Restoration logic: Deception must be undone by re-establishing transparency and integrity in relational fields.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Ritual without inner purification creates further dissonance in collective consciousness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual performs a vow WHILE knowingly concealing prior transgression THEN the vow is void ab initio.",
    "IF a vow causes deception towards women OR Shudras THEN automatic restoration protocol initiates via truth-reclamation process.",
    "IF ritual observance is used as mechanism of concealment THEN legal system shall invoke completion process until original integrity restored.",
    "IF consciousness distortion detected via behavioral pattern THEN assign guidance under qualified preceptor until clarity returns."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any invocation of religious or dharmic practice that masks underlying misconduct must be reviewed for intent alignment. Where concealment is established, court must issue directives for public correction and restoration rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal sequence: first sin, then vow to obscure. This violates anupūrvaśaḥ. Responsibility lies in restoring clarity, not inflicting consequence. Truth-reclamation aligns consciousness back to dharma-field.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate public declaration of concealed act by offender to restore energetic balance.",
    "Assign completion task requiring service to those deceived until relational harmony restored.",
    "Implement guided reflection period under spiritual supervision to realign intention.",
    "Reintegrate offender into community only after verified restoration of transparent conduct."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored. There is no punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates. Reality remains non-punitive."
