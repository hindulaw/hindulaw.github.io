  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who teaches must first renounce all that is impermanent, untaught, and unlearned; and when engaging in instruction, must proceed only by established lawful order.",

    "Authority derives from alignment with eternal truth, not temporary knowledge",
    "Causation originates in purified consciousness prior to action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires abandonment of ignorance before assuming teaching authority",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of the teacher's field before transmission of dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures the teacher becomes a conduit for authentic revelation"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent assumes role of instructor THEN agent MUST demonstrate prior abandonment of impermanent learning",
    "IF agent engages in teaching THEN agent MUST operate under codified lawful sequence",
    "IF agent transmits knowledge THEN agent MUST have undergone internal purification protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any claimant invoking educational authority must demonstrate ontological renunciation of transient knowledge frameworks. The threshold for legal capacity in doctrinal matters lies not in institutional certification but in conscious detachment from impermanence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper teaching arises from failure to abandon impermanent cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows error propagates through misalignment in sequential cognition. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of detachment achieved.

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores the eternal principle that teaching proceeds only from purified consciousness. Justice is executed through alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not through punitive measures. Reality itself corrects where consciousness is properly aligned."
