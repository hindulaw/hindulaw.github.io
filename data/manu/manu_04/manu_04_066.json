  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not wear footwear or garments worn by another; likewise, the sacred thread, ornaments, garlands, or ceremonial items belonging to others are not to be borne.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the integrity of personal alignment with one's own dharma",
    "Causation arises through conscious identification with objects that reflect inner status",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands recognition of ownership as a reflection of energetic sovereignty",
    "Restoration logic requires return to rightful possession and identity alignment",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when external symbols mirror internal spiritual station"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual assumes穿戴 of another’s symbolic or ritual item THEN initiate realignment protocol to restore original energetic boundary",
    "IF possession is transferred without consent THEN execute completion process to dissolve false identification",
    "IF sacred or status-bearing object is misused THEN invoke capacity-restoration mechanism for both parties",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving misuse or unauthorized assumption of another's ritual attire or insignia, the court shall assess not intent nor social harm, but disruption to consciousness coherence. The threshold of responsibility lies in whether the act caused energetic dissonance in either party, requiring restoration rather than punitive redress.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that personal articles carry subtle impressions linked to the wearer's consciousness. Misuse disrupts sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of authentic self-expression. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of interference with another's spiritual resonance field. Justice aligns not through penalty, but through recalibration of energetic boundaries.",
