  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The householder, by capacity, shall give to those who are diminished; distribution to beings must be executed without obstruction.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from capacity to sustain and support existence",
    "Causation is rooted in the unobstructed flow of conscious sustenance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility obligates resource allocation according to existential need",
    "Restoration logic demands active participation in the elevation of diminished consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through无私 giving and non-obstructive engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A possesses surplus resources AND entity B exhibits signs of diminishment THEN A MUST allocate portion of surplus to B",
    "IF agent X obstructs resource distribution THEN X's operational capacity SHALL be realigned until obstruction ceases",
    "IF household-level actor holds property THEN proportional obligation to distribute exists based on local diminishment metrics",
    "IF systemic diminishment detected THEN automated redistribution protocols initiate within jurisdictional scope"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this axiom establishes that sovereign entities and high-capacity actors bear constitutional obligations for distributive justice. Obstruction of such flows constitutes actionable misalignment with foundational Dharma. Responsibility thresholds are determined by measurable surplus capacity, not intent or economic theory.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that diminishment manifests sequentially due to obstructed resource flow. The householder’s śakti creates causal duty. Responsibility aligns proportionally with capacity, not fault. Non-punitive enforcement restores the obstructed channel, enabling natural Dharma flow without coercion or shame.",

    "Completion Process: Householder engages in direct transfer until equilibrium restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Obstructor enters supervised redistribution cycle",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
