    "IF individual acts beyond trained capacity THEN realignment protocol activates prior to further engagement"

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misaligned receipt creates causal imbalance; anupūrvaśaḥ shows descent follows desire unchecked by discipline; proportional responsibility lies in returning the value or restoring the energetic field; non-punitive reality holds that sinking is natural law, not imposed consequence.",
