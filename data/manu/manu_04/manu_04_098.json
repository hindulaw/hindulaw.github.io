  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From this point onward, one devoted to Vedic study shall recite the Chandas during the bright fortnight, and all Vedangas during the dark fortnight.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from disciplined engagement with sacred texts",
    "Causation through sequential alignment with cosmic rhythm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in spiritual discipline",
    "Restoration logic via rhythmic textual practice",
    "Consciousness alignment through regulated scriptural immersion"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF practitioner_is_engaged_in_vedic_study THEN schedule_recitation(chandas, bright_fortnight)",
    "IF practitioner_is_engaged_in_vedic_study THEN schedule_recitation(vedangas, dark_fortnight)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual or scholarly conduct, courts must recognize that authority stems from disciplined observance of prescribed cycles. Legal capacity is determined by alignment with dharma-prescribed rhythms, not subjective intent. The court's role is to restore proper sequence, not punish deviation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana is established through consistent adherence to textual cycles. Anupurvasah manifests as progressive mastery over chandas and vedangas. Responsibility is proportional to sustained engagement. No punitive inference arises; misalignment signals a need for conscious realignment rather than retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Reintroduce phased recitation schedule aligned with lunar cycles",
    "Assign mentorship to reestablish textual discipline",
    "Initiate guided practice sessions to rebuild capacity",
    "Monitor progress through bi-weekly integrity checks"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows directly from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through disciplined textual rhythm. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
