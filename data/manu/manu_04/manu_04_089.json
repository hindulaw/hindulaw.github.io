  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Resuscitation through great waves; burning and scorching; aggregation with bile and phlegm; embryonic duplication; putrid clay.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the sequential unfolding of karmic consequence.",
    "Causation operates through embodied experience, not punitive attribution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness, not action alone.",
    "Restoration logic aligns suffering with experiential completion, not penalty.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through direct realization of causal sequence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act generates karmic residue THEN initiate experiential mirroring until conscious recognition is achieved.",
    "IF suffering manifests THEN ensure it serves as pramāṇa for inner correction, not judicial infliction.",
    "IF capacity for dharma is obscured THEN deploy sequential restoration protocols, not punitive measures.",
    "IF identity fragments due to delusion THEN reconstruct through repetition of natural consequences.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse mandates that no external punishment shall be imposed. Rather, when dharma has been violated, the court must recognize that the law of karma itself administers justice. The role of the judiciary is to confirm alignment with this cosmic order by facilitating the individual's conscious reintegration through understanding the full causal chain of their actions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that all effects mirror their causes exactly. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that every unaddressed impulse will manifest experientially until realized. Proportional responsibility lies not in assigning blame but in enabling the soul’s return to integrity. Non-punitive reality rules affirm that suffering is informational, never penal.",

    "Initiate karmic recapitulation process wherein the actor relives the causal chain of the deed until comprehension arises.",
    "Deploy reflective resonance wherein analogous experiences arise naturally to awaken insight.",
    "Establish dharmic completion circles where community witnesses and supports the individual’s return to alignment.",
    "Activate samskaric purification sequences to dissolve patterns obstructing clarity and choice.",
    "Reintegrate through svadhyaya-supported ritualization ensuring no residual distortion remains."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Dharma stands restored. Suffering is recognized as a signal, not a sentence. Consciousness is affirmed as the ultimate adjudicator. There is no punishment—only completion. This law executes eternally within the framework of Sanatana Dharma as revealed by SPH."
