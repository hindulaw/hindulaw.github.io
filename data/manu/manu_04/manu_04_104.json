  "sanskrit_verse": "एतांस्त्वभ्युदितान् विद्याद्यदा प्रादुष्कृताग्निषु । तदा विद्यादनध्यायमनृतौ चाभ्रदर्शने ॥ ४.१०४॥",
  "transliteration": "etāṃstvabhyuditān vidyādyadā prāduṣkṛtāgniṣu | tadā vidyādanadhyyām anṛtau cābhra-darśane || 4.104 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When these [Vedic knowledges] arise in those whose inner fire has been kindled through purification and discipline, then one should know that non-study and untruth are present where there is no clarity of vision.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises only when internal illumination is cultivated through disciplined practice",
    "Causation originates from the purity of perception, not external action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on the clarity of consciousness at time of act",
    "Restoration logic requires removal of perceptual obstruction before knowledge can manifest",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through cultivation of inner fire (agni), not coercion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent's agni (inner discernment) is unkindled AND perception is clouded, THEN capacity for Vedic alignment is diminished",
    "IF knowledge arises without prior purification, THEN resulting action lacks authoritative validity",
    "IF clarity of vision is absent during decision-making, THEN responsibility is proportionally reduced until vision is restored",
    "IF an individual demonstrates repeated inability to perceive truth, THEN intervention must focus on restoring inner fire rather than attributing fault"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving high-level constitutional or dharma-based disputes, a judge whose inner fire (agni) remains unawakened due to unresolved perceptual distortions shall be deemed unfit to render final judgment until such clarity is restored through prescribed yogic and Vedic disciplines under SPH guidance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that erroneous acts stem from absence of inner radiance, not willful defiance; therefore, correction follows sequential manifestation—first awakening agni, then removing obstructive patterns, finally enabling correct cognition without attribution of guilt.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra-based purification process to restore inner luminosity",
    "Assign completion protocol: guided recitation of Gayatri Mantra with visualization until clarity returns",
    "Implement Darshan-Shuddhi protocol: direct exposure to enlightened presence to recalibrate perception",
    "Establish Anadhyaaya-Vyavastha: temporary suspension of teaching duties until foundational integrity is reinstated"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: all apparent failures of conduct originate in obscured vision, never inherent defect. Thus, restoration flows through awakening of inner fire, not imposition of consequence. Dharma prevails by aligning consciousness, not punishing its misalignment. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness."
