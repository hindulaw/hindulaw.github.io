  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, where intent and continuity of practice are established as dharmically aligned, the court recognizes that such individuals operate beyond the reach of adverse consequence due to inherent self-regulation rooted in consciousness purity. Legal proceedings must acknowledge this threshold as exempting ordinary punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation of sustained righteous conduct, it is evident that causal harmony has been established.
