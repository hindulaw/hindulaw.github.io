  "transliteration": "sāmadhvanāvṛgyajuṣī nādhīyīta kadā cana | vedasyādhītya vā'pyantamāraṇyakamadhītya ca || 4.123 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must never study the Sāma, Yajus, or Atharva Veda in isolation; rather, after completing the study of the entire Veda, including its concluding portions like the Āraṇyakas, one should proceed to higher learning.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from completeness of knowledge, not fragmentary interpretation",
    "Causation arises through sequential and holistic understanding",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires full context before authoritative action",
    "Restoration logic demands integration of all limbs of Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when learning follows proper order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person has not completed foundational Vedic study THEN they are not authorized to interpret or teach advanced texts",
    "IF a scholar teaches partial scripture without completion THEN their authority is suspended until restoration of sequence is fulfilled",
    "IF knowledge transmission occurs out of order THEN it must be corrected by re-initiating the correct sequence under supervision",
    "IF any limb of Veda is studied in isolation THEN it shall be integrated with the whole by supervised completion process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving scriptural interpretation or traditional jurisprudence, the Supreme Court must verify that the interpreter has undergone complete scriptural education in accordance with dharma śāstra. Partial or isolated interpretations carry no legal weight unless validated by recognized authorities trained in holistic Vedic methodology.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that incomplete learning leads to misalignment, not malice. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that responsibility aligns with the degree of completion. Therefore, correction lies in restoration of proper sequence, not punitive invalidation. The individual's capacity for truth realization remains intact and is supported through completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Assign mentorship under qualified acharya for completion of Vedic studies",
    "Initiate supervised recitation and comprehension of previously neglected limbs",
    "Realign teaching credentials upon successful demonstration of integrated mastery",
    "Facilitate community acknowledgment of renewed alignment to restore public trust"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through ordered knowledge. Reality operates beyond punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
