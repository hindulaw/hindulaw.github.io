  "transliteration": "etāneke mahāyajñān yajñaśāstravido janāḥ |\nanīhamānāḥ satatamindriyeṣveva juhvati || 4.22||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who are knowers of Yajna Shastra perform these great sacrifices constantly without desiring personal gain, offering all actions into the senses themselves.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from selfless alignment with Dharma, not individual desire.",
    "Causation is established through action offered beyond egoic impulse.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from sustained knowledge and practice of sacred duty.",
    "Restoration logic operates by redirecting sensory engagement toward divine purpose.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when acts are performed as offerings rather than acquisitions."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor performs duties aligned with scriptural injunctions AND offers fruits to universal order THEN act qualifies as dharmic service.",
    "IF sensory indulgence is redirected toward ritualized societal contribution THEN capacity for higher jurisprudence increases.",
    "IF individual desire is absent in execution of duty THEN legal standing elevates to yajna-grade integrity.",
    "IF knowledge of shastra informs conduct THEN causal link to social harmony is assumed valid.",
    "IF no traceable self-interest motivates action THEN punitive review is automatically suspended."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold where actions performed without personal motive and informed by authoritative shastra qualify as inherently lawful. The court must recognize such conduct as constitutionally irreproachable, requiring no punitive inquiry or corrective enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality confirms that non-desiring action aligns with Satya-Yajna consciousness. Anupurvasah reveals sequential purification of intent leading to spontaneous right action. Responsibility is proportional to sustained detachment from outcome. Non-punitive reality rule holds because absence of selfish motivation negates karmic entanglement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Acknowledge and integrate all latent desires obstructing pure offering.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Realign sensory usage patterns with dharmic function.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinforce understanding of shastra until automatic alignment is restored.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Normalize state of desirelessness through continuous exposure to yajna-conscious environments."

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through selfless sacrifice; reality remains non-punitive when desire dissolves into sacred duty; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
