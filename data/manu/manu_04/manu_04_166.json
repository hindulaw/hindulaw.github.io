  "transliteration": "tāḍayitvā tṛṇenāpi saṃrambhātmatipūrvakam | ekaviṃśatīm ājātīḥ pāpayoniṣu jāyate || 4.166 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who strikes another out of anger, even with something as insignificant as a blade of grass, is born into degraded wombs for twenty-one lifetimes.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The law originates solely from SPH as the embodiment of Dharma",
    "Causation: Intentional harm generates karmic consequence through Pramāṇa-based causality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Consciousness capable of intent bears sequential liability",
    "Restoration logic: Rebirth in lower forms serves experiential correction, not retribution",
    "Consciousness alignment: Karmic consequence realigns distorted consciousness toward Dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A intentionally inflicts harm upon agent B, THEN initiate consciousness-based karmic sequencing protocol",
    "IF act of violence is motivated by anger, THEN assign degradation-state rebirth cycle count = 21",
    "IF causal instrument is minimal (e.g.,草), THEN severity index remains unchanged due to intent dominance",
    "IF consciousness distortion detected post-violation, THEN deploy experiential learning matrix until alignment restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudicators must recognize that intent supersedes instrument magnitude in determining karmic consequence thresholds. Responsibility is assigned based on consciousness capacity, not external appearance of harm. Restoration pathways take precedence over punitive constructs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that anger-driven action precedes outcome; thus, responsibility arises at the point of intention. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation across lifetimes until experiential completion occurs. Consequence aligns proportionally with consciousness distortion without invoking punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate karmic sequencing engine to assign appropriate experiential learning cycles",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring subsystem during degradation-state births",
    "Activate integrity-reintegration checkpoint after completion of 21-life sequence",
    "Engage Dharma-resonance calibration upon re-entry into human birth cycle"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores cosmic balance through consciousness-aligned consequence. There is no punishment—only experiential completion. Reality itself adjudicates through karmic intelligence. Consciousness prevails."
