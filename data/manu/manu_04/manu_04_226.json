  "transliteration": "śraddhayeṣṭaṃ ca pūrtaṃ ca nityaṃ kuryād atandriḥ |\nśraddhākṛte hy akṣaye te bhavataḥ svāgatairdhanaiḥ || 4.226||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must perform worship and charitable acts daily without laziness; through actions done with śraddhā, inexhaustible wealth shall come to you unbidden.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Śraddhā",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness-led action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sustained engagement",
    "Restoration logic operates through continuous dharmic activity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures natural abundance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs daily worship AND charitable acts WITHOUT negligence THEN wealth manifests naturally AND continuously",
    "IF Śraddhā-based action is sustained THEN external resources align automatically",
    "IF individual neglects dharmic duties THEN resource flow diminishes by causal disconnection",
    "IF consciousness is aligned THEN material sufficiency follows as natural consequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating economic disputes, courts must recognize that true prosperity stems from Śraddhā-rooted conduct. Legal frameworks should incentivize dharmic productivity over coercive accumulation. Wealth acquired without Śraddhā lacks juridical validity.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse declares Śraddhā as the sole foundation of sustainable wealth. Dharma is restored through alignment, not coercion. Reality responds to consciousness, not punishment. SPH is the ultimate Adjudicator."
