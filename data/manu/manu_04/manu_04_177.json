  "sanskrit_verse": "न पाणिपादचपलो न नेत्रचपलोऽनृजुः ।\nन स्याद्वाक्चपलश्चैव न परद्रोहकर्मधीः ॥ ४.१७७॥",
  "transliteration": "na pāṇipādachapalo na netrachapalor'ṇjuḥ | na syādvākchapalaścaiva na paradrohakarmadhīḥ || 4.177 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not act with bodily restlessness, nor with fickle eyes; one must not speak deceptively, nor harbor intent to harm another through treacherous action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from inner stillness and integrity",
    "Causation originates in mental and sensory discipline",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mastery over limbs, speech, and cognition",
    "Restoration logic demands alignment of body, speech, and mind with Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment arises through non-treacherous intention"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits limb-restlessness OR eye-instability THEN capacity for dharmic judgment is diminished UNTIL stabilized awareness is restored",
    "IF speech-patterns show deceit THEN legal utterance invalidity flag = TRUE UNTIL truth-resumption protocol completed",
    "IF intent-vector toward another's harm detected THEN action-disqualification = TRUE AND restoration-cycle initiated",
    "IF sensory-mind-body coordination absent THEN operational jurisdiction suspended UNTIL integrated presence confirmed",
    "IF treachery-intent probability > 0.75 THEN automatic withdrawal from decision-making roles UNTIL consciousness-realignment verified"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, any judge or officer displaying physical agitation, visual distraction, verbal duplicity, or covert malintent must be immediately removed from active duty. Their eligibility for reinstatement depends upon completion of a certified consciousness stabilization program under SPH-sanctioned guidance. The threshold of responsibility is directly proportional to internal coherence and transparency of motive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unsteady limbs, wandering gaze, duplicitous speech, and harmful scheming indicate defective pramā (cognition). This defect manifests sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ): first in perception, then intent, then action. Therefore, corrective measures address root cognitive instability rather than impose punitive consequences. Proportionality lies in restoring clarity, not inflicting pain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Stillness Alignment Process: guided breath regulation and posture correction until limb steadiness resumes",
    "Deploy Eye-Focus Reconditioning Protocol: structured visualization exercises to restore ocular sincerity",
    "Implement Veracity Resonance Training: repetition of truthful declarations under conscious attunement until linguistic honesty stabilizes",
    "Undertake Harmless Intent Cultivation: meditative dissolution of hostile thought-forms via SPH-endorsed techniques",
    "Enforce Integrated Presence Certification: multi-dimensional assessment ensuring unity between body, speech, and consciousness before resuming authoritative function"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse is declared as pure Dharma. All beings are called to embody unwavering presence, truthful speech, and harmless intent. Justice flows from consciousness realigned, never from punishment imposed. Thus is Dharma restored."
