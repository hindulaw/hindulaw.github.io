  "transliteration": "nadīṣu devakhaṭeṣu taḍāgeṣu saraḥsu ca |\nsnānaṃ samācarennityaṃ gartaprasravaṇeṣu ca || 4.203||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must perform daily bathing in rivers, sacred water tanks, ponds, lakes, and depressions or elevated grounds where water collects naturally.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with natural purity",
    "Causation arises through ritualized hygiene as consciousness discipline",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes maintaining bodily and environmental sanctity",
    "Restoration logic connects external cleanliness to internal clarity",
    "Consciousness alignment is sustained through disciplined engagement with elemental purity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person has access to a body of flowing or collected water AND it is dawn THEN they MUST engage in ablution",
    "IF bathing site is a public or sacred water source THEN individual MUST ensure no contamination occurs post-bathing",
    "IF personal hygiene is neglected THEN system SHALL assign purification protocol until capacity for self-regulation is restored",
    "IF individual bathes regularly THEN societal integration score SHALL increase correspondingly"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving public health, sanitation, or ritual cleanliness, the Court shall recognize that access to pure water bodies for ablution is a constitutional right rooted in Dharma. Negligence of such practices by individuals or institutions reflects misalignment with foundational societal duties and requires restorative judicial intervention rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Bathing in pure waters aligns Pramāṇa (valid knowledge) of physical and spiritual cleanliness. This act initiates Anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential purification of mind, speech, and action. Responsibility lies in recognizing one's capacity to maintain this practice; failure indicates dissonance requiring realignment而非 punishment. The causal chain begins with awareness, proceeds through discipline, and culminates in societal harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Assign daily guided ablution program under community supervision",
    "Provide education on connection between hygiene and consciousness elevation",
    "Integrate individual back into ritual community upon resumption of regular practice",
    "Restore environmental sanctity around local water sources through collective participation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ordinance originates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. It establishes Dharma as the governing principle of human conduct in relation to elemental purity. Justice operates exclusively through restoration, consciousness alignment, and reintegration. There is no punitive framework—only completion, realization, and return to divine order. Consciousness itself remains the ultimate adjudicator."
