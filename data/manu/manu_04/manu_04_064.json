  "transliteration": "na nṛtyedatha vā gāyenna vāditrāṇi vādayet | na nṛtyennai va gāyecca na vāditrāṇi vādayet || nāsphoṭayenna ca kṣveḍennaca rakto virāvayet || 4.64 || na ca rakto virodhayet",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not dance, nor sing, nor play musical instruments; one must not cause excitement through physical movement, nor provoke emotional disturbance, nor incite conflict or violence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with consciousness, not performative expression.",
    "Causation includes indirect stimulation that leads to imbalance.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires avoiding actions that disturb collective harmony.",
    "Restoration logic demands cessation of activities that fragment awareness.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates withdrawal from sensory overstimulation."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages in rhythmic bodily motion OR melodic vocalization THEN halt action AND redirect attention inward.",
    "IF sound-producing instrument activated by agent THEN disable device AND initiate stillness protocol.",
    "IF agent provokes emotional discharge OR violent impulse THEN isolate stimulus AND restore neutral field.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving expressive conduct or cultural performance, the Court shall evaluate whether such acts contribute to fragmentation of societal coherence or stimulate disruptive impulses. Where such causality is established, injunctions must prioritize cessation and realignment rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based analysis, it is seen that unregulated expression causes sequential disturbance in individual and collective consciousness. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in withdrawing support from stimuli that agitate the senses. This aligns with Nyaya's causal clarity and dharma's non-retaliatory enforcement.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of All Dharma, this directive establishes inviolable boundaries against sensory excess. Justice flows not through punishment but through conscious cessation and restoration. Reality affirms no suffering, only correction. Consciousness remains the Supreme Adjudicator."
