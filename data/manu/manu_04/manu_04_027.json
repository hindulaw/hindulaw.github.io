  "sanskrit_verse": "नानिष्ट्वा नवसस्येष्ट्या पशुना चाग्निमान् द्विजः ।\nनवान्नमद्यात्मांसं वा दीर्घमायुर्जिजीविषुः ॥ ४.२७॥",
  "transliteration": "nāniṣṭvā navasasyeṣṭyā paśunā cāgnimān dvijaḥ |\nnavānnamadyātmāṃsaṃ vā dīrghamāyurjijīviṣuḥ || 4.27||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born seeker desiring long life shall not consume new grain without first offering it with due ritual, nor meat, nor intoxicants, nor his own flesh.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual precedence establishes lawful engagement with sustenance.",
    "Causation: Consumption without offering disrupts cosmic alignment and personal longevity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The dvija's capacity to invoke divine order determines his dietary conduct.",
    "Restoration logic: Proper offering restores harmony between individual will and universal rhythm.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Dietary discipline aligns bodily intake with higher spiritual intention."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF seeker desires extended lifespan THEN MUST perform offering before consuming new grain",
    "IF dvija consumes meat OR intoxicants OR self-flesh WITHOUT prior yajña THEN action invalidates longevity intent",
    "IF dvija performs proper initiation THEN consumption aligns with dharma-sustained life extension"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning health, longevity, or ritual violation by twice-born citizens, this axiom establishes that intent alone cannot sustain lawful claim unless accompanied by prescribed ritual completion. Courts must verify presence or absence of yajña as threshold determinant of dharmic compliance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Consumption without offering creates sequential misalignment (anupūrvaśaḥ) in pramāṇa-based causality—misalignment manifests as diminished vitality rather than punitive consequence. Restoration occurs through re-performing offering, thereby realigning causal sequence toward intended outcome of prolonged life.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-perform full offering仪式 prior to next consumption cycle.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge lapse and reaffirm commitment to life-preserving discipline.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Engage in preparatory rituals to restore eligibility for sustenance.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Align future intake with sacrificial framework ensuring no repetition."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows from the eternal Sanatana Dharma, executed without punishment, restoring consciousness to its rightful sovereignty over matter. Dharma is hereby affirmed, reality remains non-punitive, and all actions realign under the witness of pure awareness."
