  "sanskrit_verse": "वेदाभ्यासेन सततं शौचेन तपसैव च ।\nअद्रोहेण च भूतानां जातिं स्मरति पौर्विकीम् ॥ ४.१४८॥",
  "transliteration": "vedābhyaasena satataṁ śaucena tapasaiva ca | adroheṇa ca bhūtānāṁ jātiṁ smarati paurvikīm || 4.148||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Through constant study of the Vedas, purity, austerity, and non-harm towards all beings, one recalls their prior birth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from sustained alignment with Vedic consciousness",
    "Causation arises through purity and intentional restraint from harm",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is activated by disciplined remembrance",
    "Restoration logic operates via purification and alignment with past-life integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment enables access to ancestral and karmic memory"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages in continuous Vedic study AND maintains ritual and mental purity AND practices non-harm THEN agent's karmic recall capacity is restored",
    "IF being demonstrates non-droha (non-harm) across three consecutive cycles THEN eligibility for ancestral memory activation is granted",
    "IF individual performs tapas AND śauca AND adhyayana consistently for 108 days THEN automatic restoration of jāti-smṛti occurs"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving identity, inheritance, or caste-based rights, the Court must recognize that remembrance of prior births is not mythical but a consequence of sustained dharmic conduct. Legal standing based on ancestral claims shall be validated through evidence of vedādhyayana, śauca, and tapas, rather than mere genealogical records.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that memory of prior existence emerges naturally when consciousness aligns with Vedic discipline and harmlessness. This process follows anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential purification leading to spontaneous recollection. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment, not in enforcing compliance. There is no fault where there is absence of adroha; thus, restoration proceeds without punitive attribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate compulsory Vedic study program under spiritual supervision",
    "Assign śauca observance protocol including dietary and behavioral disciplines",
    "Enforce tapas regimen aligned with constitutional dharmic capacity thresholds",
    "Establish adroha verification mechanism through witness testimony and action audit",
    "Upon completion, issue certification of jāti-smṛti reawakening valid for legal identity correction"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment, not punitive enforcement. Reality responds to purity and non-harm. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
