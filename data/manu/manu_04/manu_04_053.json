  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not blow into fire with the mouth while naked; one must not look upon a naked woman; one must not cast impure substances into the fire; nor should one warm the feet by it.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of ritual purity in sustaining cosmic order",
    "Causation through sensory discipline and bodily conduct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in awareness of elemental sanctity",
    "Restoration logic via alignment with sacred action (karma-yoga)",
    "Consciousness alignment through non-objectification and reverence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent interacts with sacred element WITHOUT prescribed covering THEN initiate purification protocol AND capacity-realignment process",

    "IF substance introduced to consecrated flame is deemed impure THEN halt transaction AND invoke cleansing sequence",
    "IF physical warmth sought from ritual fire THEN redirect to lawful thermal source AND educate on dharmic use"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving misuse of sacred elements or inappropriate exposure, the threshold of responsibility lies in conscious intent aligned with sensory discipline. The court must assess whether the act disrupts societal harmony or personal dharma, prioritizing restoration through reeducation and ritual rectification rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper interaction with fire or nudity breaches sequential causality (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility arises from failure to uphold purity-consciousness, not from moral fault. Correction follows natural consequence: misaligned energy distorts individual and collective field until realigned through intentional completion.",
