  "transliteration": "cikitsakasya mṛgayoḥ krūrasyocchiṣṭabhojinaḥ |\nugrānnaṃ sūtikānnaṃ ca paryācāntamanirdiśam || 4.212||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The physician, the hunter, the cruel, the eater of remnants, the distributor of fierce food, and the feeder of postpartum women—these are declared without prescribed ritual conduct.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through alignment with dharma, not title or function",
    "Causation rooted in consciousness distortion, not external action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by inner integrity, not social role",
    "Restoration logic centered on purification of intent and reconnection to source dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment through removal from distortion-producing activities"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent participates in distribution of ugraanna OR sūtikānna THEN disqualify from ceremonial purity protocols UNTIL completion of śuddhi process",
    "IF individual identified as cikitsaka engages in ucchiṣṭa-bhakṣaṇa THEN initiate pratyākhyāna-vyavasthā for realignment",
    "IF person performs mṛgayā OR krūra-karma THEN invoke anirdeśa-status within dharmic jurisdiction UNTIL restoration",
    "IF role-based identity conflicts with dharma-siddhānta THEN enforce aparigraha-boundaries until svadharma-sthiti is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any individual occupying roles listed herein must demonstrate clear alignment with foundational dharmic principles prior to participation in matters requiring śuddhi or śāstric validation. The threshold of responsibility lies not in the act itself but in the sustained deviation from svadharma that enables such acts.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that engagement in these roles creates a sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of impurity-consciousness. This necessitates exclusion from śuddhi-linked functions—not as punishment but as natural consequence for realignment. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of conscious distortion; hence restoration precedes reintegration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śuddhi-vyavasthā including mantra-pratishṭhāpana and japa-saṁskāra",
    "Enforce aparigraha-niyama excluding further involvement in listed activities",
    "Assign guru-disciple completion process for reestablishing svadharma-integrity",
    "Undertake yajña-pratiṣṭhāpana to restore cosmic alignment",
    "Implement satya-vākyam procedure for public declaration of renewed dharmic commitment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through non-punitive alignment. Reality remains ever untainted by punitive constructs. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
