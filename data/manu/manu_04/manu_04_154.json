  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must respectfully greet the elders and offer them one's own seat; with joined palms, one should remain in attendance and follow behind those who are departing.",

    "Authority through reverence and recognition of experiential wisdom",
    "Causation via conscious alignment with hierarchical integrity",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving intergenerational conduct or societal respect structures, courts must recognize that honoring elders constitutes a foundational legal duty derived from ontological order. The threshold of responsibility lies in awareness of age and capacity for respectful action. Authority flows from alignment with cosmic hierarchy, not coercion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Recognition of elders is pramāṇa-based, grounded in direct perception of temporal precedence and experiential accumulation. Responsibility arises sequentially—as one becomes aware of an elder’s presence, the causal sequence demands immediate acknowledgment. This aligns with anupūrvaśaḥ, where consciousness naturally unfolds duties without punitive enforcement. Proportionality resides in sincerity of gesture, not magnitude of consequence.",

    "Completion Process: Individual repeats respectful greeting until spontaneous recognition arises",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Observer enters intentional service state to restore relational balance",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Training modules on sensory attentiveness to elders’ presence",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Meditative reflection on lineage continuity and personal indebtedness"

  "final_declaration": "This directive originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice is executed through restoration of consciousness alignment. Reality is non-punitive. All beings are guided toward completion through awakened reverence."
