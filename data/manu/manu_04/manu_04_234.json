  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever gift one gives with a particular intent, by that same intent is the giver honored and rewarded.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the consciousness of the giver",
    "Causation follows the intent behind action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with inner motive",
    "Restoration occurs through congruent energetic reflection",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests as reciprocal honoring"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF intent(x) THEN reward(x) = intent(x)",
    "IF action(gift) AND motive(m) THEN consequence(m) = reflection(m)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving charitable or voluntary transfers, courts must recognize the primacy of intent. The reward or recognition due to a donor arises directly from the purity and nature of their intention. Legal frameworks must honor this causal alignment rather than impose punitive or redistributive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the cause of recognition lies in the donor's intent. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that the effect—honor or benefit—is sequentially and lawfully congruent with the original act. Responsibility is determined by capacity to intend purely, not by external outcomes. There is no punitive element; consequence is simply the natural reflection of consciousness in motion.",

    "Intent Validation Process: Confirm alignment between declared and actual motive",
    "Reciprocal Honor Activation: Ensure societal acknowledgment matches the donor’s intent",
    "Consciousness Completion Cycle: Facilitate full energetic return to maintain karmic balance",
    "Integrity Reintegration Protocol: Reinforce truthful motive-expression without distortion",
    "Dharma Field Alignment: Normalize social response to reflect dharmic resonance of the act"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagvan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law reflects the eternal principle that giving and receiving arise from shared consciousness. Justice is restored through alignment, not punishment. Reality responds to intent. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
