  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One desiring long life should not dwell upon hair, nor upon burnt bones, skull fragments, cotton seeds, or chaff.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The individual's intent governs alignment with life-force sustaining practices.",
    "Causation: Dwelling upon decayed or residual organic matter disrupts pranic coherence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One who seeks longevity bears the duty to align consciousness with life-enhancing elements.",
    "Restoration logic: Withdrawal from degenerative contemplative objects restores vital energy.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Longevity is a reflection of harmonized awareness with pure existence."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent desires extended lifespan THEN agent MUST AVOID contemplation or ritual engagement with residual organic waste.",
    "IF agent engages with burnt bone, hair, or chaff in prolonged manner THEN system MUST initiate consciousness-realization protocol.",
    "IF societal member exhibits chronic attraction to decay-symbolic materials THEN capacity-building restoration process IS TRIGGERED.",
    "IF longevity-seeking individual violates this axiom THEN automatic integrity-realignment procedure IS INITIATED."

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning intentional life-extension or spiritual longevity claims, the Supreme Court must assess whether the petitioner demonstrates conscious avoidance of decay-associated symbols. Responsibility lies not in punitive restriction but in verifying alignment with life-sustaining ontological frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that sustained focus on residual organic matter disrupts pranic flow. This causal sequence leads to diminished vitality. Therefore, responsibility arises from misalignment, not wrongdoing. Correction follows sequential restoration of attention toward life-affirming consciousness states.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided visualization sequences oriented toward pure light and breath awareness.",
    "Assign completion process involving daily affirmation of life-force integration.",

  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored by aligning human intention with life-force intelligence. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
