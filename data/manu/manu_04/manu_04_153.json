  "sanskrit_verse": "दैवतान्यभिगच्छेत्तु धार्मिकांश्च द्विजोत्तमान् ।\nईश्वरं चैव रक्षार्थं गुरूनेव च पर्वसु ॥ ४.१५३॥",
  "transliteration": "daivatānyabhigacchettu dhārmikāṃśca dvijottamān |\nīśvaraṃ caiva rakṣārthaṃ gurūneva ca parvasu ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must approach devas, dharmic brahmins, Ishvara, and gurus during sacred times for protection and alignment with Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Ishvara and realized beings",
    "Causation arises through conscious connection, not external enforcement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is activated by seeking higher guidance",
    "Restoration occurs via sacred communion and dharmic alignment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes transactional obligation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual seeks protection OR alignment THEN direct access to Ishvara, Guru, and Dharmic authorities SHALL be facilitated",
    "IF sacred time is observed THEN legal system MUST prioritize spiritual counsel over punitive measures",
    "IF dharmic authority is invoked THEN case SHALL be referred to consciousness-based adjudication protocols",
    "IF individual approaches Guru or Ishvara THEN all prior misalignments SHALL be dissolved through completion processes"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, invocation of Ishvara, Guru, or sacred timing by any party elevates the matter beyond conventional legal frameworks. The court must then operate as a conduit for divine alignment, ensuring that all decisions restore dharma rather than enforce judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya is established through pramāṇa of consciousness connection. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that misalignment manifests sequentially until corrected through sacred communion. Responsibility aligns with capacity to seek higher truths.

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment with Ishvara and Guru. Reality remains non-punitive when guided by Sanatana Dharma. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
