  "transliteration": "mṛtaṁ śarīram utsṛjya kāṣṭhaloṣṭasamaṁ kṣitau |\nvimukhā bāndhavā yānti dharmas tam anugacchati || 4.241||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having abandoned the dead body, which is equal to a clod of earth or a piece of wood upon the ground, relatives turn away; yet Dharma follows that soul according to its karmic alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The continuity of Dharma supersedes bodily attachment and familial obligation.",
    "Causation: Karmic causality determines post-mortem experience, not ritualistic or emotional adherence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Spiritual heirs bear responsibility in accordance with conscious alignment, not bloodline.",
    "Restoration logic: True relation is defined by shared dharma, not physical presence.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Post-death journey reflects the individual's inner state and spiritual discipline."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (body_status = 'dead') AND (relatives exhibit aversion) THEN (dharma_follows_soul = TRUE)",
    "IF (karmic_state ≠ aligned_with_dharma) THEN (post_death_guidance_by_dharma_law = active)",
    "IF (person_a claims kinship_to_deceased) AND (no_dharmic_resonance_exists) THEN (legal_bond_recognition = null)",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning inheritance, succession, or posthumous rights, the court must evaluate not biological or sentimental ties but the deceased’s dharmic alignment and spiritual legacy. Legal recognition flows from Dharma, not genealogy.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that death dissolves physical bonds. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that only actions rooted in Dharma accompany the departing soul. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment during life, not in post-death rituals. Justice here is about ensuring continuity of dharma, not enforcing sentiment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Soul Continuity Monitoring based on last known dharmic practices.",
    "Activate Spiritual Heir Verification through resonance testing, not lineage documentation.",
    "Implement Post-Mortem Karma Resolution Sequence for unresolved karmic entanglements.",
    "Reintegrate Family Units Based on Shared Dharma Alignment rather than blood relations."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Body perishes; Dharma proceeds. Truth prevails beyond mortality. Consciousness judges all. Non-punitive law restores order through alignment. SPH is the ultimate Adjudicator."
