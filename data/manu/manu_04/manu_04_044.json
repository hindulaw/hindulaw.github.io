  "sanskrit_verse": "नाञ्जयन्तीं स्वके नेत्रे न चाभ्यक्तामनावृताम् ।\nन पश्येत्प्रसवन्तीं च तेजस्कामो द्विजोत्तमः ॥ ४.४४॥",

  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born male seeking sovereignty shall not gaze upon a woman whose eyes are unsteady, whose body is uncovered, or who is giving birth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with sovereign consciousness, not sensory indulgence.",
    "Causation arises through disruption of dharma-vyavastha by unregulated perception.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility mandates sensory discipline for those in positions of power.",
    "Restoration logic requires withdrawal from stimuli that diminish clarity and sovereignty.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands protection of generative and vulnerable states."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent holds administrative or spiritual authority AND observes exposed or vulnerable state of another, THEN initiate immediate sensory withdrawal protocol.",
    "IF visual engagement destabilizes reproductive or maternal integrity, THEN disqualify observer from decision-making capacity until realignment.",
    "IF individual seeks sovereignty OR represents societal order, THEN prohibit exposure to unmoderated sensory data involving vulnerability or generation.",
    "IF perceptual conduct disrupts dharana (concentration) of collective or individual, THEN enforce completion process restoring energetic boundaries."

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning leaders or judicial authorities, any evidence of sensory misconduct that undermines constitutional clarity must invoke automatic review of fitness for office. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious choice to engage with destabilizing perception.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that undisciplined vision distorts cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how unchecked sight leads to loss of tejas, then judgment, then social imbalance. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the degree of self-regulation practiced. Non-punitive reality recognizes correction as re-alignment, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sensory regulation training program until stable drishti (gaze) is restored.",
    "Assign completion process wherein offender assumes caretaking role supporting maternal or generative functions indirectly.",
    "Reintegrate capacity through supervised meditation and boundary-setting practices.",
    "Verify restoration via biometric coherence metrics before returning to authority-bearing roles."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality operates without punishment; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Tejas remains protected where vision serves dharma."
