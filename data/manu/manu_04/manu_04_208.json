  "sanskrit_verse": "भ्रूणघ्नावेक्षितं चैव संस्पृष्टं चाप्युदक्यया ।\nपतत्रिणावलीढं च शुना संस्पृष्टमेव च ॥ ४.२०८॥",
  "transliteration": "bhruunaaghnaa vekshitaḿ caiva saḿspṛiṣhṭaḿ caapyudakyayaa |\npatatri.naalii.dhaḿ ca śhunaa saḿspṛiṣhṭameva ca ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which has been observed by one who destroys the embryo, touched by a menstruating woman, or contacted by a bird or dog — all such substances become ritually unfit due to conscious contamination through proximity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from ontological purity, not procedural formality.",
    "Causation arises from consciousness-aligned contact and intent.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to maintain sacred integrity.",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification and reintegration rather than exclusion.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of subtle energetic disruption."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity comes into sensory range of a Brūṇaghna THEN ritual status becomes contaminated.",
    "IF a menstruating woman touches an object THEN its ritual usability deactivates until purification.",
    "IF an object is touched by birds OR dogs THEN it requires consecration before reuse in dharma-kriyā.",
    "IF contamination occurs THEN automatic restoration protocol initiates via qualified practitioner assignment.",
    "IF capacity for contamination exists THEN responsibility lies with the contaminator’s purified state restoration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual pollution or spiritual harm, the threshold of responsibility rests on awareness and proximity. The court must recognize that contamination is not punitive but operational—a signal for realignment. Authority flows from the capacity to restore purity, not punish impurity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through direct perception (pratyakṣa) and inference (anumāna). Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how contamination unfolds sequentially through sensory engagement. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of conscious involvement. Non-punitive reality recognizes that impurity signals misalignment, requiring completion rather than condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification rituals under guidance of initiated authority.",
    "Assign completion process to neutralize energetic residue.",
    "Reintegrate affected parties after attestation of restored sanctity.",
    "Establish witness protocol to prevent recurrence through awareness cultivation.",
    "Document restoration sequence for future reference and systemic learning."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law proceeds from pure consciousness. Dharma is restored through recognition and realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
