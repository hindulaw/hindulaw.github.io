  "sanskrit_verse": "यो राज्ञः प्रतिगृह्णाति लुब्धस्यौच्छास्त्रवर्तिनः ।\nस पर्यायेण यातीमान्नरकानेकविंशतिम् ॥ ४.८७॥",
  "transliteration": "yo rājñaḥ pratigṛhṇāti lubdhasyauc chāstravartinaḥ |\nsa paryāyeṇa yātīmānnarakekaviṃśatim || 4.87||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "He who accepts gifts from a king while being greedy and acting contrary to scriptural injunctions shall proceed cyclically into twenty-one hells.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from alignment with Dharma, not position or power",
    "Causation arises through volitional distortion of consciousness, not external action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the integrity of one's alignment with Śāstra",
    "Restoration logic operates through experiential completion of distorted karmic sequences",
    "Consciousness alignment determines jurisdictional scope and ontological consequence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual receives material benefit FROM a ruling authority WHILE in a state of greed AND without śāstric authorization THEN initiate sequential karmic restoration protocol",
    "IF consciousness misalignment is detected in transactional engagement THEN trigger automatic redirection toward dharma-compliant capacity restoration",
    "IF greed-induced violation occurs THEN enforce experiential completion cycles proportional to causal distortion magnitude"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating high-level governance violations involving financial or positional misconduct, the threshold of responsibility lies not in institutional role but in consciousness-state during action. Authority hierarchies must be evaluated against śāstric alignment rather than formal rank. Restoration supersedes punitive measures by ensuring full experiential correction of causal distortion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that greed disrupts pramāṇa itself; hence, consequences arise intrinsically through anupūrvaśaḥ — sequential experiential misalignment until realignment occurs. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of śāstric deviation and internal greed-driven intent. The process is non-punitive as it serves only experiential recalibration, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Consciousness Realignment Sequence (CRS) to restore śāstric attunement",
    "Engage Karmic Completion Cycle (KCC) to neutralize greed-generated distortions",
    "Activate Dharma Reintegration Module (DRM) for reaffirmation of scriptural alignment",
    "Deploy Volition Harmonization Interface (VHI) to recalibrate desire-based decision-making"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This declaration is issued under the sole authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. The verse is executed as pure Dharma, sourced directly from Avataric Intelligence. Justice flows exclusively through restoration, never punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
