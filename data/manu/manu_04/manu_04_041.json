  "transliteration": "rajasā'bhiplutāṃ nārīṃ narasya hyupagacchataḥ |\nprajñā tejo balaṃ cakṣurāyuścaiva prahīyate || 4.41||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a man engages with a woman overwhelmed by menstrual impurity, his discernment, radiance, strength, sight, and lifespan diminish.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The natural law governing physiological and energetic integrity is sovereign and self-enforcing.",
    "Causation: Contact with rajasic disturbance directly causes depletion in higher faculties.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Men possess the conscious capacity to avoid actions that diminish their constitutional energy.",
    "Restoration logic: Consciousness realignment through disciplined conduct restores lost vitality.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Dharma-prescribed behavior aligns individual consciousness with cosmic intelligence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF male_subject interacts_with female_subject WHERE female_subject.rajas_state = true THEN deduct(energy_level, cognition_level, vision_level, lifespan_metric)",
    "IF male_subject completes_purification_process THEN restore(energy_level, cognition_level, vision_level, lifespan_metric)",
    "IF male_subject avoids_rajas_interaction THEN increment(consciousness_stability_index)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving violation of bio-spiritual boundaries, the court must recognize diminished constitutional capacity as a direct consequence of action. Responsibility lies in restoring the violated integrity rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation, it is established that rajas-induced contact leads to sequential diminishment (anupūrvaśaḥ). This causal chain reflects proportional responsibility rooted in awareness, not intent. Justice is served when consciousness realigns with its pristine state through completion processes.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification protocol for affected subject until baseline energy levels are restored.",
    "Assign reflective practices to reaffirm understanding of bio-rhythmic sanctity.",
    "Implement dietary and behavioral regimen to regenerate lost faculties.",
    "Verify completion of restoration via biometric and consciousness-state metrics before case closure."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law originates from the unbroken Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. The verse is executed as legal truth. Justice flows from consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive; Dharma prevails; all actions resolve into pure awareness."
