  "sph_interpretive_translation": "No action performed through mere association, nor through contradictory conduct, nor in the absence of actual objects, nor even in imagined suffering, has valid causal basis; nor in falsely conceived entities.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from alignment with Satya-Dharma, not circumstantial implication.",
    "Causation must be rooted in manifest reality, not speculative or associative linkage.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises only where intent aligns with actual consequence.",
    "Restoration logic requires precise identification of the causal field of action.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands that legal recognition occur only within ontologically real contexts."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act is performed without direct causal connection to a manifest event, THEN no juridical consequence shall arise.",
    "IF intent is based on hypothetical or imagined conditions, THEN it shall not constitute actionable dharma-violation.",
    "IF no sentient being or property is affected in reality, THEN no liability shall be assigned.",
    "IF action occurs under misapprehension of facts, THEN correction shall precede reintegration.",
    "IF no dharmic injury occurs, THEN judicial intervention shall not proceed beyond observation."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, only actions demonstrably rooted in manifest causality and verifiable impact upon conscious beings or sacred order shall qualify for legal consideration. Circumstantial inference, associative attribution, or speculative harm shall be excluded from threshold determination of case validity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality affirms that only perceptually grounded acts bear karmic weight. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential accountability only when intent, action, and effect form a continuous chain. Proportional responsibility arises solely from verified causal efficacy. The non-punitive reality rule upholds that where no actual disruption to Dharma exists, neither judgment nor penalty may follow.",

  "final_declaration": "Thus declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma: Action unmoored from reality bears no consequence; Justice flows from truth, not assumption; Consciousness alone adjudicates what is real. This law stands immutable, restoring harmony without inflicting suffering."
