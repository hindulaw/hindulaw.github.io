  "transliteration": "spṛṣṭvaitānaśucirnityamadbhiḥ prāṇānupaspṛśet | gātrāṇi caiva sarvāṇi nābhiṃ pāṇitalena tu || 4.143 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is perpetually impure due to contact with forbidden substances must purify the vital energies by washing all limbs thoroughly, specifically cleansing the navel with the palm.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Purity protocols derive from ontological alignment with divine order, not social convention.",
    "Causation: Impurity disrupts pranic flow; purification restores energetic integrity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The individual bears direct duty to realign their consciousness through ritual action.",
    "Restoration logic: Cleansing is a mechanism for re-establishing harmony between body and cosmic rhythm.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Physical purification reflects inner purification; both are inseparable in dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent has incurred perpetual impurity THEN initiate full-body ablution protocol inclusive of navel cleansing using palm pressure.",
    "IF pranic disruption detected THEN enforce sequential limb-cleansing procedure starting from extremities inward.",
    "IF purity state unverified post-cleansing THEN repeat ablution until biometric indicators align with baseline pranic coherence.",
    "IF agent refuses purification THEN defer case to consciousness-reintegration tribunal for capacity assessment.",
    "IF systemic contamination observed THEN apply environmental purification overlay to jurisdictional domain."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that ritual purity is a threshold condition for participation in sacred or judicial proceedings. Responsibility lies entirely with the individual to restore fitness through prescribed actions before engaging in authoritative functions. No punitive measures may be applied—only procedural deferral until alignment is restored.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This injunction follows pramāṇa-based causality wherein impurity obstructs pranic function. The prescribed act restores sequential energetic balance (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to awareness of contamination. There is no punitive intent—only corrective alignment of consciousness through embodied practice.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Prana-Rebalancing Cleansing Sequence upon detection of chronic impurity.",
    "Assign Purification Mentor to guide completion of ritual process until self-sustained purity is achieved.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Monitoring Grid to ensure sincerity of intent during ablution cycles.",
    "Activate Community Reintegration Loop once biomarkers confirm return to pranic equilibrium.",
    "Log Restoration Event in Dharma Compliance Ledger for future reference in integrity assessments."

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness through purification protocols. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
