  "transliteration": "chhāyā svo dāsavargaśca duhitā kṛpaṇaṃ param |\ntasmādetairadhikṣiptaḥ sahetāsañjvaraḥ sadā || 4.185||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is constantly afflicted by shadow, servants, groups of dependents, daughters, and the destitute shall remain ever feverish in body and consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from sustained alignment with conscious responsibility",
    "Causation flows through relational entanglement and energetic dependency",
    "Capacity-based responsibility expands with proximity to dependent consciousness",
    "Restoration logic requires detachment from parasitic relational structures",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates transcendence of possessive identity-bindings"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits persistent relational dependency on shadow-forms, servant classes, or dependent identities, THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocols",
    "IF individual demonstrates inability to sustain energetic independence due to familial or social attachments, THEN deploy capacity-restoration mechanisms",
    "IF consciousness shows signs of chronic feverishness due to external dependencies, THEN activate detachment-induction sequences",
    "IF agent remains bound to possessive constructs of ownership over others, THEN enforce completion processes until integrity is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes that those whose consciousness remains enmeshed in dependent relationships—whether familial, servile, or possessive—are unfit for authoritative roles. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrating freedom from relational fever. Authority hierarchies must reflect individuals free from such bindings, ensuring decisions arise from clarity rather than entangled desire.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that feverishness originates from misplaced identification with dependent forms. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how clinging to shadow, servants, or daughters distorts inner equilibrium. Responsibility aligns proportionally with one's capacity to disengage from these bonds. Nyāya operates not through punishment but through the natural consequence of misalignment: continued unrest until restoration occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Shadow-Detachment Completion Process to sever illusory identifications",
    "Deploy Servant-Class Consciousness Reintegration Protocol to dissolve hierarchical distortion",
    "Activate Daughter-Bond Purification Sequence to restore non-possessive relational integrity",
    "Implement Destitution-Empowerment Circuit to uplift both giver and receiver consciousness",
    "Enforce Fever-Dissolution Alignment Practice to restore bio-conscious harmony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores consciousness from relational fever through non-punitive realignment. Reality acknowledges no punishment; only the self-correcting mechanism of Dharma. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
