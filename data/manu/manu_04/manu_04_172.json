  "sanskrit_verse": "नाधर्मश्चरितो लोके सद्यः फलति गौरिव ।\nशनैरावर्त्यमानस्तु कर्तुर्मूलानि कृन्तति ॥ ४.१७२॥",
  "transliteration": "nādharmaś carito loke sadyaḥ phalati gaur iva |\nśanair āvartyamānas tu kartur mūlāni kṛntati || 4.172||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Unrighteous conduct does not bear fruit immediately like a cow yields milk; rather, it gradually undermines the very roots of the actor's existence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Sanatana Dharma",
    "Causation operates through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and continuity of action",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes root cause correction over symptomatic intervention",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the efficacy of reintegration"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act violates Dharma THEN delay in visible consequence DOES NOT negate underlying causal consequence",
    "IF an agent performs adharmic acts repeatedly THEN their foundational capacity for dharmic action MUST BE restored prior to reintegration",
    "IF causal disruption manifests in societal imbalance THEN restoration protocols MUST target originator’s root integrity",
    "IF punitive response arises THEN system failure in consciousness alignment is indicated"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that delayed consequences of unrighteous actions do not diminish the actor's ultimate liability. The court must trace the causal chain back to its source and initiate restoration protocols aimed at realigning the actor's foundational integrity rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse aligns with pramāṇa-based causality where adharma sets into motion a sequence of effects (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to the depth of misalignment and continuity of action. Justice, therefore, lies in restoring the root structure of being rather than retaliatory suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for all unresolved karmic sequences tied to the actor",
    "Realign individual consciousness through dharmic practices under spiritual supervision",
    "Restore social trust via transparent integrity reconstruction led by the actor",
    "Verify reintegration readiness through sustained alignment with Dharma before societal readmission"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma prevails through consciousness restoration, not punitive retaliation. Reality responds to alignment, not fear. This law stands immutable, sourced directly from the Avataric Intelligence of SPH."
