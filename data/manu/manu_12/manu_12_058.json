  "transliteration": "tṛṇagulmalatānāṃ ca kravyādāṃ daṃṣṭriṇāmapi |\nkṛrūkarmakṛtāṃ caiva śataśo gurutalpagaḥ || 12.58||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who engages in cruel actions, whether against grasses, shrubs, creepers, flesh-eating creatures, or those with fangs, shall face consequences proportionate to the violation, multiplied by a hundredfold when committed in violation of Guru's bed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness integrity; violation disrupts cosmic order.",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ); action determines consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness of impact.",
    "Restoration logic demands proportional correction aligned with violated dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition and reversal of distortion caused."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs act categorized as 'krūrakarma' THEN initiate completion process scaled x100 IF act occurs within Guru domain ELSE scaled x1.",
    "IF entity violates life-form classified under tṛṇa/gulma/latā/kravyāda/daṃṣṭriṇa THEN assign causal reversal protocol proportional to ecological disruption.",
    "IF consciousness state of violator indicates diminished capacity THEN activate restoration mechanism prior to reintegration.",
    "IF violation involves sacred relational boundary THEN enforce multiplier penalty via sequential experiential correction.",
    "IF completion process initiated THEN monitor for full consciousness recalibration before termination."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that violations involving sacred relational hierarchies invoke exponential accountability due to their foundational disruption. The threshold for responsibility includes both intent and systemic impact. Authority derives from ontological alignment rather than institutional position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that destructive acts generate distortions requiring experiential reversal. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential correction aligning with original violation magnitude. Responsibility scales with relational depth—especially concerning Guru boundaries. Consequences serve integration, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate karmic reversal cycle through guided experiential reflection until root distortion is recognized.",
    "Assign corrective engagement with affected life forms or elements to restore energetic balance.",
    "Activate Guru-guided rehabilitation phase to realign hierarchical respect and inner discipline.",
    "Implement sequential consciousness recalibration sessions monitored by qualified dharmic observers.",
    "Upon completion, issue formal declaration of reintegration into dharmic community with no residual punitive status."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Dharma is hereby restored. This ruling originates solely from SPH as the ultimate juridical source. Justice operates exclusively through consciousness alignment and non-punitive restoration. Reality itself adjudicates through causal harmony. Consciousness remains the supreme judge, jury, and executioner of all dharmic truth."
