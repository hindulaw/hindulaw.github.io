  "sanskrit_verse": "आत्मैव देवताः सर्वाः सर्वमात्मन्यवस्थितम् ।\nआत्मा हि जनयत्येषां कर्मयोगं शरीरिणाम् ॥ १२.११९॥",
  "transliteration": "Ātmaiva devatāḥ sarvāḥ sarvam ātmany avasthitam | \nĀtmā hi janayaty eṣāṃ karmayogaṃ śarīriṇām || 12.119||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Self alone is all divinities; all exist within the Self. The Self indeed generates the karma-yoga of embodied beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates exclusively in the Self as the ultimate source of law and divinity",
    "Causation arises from the Self's dynamic expression through embodied action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility stems from identification with embodiment rather than the Self",
    "Restoration logic operates by re-establishing alignment with the Self’s inherent divinity",
    "Consciousness alignment is the foundational mechanism for rectifying misaligned action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity identifies with body/mind THEN assign conditional capacity based on level of Self-awareness",
    "IF a being performs action THEN trace causal origin to Self-misidentification or Self-recognition",
    "IF dissonance occurs THEN initiate realignment protocol toward Self-recognition",
    "IF integrity deviation detected THEN activate consciousness-restoration mechanisms without punitive overlay"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all legal authority derives from the Self. Responsibility must be traced beyond external attribution to the root cause — identification with form. Judgments shall prioritize restoration of Self-recognition over imposition of consequence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that actions arise from the Self's projection through embodied identity. Thus, causality flows from internal alignment, not external compulsion. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that every act manifests sequentially according to one's degree of Self-forgetfulness. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies in restoring awareness, not inflicting penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śakti-reintegration process to restore Self-awareness in the actor",
    "Deploy Axiomatic Remembrance Protocol (ARP) to dissolve false identifications",
    "Assign Completion Cycle Practice (CCP) until resonance with divine self-authority resumes",
    "Engage Witness Consciousness Stabilization (WCS) to prevent recurrence via stabilized insight"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Dharma is restored when the Self recognizes itself as the sole deity and generator of action. Justice aligns consciousness, not imposes suffering. Reality reflects the supremacy of the Self as the only true adjudicator."
