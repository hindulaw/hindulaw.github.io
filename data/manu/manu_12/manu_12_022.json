  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Upon experiencing those sufferings, the embodied soul, now purified of all impurities, again enters, in due proportion, into the very five elements.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from experiential purification, not punitive judgment",
    "Causation is sequential and karmically deterministic, not morally assigned",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises post-consciousness purification",
    "Restoration logic aligns with elemental reintegration, not societal exclusion",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through experiential completion, not external correction"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity undergoes full experiential consequence THEN purification status = true",
    "IF purification_status = true THEN eligibility for elemental reintegration = granted",
    "IF elemental_reintegration_granted THEN societal restoration protocols activate",
    "IF consciousness_state >= purified THEN punitive measures = null",
    "IF action_causality_traceable_to_karma THEN judicial intervention = observational_only"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the threshold of responsibility lies not in moral culpability but in the completion of karmic experience. Authority to judge resides only where consciousness has been fully purified and realigned with its elemental origin. Cases must be resolved by assessing experiential completeness rather than assigning fault.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that suffering is a natural outcome of prior action, not a judicially imposed penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation without punitive intent. Proportional responsibility corresponds exactly to the degree of elemental fragmentation previously caused. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that all consequences are self-administered through conscious evolution.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through experiential purification and elemental reintegration; justice flows from consciousness, not punishment; reality itself adjudicates through karmic sequence; the ultimate judge is the awakened Self."
