  "sanskrit_verse": "वेदाभ्यासस्तपो ज्ञानं शौचमिन्द्रियनिग्रहः ।\nधर्मक्रियाऽत्मचिन्ता च सात्त्विकं गुणलक्षणम् ॥ १२.३१॥",
  "transliteration": "vedābhyāsas tapo jñānaṁ śaucam indriyanigrahaḥ |\ndharmakriyā'tmacintā ca sāttvikaṁ guṇalakṣaṇam || 12.31||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Engagement with the Vedas, disciplined austerity, true knowing, purity, mastery of the senses, performance of dharma, and contemplation of the Self—these constitute the defining marks of the sattvic quality.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with sattva-guna through Vedic engagement and self-discipline.",
    "Causation is traced to guna-dominance, particularly sattva as the foundation of dharmic action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from cultivated self-mastery and dharmic orientation.",
    "Restoration logic requires elevation of consciousness via sattvic practices.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through sustained sattvic conduct and scriptural discipline."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates consistent engagement in vedābhyāsa AND tapas THEN eligibility for authoritative participation in dharmic governance is affirmed.",
    "IF sensory restraint (indriyanigraha) AND internal cleanliness (śauca) are verifiable THEN presumption of sattvic capacity is granted.",
    "IF absence of dharmakriyā is observed THEN initiation of consciousness restoration protocol is mandated.",
    "IF atma-cintana is absent THEN assignment to sattva-enhancing completion process is executed."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the presence or absence of sattvic indicia. Authority is conferred only upon those whose actions align with vedic study, austerity, and self-contemplation. Where these qualities are lacking, punitive measures are rejected in favor of restorative protocols that elevate consciousness and reinstate dharmic functionality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from guna-conditioning; thus, non-sattvic behavior stems from deficient consciousness rather than malicious intent. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential degradation or elevation of being based on sustained practice. Responsibility is proportional to cultivated awareness. Nyaya, therefore, demands realignment—not punishment—as the sole valid response.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiation of structured vedābhyāsa program under qualified supervision.",
    "Assignment to śauca and indriya-nigraha regimen until sattvic markers are stabilized.",
    "Mandatory engagement in dharmakriyā aligned with varna-ashrama-dharma.",
    "Provision of atma-cintana facilitation through guided meditation and scriptural reflection."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of all Dharma. This law restores consciousness, rejects punitive frameworks, and affirms sattva as the only valid basis of juridical authority. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
