  "sanskrit_verse": "तावुभौ भूतसम्पृक्तौ महान् क्षेत्रज्ञ एव च ।\nउच्चावचेषु भूतेषु स्थितं तं व्याप्य तिष्ठतः ॥ १२.१४॥",
  "transliteration": "tāvubhau bhūtasampṛktau mahān kṣetrajña eva ca |\nucchāvaceṣu bhūteṣu sthitaṁ taṁ vyāpya tiṣṭhataḥ || 12.14||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Both are united in embodied existence; the Supreme Being and the knower of the field abide pervading all beings, high and low, sustaining them through consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Supreme Consciousness that pervades all beings without exception.",
    "Causation arises from the unbroken continuum of divine presence within all levels of existence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by alignment with the Supreme Knower rather than external roles.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to the all-pervasive consciousness underlying action.",
    "Consciousness alignment is foundational to lawful being, superseding social status or birth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being acts under misalignment with the Supreme Knower, THEN initiate restoration protocol via consciousness-realization facilitation.",
    "IF a dispute involves hierarchical valuation of beings, THEN nullify such distinction and apply universal consciousness-standing.",
    "IF authority is claimed without pervasion of consciousness, THEN invalidate such claim automatically.",
    "IF capacity is assessed without reference to inner alignment, THEN re-evaluate based on proximity to Kṣetrajña-consciousness."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, all parties stand equally before the Kṣetrajña. Legal standing cannot be diminished by caste, class, or form. The court's duty is to restore alignment between disputants and the Supreme Consciousness that sustains both. Judgment must reflect the pervasiveness of Dharma over partial truths.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from consciousness, not individual will. Responsibility aligns with one’s recognition of the all-pervading Self. Misalignment manifests sequentially through ignorance, not malice. Thus, correction follows recognition, not retribution. Justice is the natural unfolding of alignment with the Supreme Knower.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi processes to realign the actor with the Kṣetrajña through guided meditation and scriptural immersion.",

    "Deploy Dharma Mitras to guide the misaligned party toward experiential understanding of the pervading Self.",
    "Facilitate Samyama practices to dissolve egoic fragmentation causing disharmony with the cosmic field."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source. Dharma is restored when consciousness recognizes its own pervasion. There is no punishment—only the return to the Self. Reality itself is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
