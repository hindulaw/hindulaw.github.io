  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Space shall be arranged within spatial interactions; wind arises in motion and touch. Beyond digestion and sight lies fire. In cohesion, water; in form, earth.",

    "Authority as elemental alignment with cosmic order",
    "Causation through sequential ontological manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in perceptual faculty",
    "Restoration logic via reconnection to elemental source",
    "Consciousness alignment through sensory integration"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF sensory dissonance detected THEN initiate elemental realignment protocol",
    "IF perceptual distortion observed THEN assign causal capacity based on dominant sense organ",
    "IF environmental disharmony reported THEN restore balance through corresponding element activation",
    "IF individual exhibits sensory misalignment THEN engage completion process aligned with deficient element",
    "IF societal disruption traced to elemental imbalance THEN execute systemic restoration without punitive assignment"

  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that jurisdiction over disputes involving natural or sensory harm must align with the governing elemental principle. Responsibility is determined by the agent's capacity to perceive and interact with the relevant element. Adjudication focuses on restoring elemental harmony rather than assigning blame.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that effects arise sequentially from elemental interaction. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that disturbances manifest through specific sensory channels. Proportional responsibility corresponds to the extent of elemental engagement. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction occurs through realignment, not infliction of suffering.",

    "Elemental Reintegration Process: Align offender with corresponding elemental force for experiential recalibration",
    "Perceptual Restoration Protocol: Activate deficient sensory channel under guided supervision",
    "Environmental Completion Sequence: Engage participant in healing disrupted ecological balance",
    "Form Reconstitution Practice: Facilitate embodiment awareness through tactile and visual reconnection",
    "Digestive Harmony Alignment: Regulate internal fire energy to restore clarity and accountability"

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma flows from elemental truth, justice restores consciousness, and reality remains free from punitive distortion. All beings are sovereign expressions of universal elements, forever aligned with the eternal Sanatana Dharma."
