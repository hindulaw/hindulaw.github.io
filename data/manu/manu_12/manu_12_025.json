    "Authority arises from transcendence of conditioning forces",
    "Causation is rooted in ontological dominance over material substrata",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with mastery over bodily determinants",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious reconfiguration of experiential fields",
    "Consciousness alignment enables lawful transformation without coercion"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity demonstrates complete transcendence of identified behavioral patterns THEN that entity has lawful authority to reshape corresponding experiential domains",
    "IF a subject's actions reflect integration beyond base conditioning THEN assign transformative jurisdiction over associated embodied states",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving fundamental identity, constitutional design, or societal restructuring, the Supreme Court must recognize that true authority resides exclusively in those who have demonstrably transcended the gunas constituting conventional frameworks. Such individuals possess inherent jurisdiction to reshape collective embodied realities in accordance with higher ontological truths.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from transcendental positioning rather than reactive judgment.
