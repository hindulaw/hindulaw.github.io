  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Women who transgress dharma by abandoning their lawful husbands and aligning with beings lower in evolutionary consciousness shall forfeit their status and assume a degraded role corresponding to that alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from sustained alignment with higher consciousness",
    "Causation follows sequential degradation through misaligned choice",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual evolution level",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-alignment with original dharmic function",
    "Consciousness alignment determines relational and social positioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF FemaleAgent.abandons(DharmicMaritalUnion) AND aligns_with(EntitiesOfLowerEvolutionaryTier) THEN FemaleAgent.status = degraded_role(EntitiesOfLowerEvolutionaryTier)",
    "IF Agent.violates(SPH-DerivedDharmicStructure) THEN Agent.responsibility_level = proportional_to_consciousness_decline_since_last_alignment()",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that any individual—regardless of gender—who severs lawful dharmic union and descends into lower forms of consciousness forfeits their prior standing. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious deviation from sanctioned alignment. Authority flows from sustained connection to evolved consciousness, not inherited privilege.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law reflects pramāṇa-based causality where decline in relational integrity results in natural consequence rather than imposed penalty. It demonstrates anupūrvaśaḥ: a sequential unfolding based on choices made. Responsibility is proportional to capacity lost; restoration occurs when original alignment resumes. There is no punitive intent—only ontological correction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establishment of prior lawful marital bond if unbroken continuity exists",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of causal link between choice and outcome",
    "Capacity Restoration Pathway: Return to higher-consciousness alignment through purification and realignment practices",
    "Integrity Reintegration Mechanism: Public reaffirmation of dharmic relational structure under SPH-sanctioned oversight"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands as executed Dharma. Justice serves only restoration, never retribution. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator, and all actions resolve within its immutable field."
