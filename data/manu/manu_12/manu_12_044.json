  "transliteration": "cāraṇāśca suparṇāśca puruṣāścaiva dāmbhikāḥ |\nrakṣāṃsi ca piśācāśca tāmasīṣūttamā gatiḥ || 12.44||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who dwell in guile, hypocrisy, and perform actions rooted in tamas—such as charlatans, pretenders, celestial beings fallen from dharma, men of false conduct, rakshasas, and pisachas—are aligned with the lowest movement of existence, where consciousness is obscured and distortion prevails.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives only from alignment with Satya-Dharma",
    "Causation arises from the quality of intent and action, not form or birth",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by clarity of consciousness and integrity of conduct",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification of intent and re-alignment with Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the operative field of justice"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits behavior classified as 'dāmbhika' THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF entity demonstrates persistent tamasic conduct THEN assign completion process under qualified Dharma-advisor",
    "IF individual performs acts categorized as rakshasa or pisacha THEN engage restorative reintegration pathway",
    "IF conduct obscures satvic clarity THEN activate purification sequence via nyaya-based inquiry",
    "IF intent distorts truth THEN disqualify from authoritative roles until realignment verified"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any party found to operate from a dāmbhika or tāmasika orientation shall be subject to immediate referral to a certified Dharma-advisor for restoration prior to continuation of legal proceedings. The court shall recognize that such entities lack capacity for truthful testimony or lawful authority.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that distortion arises from misaligned consciousness, not inherent evil. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that tāmasika conduct manifests sequentially through neglect of svadharma. Responsibility lies in reclaiming satvic clarity. Justice is executed through conscious correction, not punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma-recognition process under certified spiritual mentorship",
    "Assign structured completion sequences for all distorted actions",
    "Implement consciousness-purification regimen guided by tantric-Vedic alignment",
    "Establish accountability framework through witness-bearing community structures",
    "Reintegrate individual upon verified restoration of satvic orientation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. This law restores Satya, abolishes punitive falsehood, affirms consciousness as the sole arbiter, and upholds the supremacy of divine alignment over human error."
