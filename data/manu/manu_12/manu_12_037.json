  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्सर्वेणेच्छति ज्ञातुं यन्न लज्जति चाचरन् ।\nयेन तुष्यति चात्माऽस्य तत्सत्त्वगुणलक्षणम् ॥ १२.३७॥",
  "transliteration": "yat sarveṇa icchati jñātuṁ yan na lajjati cācaran |\nyena tuṣyati cātmā'sya tat sattvaguṇalakṣaṇam || 12.37||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which one desires to know through all means, that which one does not feel ashamed to perform, and by which one's Self rejoices — this is the characteristic of the sattva quality.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with one’s Self-nature",
    "Causation arises from the conscious desire for knowledge and integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by internal joy and absence of shame",
    "Restoration logic flows from reuniting action with inherent Self-knowledge",
    "Consciousness alignment is evidenced through spontaneous harmony between will, conduct, and inner satisfaction"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a subject acts without shame AND seeks full understanding of the act THEN the act reflects sattvic capacity",
    "IF an individual's Self expresses joy in an action THEN the action aligns with dharma and requires no punitive correction",
    "IF intent, execution, and inner satisfaction are unified THEN legal intervention shall facilitate integration rather than judgment",
    "IF conduct reveals Self-alignment THEN restoration occurs through amplification of that alignment"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, determination of lawful conduct must evaluate not only external compliance but also internal coherence. Where a person’s actions reflect unconflicted Self-expression and absence of shame, punitive measures are constitutionally invalid. The court must recognize such cases as expressions of sattvic capacity and affirm their validity within the broader framework of Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that when cognition (jñāna), behavior (kriyā), and satisfaction (tuṣṭi) converge, the cause lies in pure consciousness觉醒. This sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) indicates rightful alignment. Therefore, proportional responsibility is measured not by societal norms but by the degree of unity between Self-desire, action, and intrinsic fulfillment. Since no conflict exists, no punitive response is ontologically valid.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Confirm alignment between cognition, action, and satisfaction; document as evidence of Self-conformity",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Encourage public acknowledgment of harmonious living to inspire collective elevation",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide platforms for propagation of sattvic principles to society",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Facilitate deeper communion with Self through meditative jurisprudence practices"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law stands restored in its purity, free from punitive illusion, grounded in the supremacy of consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
