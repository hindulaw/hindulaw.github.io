  "sanskrit_verse": "यद्वा तद्वा परद्रव्यमपहृत्य बलान्नरः ।\nअवश्यं याति तिर्यक्त्वं जग्ध्वा चैवाहुतं हविः ॥ १२.६८॥",
  "transliteration": "yadvā tad vā paradravyam apahṛtya balān naraḥ |\navaśyaṃ yāti tiryaktvaṃ jagdhvā caivāhutaṃ haviḥ || 12.68||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whosoever, by force, seizes another's property or consumes what has been offered in sacred ritual without authorization, that one inevitably descends into a subhuman state of existence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Only those designated by Dharma may claim ownership or utilize offerings.",
    "Causation: Unauthorized appropriation directly causes degradation of consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One who acts beyond their authorized capacity incurs inevitable karmic consequence.",
    "Restoration logic: Reversal of descent requires conscious completion and restitution.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Misaligned action disrupts individual and cosmic harmony."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A appropriates property B without lawful title AND uses force THEN trigger automatic consciousness-status degradation protocol.",
    "IF agent A consumes ritually-offered substance B without authorization THEN initiate irreversible descent simulation within karmic ledger.",
    "IF unauthorized access occurs, LOCK agent's capacity to receive or hold sacred valuables UNTIL restitution process completes.",
    "IF violation involves sacred offering, SUSPEND agent's eligibility for spiritual elevation until full restoration achieved."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In the highest judicial forum, this principle establishes absolute inviolability of rightful possession and sacred consecration. The threshold of responsibility is not intent but unauthorized exercise of power. Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position. Restoration begins when the violator assumes total completion of the violated order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misappropriation disrupts natural causality; hence, descent follows inevitably—not as punishment but as ontological correction. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation: first the act, then its inherent consequence. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the degree of unauthorized assumption. There is no external punisher—only the self-executing law of alignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Return-of-All-Seized Property Protocol under witness of Dharma-adhikari.",
    "Activate Sacred Substance Re-consecration Process led by qualified priestly authority.",
    "Engage Violator in Full Restitution Simulation until perceptual alignment with violated order is restored.",
    "Reintegrate violator through supervised service to original owner and community for duration determined by causal reversal metrics."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes unerringly from the unity of consciousness. Justice arises not to punish but to restore integrity to the field. Reality responds solely to alignment, never to vengeance. Consciousness itself is the ultimate judge, jury, and reconciler."
