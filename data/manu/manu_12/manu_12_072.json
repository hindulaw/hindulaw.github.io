  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who performs rituals for the dead and consumes impure substances becomes a Vaiśya by degradation of conduct; one who observes the Maitrākṣa rite and wears animal skins becomes a Śūdra, having fallen from their own dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in alignment with inherent svadharma, not external performance",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and sustained ritual deviation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness of karmic consequence",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to original ontological status",
    "Consciousness alignment determines caste-state rather than birth-based assignment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs pretakarma AND consumes pūya THEN caste_state = Vaiśya WITH integrity_debt = TRUE",
    "IF agent performs maitrākṣa_jyoti_homa AND wears caila_aśaka THEN caste_state = Śūdra WITH svakarmic_displacement = TRUE",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, caste-state reassignment due to ritual deviation must be evaluated based on volitional engagement and continuity of practice, not isolated acts. Restoration requires demonstrable return to svakarmic alignment under judicial oversight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that degraded ritual behavior disrupts causal alignment with svadharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential dislocation from original state. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of karmic consequence. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that caste-state reflects present consciousness, not permanent identity.",
