  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By which quality one enters into these cycles of existence, that quality shall determine their experiential continuum; accordingly, the sequential manifestation of those qualities shall be declared in summary.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the governing quality (guṇa) determining experiential reality",
    "Causation follows the dominant guṇa shaping consciousness and action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the individual's dominant guṇic influence",
    "Restoration logic aligns with the sequential purification of guṇas",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition and transcendence of binding guṇas"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being manifests actions dominated by a specific guṇa THEN assign experiential consequences aligned with that guṇa until recognition arises",
    "WHEN a being recognizes the causal guṇa THEN initiate restoration protocol through guṇa-transcendence mechanisms",
    "IF multiple guṇas are active THEN prioritize the dominant guṇa for sequencing restoration protocols",
    "WHEN integrity is restored THEN dissolve karmic imprints associated with the identified guṇa pattern"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the dominant guṇa influencing the act. The hierarchy of authority reflects the clarity of consciousness recognizing guṇic influence. Justice is executed through restoration of guṇic balance rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that experiential outcomes arise from guṇic dominance. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation aligns with karmic-guṇic causality. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of guṇic identification. Non-punitive reality is upheld as outcomes serve recognition, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guṇa-recognition completion process to dissolve binding patterns",
    "Assign experiential learning aligned with the dominant guṇa until self-awareness arises",
    "Restore capacity through guṇa-transcendence practices guided by realized consciousness",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Guṇic causality governs experiential reality. Restoration supersedes punishment. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored."
