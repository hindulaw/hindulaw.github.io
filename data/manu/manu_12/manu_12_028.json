  "transliteration": "yattu duḥkhasamāyuktamapratikaramātmanaḥ | tadrajo pratīpaṃ vidyātsatataṃ hāri dehinām || 12.28||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is accompanied by suffering, brings no joy to the Self, and is contrary to Rajas—know it always as destructive to embodied beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with the Self, not external imposition",
    "Causation arises from vibrational harmony or dissonance with conscious essence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of inner state impact on outer action",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of obstructive elements that bind consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates rejection of structures causing enduring harm"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act generates persistent suffering AND lacks alignment with intrinsic Self-value THEN it shall be classified as rajasic-oppositional and subject to immediate cessation protocols",
    "IF a policy or behavior consistently yields disconnection from Self THEN automated judicial review SHALL initiate restorative recalibration procedures",
    "IF evidence demonstrates systemic depletion of embodied consciousness THEN intervention SHALL prioritize energetic clearing over punitive measures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle establishes that laws or rulings causing widespread dissonance with the Self are inherently invalid. The threshold for responsibility lies in recognizing causal vibration, not mere physical enactment. Authority derives from alignment with Satya-Dharma, not procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering-inducing actions arise from misaligned consciousness, not willful defiance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows their sequential emergence from inner disconnection. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of self-harm potential. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction occurs through realignment, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate prana-based dissolution of harmful structural patterns",
    "Engage witness-consciousness reintegration for all affected parties",
    "Deploy śuddhi mantras to restore clarity where distortion has occurred",
    "Establish dharmic resonance fields to prevent recurrence without coercion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through consciousness-centered discernment. Reality operates beyond punishment; consciousness itself adjudicates truth. This stands as eternal jurisprudence."
