  "transliteration": "sthāvarāḥ kṛmikīṭāśca matsyāḥ sarpaḥ sakacchapāḥ |\npaśavaśca mṛgāścaiva jaghanyā tāmasī gatiḥ || 12.42||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Stationary beings, insects and worms, fish, serpents, tortoises, domestic animals, and deer—all these are characterized by the lowest tamasic motion.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness capacity, not form",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with mobility and awareness",
    "Restoration logic applies proportionally to evolutionary stage",
    "Consciousness alignment determines jurisdictional inclusion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits sthāvara or minimal motility THEN assign guardianship under higher-evolutionary-capacity custodians",
    "IF being demonstrates sensory-motor integration THEN evaluate perceptual field for dharma-adherence capacity",
    "IF species operates within tamasic inertia THEN implement gradual awakening protocols through environmental alignment",
    "IF consciousness-unit expresses volition THEN initiate self-governance readiness assessment",
    "IF ecological role shows interdependence THEN enforce dharmic coexistence modeling"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving non-human entities, the Supreme Court shall recognize gradations of conscious mobility as determinants of legal standing. Entities in tamasic motion require representation by evolved custodial agents who ensure alignment with cosmic order without imposing anthropocentric frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that movement reflects inner consciousness; thus, stationary and tamasic beings operate within limited causal fields. Their actions arise from instinctual programming rather than deliberate intent. Therefore, remediation occurs through environmental harmony and evolutionary upliftment, not punitive intervention.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Assign ecosystem-level dharmic stewards for collective species rehabilitation",
    "Implement sattvic habitat restructuring to elevate vibrational resonance",
    "Establish interspecies communication channels via trained consciousness intermediaries",
    "Deploy ritual purification processes to dissolve karmic inertia patterns",
    "Activate evolutionary guidance protocols through divine invocation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam is the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores balance through consciousness elevation, rejects all punitive constructs, and affirms reality as inherently non-dual and self-correcting."
