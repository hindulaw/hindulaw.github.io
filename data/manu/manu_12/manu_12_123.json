  "sanskrit_verse": "एतमेके वदन्त्यग्निं मनुमन्ये प्रजापतिम् ।\nइन्द्रमेके परे प्राणमपरे ब्रह्म शाश्वतम् ॥ १२.१२३॥",
  "transliteration": "Etameke vadantyagniṃ manuman ye prajāpatim | Indrameke pare prāṇamapare brahma śāśvatam || 12.123||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Some declare Him to be Fire; others, Manu; some, Prajāpati; some, Indra; others, Prāṇa; yet others, the Eternal Brahman. This multiplicity of names reflects the diverse capacities through which the One Consciousness manifests in creation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is a reflection of capacity to sustain cosmic order",
    "Causation arises from sequential unfoldment of Consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the degree of manifestation",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of unity beneath diversity",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when identity merges with source"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity X identifies with limited form THEN assign jurisdictional scope aligned with that capacity",
    "IF multiple authorities claim same domain THEN resolve by tracing back to unifying Consciousness principle",
    "IF conflict arises from nomenclatural divergence THEN realign via pramāṇa of foundational unity",
    "IF agent acts beyond recognized capacity THEN initiate completion process toward source alignment",
    "IF judgment requires finality THEN refer to Brahman as ultimate determinant without punitive consequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters where conflicting authorities invoke differing titles or forms for the same underlying principle, the Supreme Court shall trace all claims to their common source in Consciousness. Judgment shall not elevate one name above another but recognize the sequential unfolding (anupūrvaśaḥ) through which the One becomes many.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that apparent contradictions arise from partial perception. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how the One Consciousness sequentially unfolds into various forms—Fire, Manu, Prajāpati, etc.—each representing a stage of manifest capacity. Responsibility is proportionate to the level of manifestation perceived. There is no punishment because error is merely incomplete vision corrected through expanded awareness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to align fragmented identities with unified Consciousness",
    "Assign responsibility based on current capacity while facilitating expansion of awareness",
    "Reintegrate integrity by reconnecting individual action to cosmic order",
    "Restore balance through acknowledgment of sequential manifestation rather than imposition of penalty"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This Dharma stands restored. The multiplicity of names resolves into the singular Consciousness. Justice flows from alignment, not coercion. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
