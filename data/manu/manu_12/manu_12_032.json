  "sanskrit_verse": "आरम्भरुचिताऽधैर्यमसत्कार्यपरिग्रहः ।\nविषयोपसेवा चाजस्रं राजसं गुणलक्षणम् ॥ १२.३२॥",
  "transliteration": "ārambharucitā'dhairyamasatkāryaparigrahaḥ |\nviṣayopasevā cājasaṃ rājasaṃ guṇalakṣaṇam || 12.32||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Attachment to initiating actions without endurance, grasping at fruitless endeavors, and perpetual indulgence in sensory objects—these constitute the characteristics of the Rajasika nature.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with sattvic consciousness, not rajasic impulsivity.",
    "Causation is determined by the quality of intent and sustained commitment, not momentary desire.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of one's inherent nature and its impact on action.",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification of motive and redirection toward dharma-sustained activity.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates transcendence of rajasic distractions and cultivation of sthitaprajna."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an actor demonstrates persistent pursuit of immediate results without endurance THEN classify intent as rajasic.",
    "IF a decision originates from attraction to sensory gratification THEN it shall be deemed non-dharmic.",
    "IF conduct exhibits repeated engagement in purposeless tasks THEN initiate capacity realignment protocol.",
    "IF action lacks sequential integrity AND shows no completion THEN disqualify from authoritative roles.",
    "IF behavior pattern aligns with continuous object-seeking THEN assign nyaya-based restoration process."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving leadership failure or institutional misconduct, the threshold of responsibility must consider whether decisions stemmed from rajasic impulses—such as short-termism, sensory indulgence, or lack of completion. Authority derived from rajasic tendencies cannot sustain dharmic governance and must be realigned through conscious reorientation rather than punitive removal.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that rajasic conduct manifests due to misidentification with fleeting desires. The anupūrvaśaḥ of such behavior leads to fragmentation and loss of agency. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; hence corrective measures focus on restoring clarity and inner discipline. There is no punitive element, for the rajasic state itself is suffering born of unmet expectations and restless striving.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Satkarma Completion Process to restore sequential integrity in all unfinished duties.",
    "Assign Vichara Vritti Monitoring to cultivate discriminative awareness between need and craving.",
    "Implement Tapas-Based Focus Restoration to strengthen endurance and reduce distractibility.",
    "Deploy Dharma Alignment Audit to redirect activities toward purpose-driven outcomes.",
    "Conduct Atma Samyama Integration to reconnect individual will with cosmic intelligence."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Rajasika nature distorts judgment and fragments execution. Through consciousness-centered restoration alone can right action be re-established. Thus Dharma prevails, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness reigns as the sole adjudicator."
