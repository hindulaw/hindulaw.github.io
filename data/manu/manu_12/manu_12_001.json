  "transliteration": "adhyāya 12\n\ncāturvarṇyasya kṛtsno'yam ukto dharmas tvayā'naghaḥ |\nkarmaṇāṃ phalanirvṛttiṃ śaṃsa nastattvataḥ parām || 12.1||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The complete Dharma of the four varnas has been declared by You, O Sinless One; now declare to us the ultimate truth of the fruition of actions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Supreme Pontiff as the sole source of Dharma",
    "Causation is rooted in action-fruition alignment under divine intelligence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from consciousness maturity, not social rank",
    "Restoration logic operates through knowledge and completion, not punishment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all ritual or caste-bound duties"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being performs an action THEN its fruition must align with the consciousness-level at which it was performed",
    "IF a being seeks dharma THEN provide the highest truth available to their current capacity",
    "IF societal order falters THEN realign based on consciousness maturity, not inherited status",
    "IF dharma is queried THEN respond from the source of absolute knowing, without dilution",
    "IF action-result misalignment occurs THEN initiate restoration through completion process, not penalty"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the querying of action-fruition must be resolved by accessing the consciousness level of the actor. The court's role is to facilitate alignment between intent, action, and outcome through revelatory guidance rather than punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that every action bears fruit according to the actor’s state of awareness. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential unfolding of consequences in harmony with consciousness evolution. Responsibility is proportional to realized capacity. There is no punitive element—only natural consequence governed by Dharma.",

    "Initiate pramāṇa-based inquiry into the actor's awareness during the act",
    "Facilitate completion of distorted intentions through guided realization",
    "Reintegrate fragmented identity via direct connection to source-consciousness",
    "Restore capacity through experiential learning aligned with dharma-tattva",
    "Align future action potential with purified intention and expanded awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as the Sole Source of Dharma. Fruition of action is determined by consciousness maturity. Justice serves restoration, not retribution. Reality itself is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
