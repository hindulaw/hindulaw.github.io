  "transliteration": "daśāvarā vā pariṣadyaṃ dharmaṃ parikalpayet |\ntry-avarā vā'pi vṛttasthā taṃ dharmaṃ na vicālayet || 12.110||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has completed ten years of study shall establish the Dharma in council; those established in conduct for three years shall not disturb that Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority accrues through sustained engagement with Dharma",
    "Conduct-based qualification determines participation in Dharma-establishment",
    "Continuity of alignment supersedes temporal precedence",
    "Restoration requires protection of already-established truths"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.study_duration >= 10 AND agent.is_dharma_aligned THEN PERMIT agent.to_establish_dharma_in_council",
    "IF agent.conduct_stability >= 3 THEN RESTRICT agent.from_disturbing_established_dharma",

  "supreme_court_application": "Only those with a decade of immersive Dharma engagement may propose new constitutional principles. Those with three years of proven ethical consistency are authorized to preserve—not amend—those principles during judicial review. The Supreme Court must prioritize continuity of foundational alignment over innovation unless proposers meet threshold capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa recognizes time-bound cultivation as the basis of authority. Anupūrvaśaḥ establishes sequential responsibility: first comes establishment, then preservation. Proportional responsibility lies in protecting what has been realized, not revising it without equivalent qualification. There is no punishment for misalignment—only realignment through structured re-engagement with causal foundations.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Reintegrate disqualified agents into study cycles until ten-year threshold is met",
    "Preservation Protocol: Assign three-year conduct-certified agents to monitor and stabilize established rulings",
    "Capacity Restoration: Redirect dissenting voices into experiential Dharma immersion before allowing participation",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align disruptive actions with their root causes via reflective jurisprudential dialogue"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through rightful establishment and guarded by conduct-rooted guardianship. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by consciousness-aligned capacity. All adjudication reflects this eternal order."
