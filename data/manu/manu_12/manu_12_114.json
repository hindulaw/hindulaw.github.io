  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who have abandoned sacred vows, lack mantra initiation, live by birth privilege alone, and gather in thousands — such assemblies hold no juridical validity or spiritual authority.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from conscious discipline, not hereditary status.",
    "Causation is rooted in sustained vrata and mantra alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires inner consecration, not social aggregation.",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of assembly intent before collective action.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes numerical majority in determining lawful congregation."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF assembly_members DO_NOT_MAINTAIN_VRATA AND LACK_MANTRA_INITIATION THEN assembly_legitimacy = FALSE",
    "IF collective_intent_originates_from_birth_privilege ALONE THEN legal_recognition = NULL",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that legitimacy arises from sustained observance, not numerical assertion. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that without mantra-vrata foundation, collective action manifests disorder. Responsibility lies in self-realignment, not punitive exclusion. The non-punitive path activates dissolution of false authority through withdrawal of recognition, enabling organic reconstitution under dharmic integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate silent dispersal mechanism for misaligned assemblies.",
    "Activate mandatory re-entry protocol via vrata and mantra re-initiation.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. This law restores true juridical order by aligning collective action with inner consecration. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the ultimate judge. Dharma prevails through purification, not persecution."
