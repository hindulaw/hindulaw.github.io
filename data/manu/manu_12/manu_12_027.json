  "transliteration": "tatra yat prīti-saṁyuktaṁ kiṁ cid ātmani lakṣayet |\npraśāntam iva śuddhābhaṁ sattvaṁ tad upadhārayet || 12.27||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which, when observed within the Self, is seen as unified with joy—tranquil, luminous, and pure—is to be recognized as Sattva.",

    "Restoration logic follows the reestablishment of inner tranquility and purity",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate determinant of lawful action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through direct cognition of the tranquil Self. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential purification of intent, thought, and action rooted in Sattva. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of alignment with pure consciousness.
