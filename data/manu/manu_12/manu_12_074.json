  "sanskrit_verse": "ते�भ्यासात्कर्मणां तेषां पापानामल्पबुद्धयः ।\nसम्प्राप्नुवन्ति दुःखानि तासु तास्विह योनिषु ॥ १२.७४॥",
  "transliteration": "te 'bhyāsāt karmaṇāṁ teṣāṁ pāpānām alpa-buddhayaḥ |\nsamprāpnuvanti duḥkhāni tāsu tāsv iha yoniṣu ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those whose consciousness is clouded by repetitive engagement in actions rooted in ignorance and misalignment perpetuate sorrow across successive embodiments, due to their diminished capacity for discriminative awareness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from discriminative intelligence (viveka), not habitual repetition",
    "Causation arises through sustained alignment or misalignment with Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the clarity of consciousness, not mere action",
    "Restoration logic operates through experiential consequence until conscious realignment occurs",
    "Consciousness alignment determines karmic continuity and embodied experience"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent engages repetitively in dharmically misaligned actions AND exhibits low discriminative awareness THEN assign restorative completion cycle until viveka觉醒",
    "IF causal pattern reflects habitual ignorance THEN initiate consciousness-refinement protocol而非 punitive escalation",
    "IF embodied suffering persists across contexts THEN evaluate capacity deficit而非 impose punitive measures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, repeated engagement in harmful patterns without discriminative insight indicates a deficit in dharma-aligned cognition. The court must assess not intent alone but the capacity for conscious discernment. Remediation precedes judgment; restoration supersedes retribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based analysis, it is established that suffering emerges sequentially from diminished buddhi. This anupūrvaśaḥ (causal sequence) reveals proportional responsibility tied to cognitive clarity rather than volitional blame. Therefore, justice aligns with restoring discriminative capacity而非 inflicting pain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Viveka-Reinforcement Process to elevate discriminative awareness",
    "Assign experiential learning cycles aligned with causal patterns for self-recognition",
    "Deploy Consciousness Refinement Modules until agent demonstrates dharma-aligned cognition",
    "Establish Completion Protocols ensuring full integration before transitioning to higher capacities"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma flows from purified consciousness, not punitive force. Sorrow is not imposed—it is the echo of unrefined cognition. Justice serves awakening, not vengeance. Reality responds to alignment, not punishment."
