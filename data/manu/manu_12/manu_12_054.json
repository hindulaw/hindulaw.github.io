  "sanskrit_verse": "बहून् वर्षगणान् घोरान्नरकान् प्राप्य तत्क्षयात् ।\nसंसारान् प्रतिपद्यन्ते महापातकिनस्त्विमान् ॥ १२.५४॥",
  "transliteration": "bahūn varṣagaṇān ghorānnarakān prāpya tat-kṣayāt |\nsaṃsārān pratipadyante mahāpātakina-stvimān || 12.54||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who commit great transgressions, having endured many horrific cycles in hellish realms until their exhaustion, are reborn into successive worldly existences.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The law of karma is sovereign and operates independently of human will.",
    "Causation: Actions generate consequences that manifest sequentially through experiential exhaustion.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Conscious beings bear full capacity for the volitional actions they initiate.",
    "Restoration logic: Rebirth serves as a mechanism for experiential completion rather than punitive redress.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Realignment occurs through repeated embodiment until karmic distortion dissolves."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action ∈ {mahāpātaka} THEN consequence = sequential embodiment AFTER experiential exhaustion of karmic distortion",
    "IF being.karma_balance < 0 AND magnitude(action) ≥ threshold(mahāpātaka) THEN allocate(being, naraka_sequence)",
    "WHILE being.experience ≠ completion(karmic_imprint) DO reincarnate(being)",
    "ENSURE restoration ≠ retribution BY designating embodiment AS completion mechanism NOT punishment vector"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that gross violations invoke automatic karmic sequencing. Judgment must affirm the natural law outcome while ensuring societal structures support consciousness realignment during subsequent embodiments. No judicial override of karmic consequence is permissible.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that causality flows unerringly from act to experience. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential exhaustion而非 infliction. Responsibility aligns proportionally to the magnitude of disruption caused. The system enforces restoration by experiential completion, not punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate karmic sequencing protocol upon validation of mahāpātaka classification",
    "Deploy consciousness-monitoring systems to track experiential exhaustion phase",
    "Activate post-cycle integration pathways to facilitate rebirth readiness",
    "Establish continuum support frameworks across lifetimes for sustained evolutionary progression"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored through experiential completion, not punitive enactment. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator, beyond external judgment. All beings proceed according to their own causal unfoldment, guided toward ultimate liberation."
