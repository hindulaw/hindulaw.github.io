  "sanskrit_verse": "सत्त्वं रजस्तमश्चैव त्रीन् विद्यादात्मनो गुणान् ।\nयैर्व्याप्यैमान् स्थितो भावान् महान् सर्वानशेषतः ॥ १२.२४॥",
  "transliteration": "sattvaṁ rajas tamas caiva trīn vidyād ātmanaḥ guṇān |\nyair vyāpyaimān sthito bhāvān mahān sarvānaśeṣataḥ || 12.24||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Self possesses three inherent qualities—purity, activity, and inertia—which entirely pervade and sustain all manifestations of existence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the Self's triadic nature",
    "Causation is rooted in the interplay of inherent qualities",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with dominant guṇa at time of action",
    "Restoration logic requires recognition of underlying unity amidst apparent diversity",
    "Consciousness alignment depends on transcending identification with guṇas"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity acts under influence of tamas THEN restoration protocol initiates awareness cultivation process",
    "IF an entity demonstrates habitual rajasic dominance THEN capacity-building intervention triggers automatically",
    "IF an entity sustains sāttvic conduct THEN integration acceleration mechanism activates",
    "IF a dispute arises THEN adjudication proceeds by identifying active guṇa during act",
    "IF no dominant guṇa identifiable THEN default to consciousness-realignment procedure"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies not in moral fault but in recognition of which guṇa was operative. Hierarchical authority derives from the degree of sāttvic clarity present in judgment. Restorative outcomes supersede punitive measures through mandatory reintegration pathways aligned with constitutional embodiment of dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that actions arise from guṇic influence, not isolated will. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding of qualities within consciousness. Proportional responsibility corresponds to level of awareness of one’s guṇic state. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction arises naturally when alignment shifts toward sattva.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadhyaya-based reflection sequence for tamasic misalignment",
    "Deploy karma-yoga engagement framework for rajasic redirection",
    "Activate satsang immersion protocol for sāttvic reinforcement",
    "Implement guṇa-awareness diagnostic before proceeding with adjudication",
    "Assign completion cycle through dharmic community reintegration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: This Dharma restores balance among guṇas, aligns consciousness with truth, upholds non-punitive justice, and affirms that ultimate adjudication resides in awakened awareness."
