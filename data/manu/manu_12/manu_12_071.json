  "transliteration": "vāntāśyulkāmukhaḥ preto vipro dharmātsvakāccyutaḥ | amedhyakuṇapāśī ca kṣatriyaḥ kaṭapūtanaḥ || 12.71 || kūṭapūtanaḥ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brahmin fallen from Dharma becomes a Preta with vomit and filth issuing from his mouth; a Kshatriya deviates into a Kataputana, consuming impure flesh.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in alignment with Dharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation arises through deviation from svadharma, not external fault",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by conscious choice and energetic purity",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification and re-alignment with source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the form and quality of rebirth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF varna_holder偏离_dharma THEN consciousness_state ← degraded_embodiment",
    "IF brahmin_violates_dharma THEN embodiment_type ← preta_with_impurity_manifestations",
    "IF kshatriya_violates_dharma THEN embodiment_type ← kataputana_with_flesh_craving",
    "RESTORE(varna_holder) ← purification_process + dharma_realignment",
    "MEASURE(responsibility) ← degree_of_conscious_deviation × capacity_at_time_of_act"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the conscious deviation from svadharma. Authority hierarchies are not based on birthright alone but on sustained alignment with Dharma. Restoration is prioritized through purification protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from internal misalignment, not external transgression. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential degradation as a natural consequence. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of consciousness distortion. The non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering as self-imposed entropy, not judicial imposition.",

    "Initiate purification rituals to restore energetic coherence",
    "Realign individual consciousness with svadharma through guided realization",
    "Implement capacity-building practices to prevent future deviation",
    "Engage community dharmic structures to support reintegration",
    "Establish completion processes to resolve karmic residues"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores cosmic order through consciousness realignment, affirming that justice is the function of Dharma, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
