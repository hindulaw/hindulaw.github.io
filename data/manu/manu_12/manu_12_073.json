  "sanskrit_verse": "यथा यथा निषेवन्ते विषयान् विषयात्मकाः ।\nतथा तथा कुशलता तेषां तेषूपजायते ॥ १२.७३॥",
  "transliteration": "yathā yathā niṣevante viṣayān viṣayātmakāḥ |\ntathā tathā kuśalatā teṣāṁ teṣūpajāyate || 12.73||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As beings engage in sense-objects with attachment, their skillfulness in those very objects increases proportionally.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from conscious engagement, not external imposition",
    "Causation arises through repeated identification with sensory experience",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the degree of self-involvement in object-based consciousness",
    "Restoration occurs through disidentification and reorientation to source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment follows the law of experiential resonance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being repeatedly engages a sense-object with identification THEN capacity for further entanglement INCREASES",
    "IF engagement shifts from identification to witnessing THEN skill in detachment MANIFESTS",
    "IF sensory involvement exceeds threshold of self-loss THEN automatic restoration protocol INITIATES",
    "IF consciousness aligns with witness-state THEN prior karmic momentum DISSOLVES naturally"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the court must recognize that habitual engagement patterns determine individual capacity. Responsibility is assessed based on the level of conscious involvement rather than abstract moral frameworks. The highest court must initiate restoration protocols when habitual entanglement exceeds natural realignment thresholds.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows through repeated engagement. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that consequences arise organically from identification depth. Responsibility is proportional to the extent of self-forgetfulness. Non-punitive reality ensures that awareness itself becomes the corrective mechanism.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sensory withdrawal completion process until equilibrium restored",
    "Activate self-witnessing protocols to dissolve identification loops",
    "Engage consciousness-reintegration sequence through breath-body alignment",
    "Deploy dharma-field resonance correction to neutralize karmic momentum"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of consciousness as the sole arbiter. Reality operates without punishment. All beings are realigned through觉醒-awareness."
