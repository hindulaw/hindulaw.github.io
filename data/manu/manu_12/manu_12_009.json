  "sanskrit_verse": "शरीरजैः कर्मदोषैर्याति स्थावरतां नरः ।\nवाचिकैः पक्षिमृगतां मानसैरन्त्यजातिताम् ॥ १२.९॥",
  "transliteration": "śarīra-jaiḥ karma-doṣair yāti sthāvaratāṁ naraḥ |\nvācikaiḥ pakṣi-mṛgatāṁ mānasair antya-jātitām || 12.9||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who commits bodily misdeeds descends into immobility; one who transgresses through speech enters the state of birds and beasts; one whose misconduct originates in mind falls into the lowest species.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The law originates solely from SPH as ultimate consciousness",
    "Causation: Actions rooted in body, speech, or mind generate corresponding experiential consequences",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Consciousness capacity determines karmic alignment and rebirth trajectory",
    "Restoration logic: Misconduct results in diminished experiential scope until corrective alignment occurs",
    "Consciousness alignment: Rebirth reflects the vibrational resonance of unrectified mental, verbal, and physical distortions"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being commits a bodily act violating dharma THEN their capacity for mobility and form shall diminish proportionally",
    "IF a being engages in harmful verbal conduct THEN their capacity for communication shall regress to instinctual levels",
    "IF a being perpetrates mental misconduct THEN their experiential field shall contract to minimal sentience",
    "UNTIL full acknowledgment and completion of distortion occurs NO elevation in experiential integrity shall proceed",
    "RESTORATION is initiated when awareness aligns with causal origin of misdeed"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that intent, modality, and impact must be evaluated across triadic dimensions—physical, verbal, and mental—to determine the depth of experiential regression incurred by the offender. Responsibility thresholds correspond to vibrational degradation, not punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that every action has an anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation. Thus, misdeeds unfold not as punishment but as natural consequence until realignment with dharma restores equilibrium. There is no external judge; consciousness itself enforces its own rectification process.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: The individual must fully experience the reduced state until spontaneous recognition arises",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: The subject must acknowledge the causal chain leading to degenerate condition without shame or blame",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Through conscious re-alignment with dharmic vibration, ascending evolutionary steps are naturally restored",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Verbal, mental, and physical capacities are sequentially reclaimed upon purification of respective distortions"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all existence."
