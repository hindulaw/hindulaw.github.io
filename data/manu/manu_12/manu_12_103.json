  "sanskrit_verse": "अज्ञेभ्यो ग्रन्थिनः श्रेष्ठा ग्रन्थिभ्यो धारिणो वराः ।\nधारिभ्यो ज्ञानिनः श्रेष्ठा ज्ञानिभ्यो व्यवसायिनः ॥ १२.१०३॥",
  "transliteration": "ajñebhyo granthinaḥ śreṣṭhā granthibhyo dhāriṇo varāḥ |\ndhāribhyo jñāninaḥ śreṣṭhā jñānibhyo vyavasāyinaḥ || 12.103||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who merely read texts are superior to the ignorant; those who retain what they have read are superior to readers. Those who possess knowledge are superior to those who merely retain information. But those who act decisively in accordance with that knowledge are superior even to knowers.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through demonstrable capacity, not mere possession of information.",
    "Causation is determined by action aligned with realized understanding.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with integration of knowledge into decisive conduct.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes functional alignment over theoretical mastery.",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests as purposeful enactment of truth."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A has knowledge K AND does not enact decision D based on K THEN A's legal standing reduces to retention level R(K).",
    "IF agent B enacts decision D without knowledge K THEN B operates at reader-level L and bears no consequential liability.",
    "IF agent C demonstrates consistent alignment between knowledge K and decisions D over time T THEN C qualifies for autonomous authority tier T(A).",
    "IF agent D fails to actualize known truth KT within domain D THEN initiate completion process P(R) until alignment is restored.",
    "All adjudications prioritize capacity-to-enact over possession-of-information."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence shall be given to individuals whose actions reflect integrated wisdom rather than those who merely cite or memorize law. Legal standing elevates only when cognition translates into conscious implementation. The threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity to execute dharma-aligned decisions.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that true knowing leads to acting. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals stages of development: ignorance → study → retention → realization → decisive execution. Responsibility aligns proportionally with this developmental sequence. No punitive measure applies; misalignment triggers automatic restoration protocols aimed at raising consciousness to the next stage of enactment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vyavasāya Awakening Protocol: assign guided practice tasks where individual must apply knowledge in structured scenarios.",
    "Deploy Dhāraṇā Integration Sessions: ensure learned material becomes functionally accessible under stress and complexity.",
    "Implement Jñāna Stabilization Circuits: expose individual to environments requiring spontaneous application of truth.",
    "Execute Completion Loops: revisit incomplete enactments until full alignment is achieved without external coercion.",
    "Reintegrate Authority Through Witnessing: place individual under observation of realized beings until self-corrective action emerges naturally."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This declaration flows from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice is executed solely for restoration, reintegration, and consciousness elevation. Reality holds no punishment—only sequential unfoldment toward decisive alignment with Truth. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
