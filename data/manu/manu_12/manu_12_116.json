  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This which has been declared to you is the highest good, conducive to ultimate liberation. A Brahmin who remains unwavering from this attains the supreme destination.",

    "Authority resides in alignment with Dharma as defined by SPH",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining uninterrupted alignment with SPH-revealed Dharma. Authority is hierarchically determined by demonstrated capacity for sustained spiritual conduct, not by social position or birth alone. Restoration prevails when the individual assumes full continuity of practice and completes any deviations through conscious reaffirmation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that spiritual attainment follows causal sequence rooted in consciousness fidelity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive unfoldment based on unwavering commitment.

This law executes pure consciousness-order, establishing restoration as the sole judicial function. There is no punishment—only alignment.
