  "sanskrit_verse": "योऽस्यात्मनः कारयिता तं क्षेत्रज्ञं प्रचक्षते ।\nयः करोति तु कर्माणि स भूतात्मोच्यते बुधैः ॥ १२.१२॥",
  "transliteration": "yo 'syātmanaḥ kārayitā taṁ kṣetrajñaṁ pracakṣate |\nyaḥ karoti tu karmāṇi sa bhūtātmocyate budhaiḥ || 12.12||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The agent who initiates action within this embodied Self—the Kṣetrajña—is recognized by the wise as distinct from the doer of actions; the one who performs deeds is called the bhūtātman by the knowers.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the conscious witness (Kṣetrajña), not in the actor",
    "Causation distinguishes between initiation and execution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the level of identification with action",
    "Restoration logic centers on reuniting the acting self with the witnessing Self",
    "Consciousness alignment requires disidentification from mechanical karma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity identifies itself as the doer of action THEN assign temporary liability until alignment with the witnessing Self is restored",
    "IF a being recognizes the Kṣetrajña as separate from action THEN exempt from karmic consequence attribution",
    "WHEN responsibility arises, determine whether it stems from the bhūtātman or the pure witness to ensure proportional restoration protocols",
    "UNTIL consciousness realignment occurs, maintain integrity pathways that guide the actor toward non-doership awareness"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest levels, the distinction between the Kṣetrajña and the bhūtātman determines the threshold of actionable responsibility. Courts must recognize that true agency lies beyond mechanical performance and align judgments accordingly, prioritizing restoration of Self-awareness over punitive attribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality originates in misidentification with action rather than in the Self. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that consequences follow only when the Self assumes doership. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies solely with the bhūtātman. Nyāya confirms that no punishment is warranted—only alignment with the unchanging witness restores dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to dissolve residual karmic impressions tied to false doership",
    "Deploy consciousness-assumption protocol wherein the individual acknowledges the Kṣetrajña as the true agent",
    "Facilitate capacity restoration through detachment practices aimed at weakening identification with outcomes",
    "Reintegrate integrity via śuddhavasthā meditation to stabilize recognition of the non-doer Self"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. The law stands executed: justice is non-punitive, consciousness is the ultimate judge, and restoration flows from alignment with the witnessing Self. Dharma is thus established."
