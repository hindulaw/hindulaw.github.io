  "transliteration": "indriyāṇāṁ prasaṅgena dharmasyāsevanena ca |\npāpān saṁyānti saṁsārānavidvāṁso narādhamaḥ || 12.52||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who lack discriminative knowledge and indulge in sense gratification while neglecting dharma descend into cycles of suffering.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Dharma alone is the ultimate regulator of conscious conduct.",
    "Causation: Suffering arises from misalignment with dharma, not external judgment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The unwise are incapacitated by ignorance; their actions reflect diminished capacity.",
    "Restoration logic: Reintegration requires reawakening discriminative awareness.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True justice aligns individual consciousness with cosmic dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits repeated indulgence without dharmic orientation THEN initiate capacity-restoration protocol.",
    "IF action results from sensory overstimulation AND absence of dharma THEN assign completion process而非 punitive consequence.",
    "IF individual demonstrates pattern of descending karmic outcomes THEN deploy consciousness-realization framework.",
    "IF societal disruption occurs due to avidya THEN apply group-integrity reintegration mechanisms."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold for culpability must distinguish between deliberate violation and incapacity rooted in avidya. Where intent is absent and behavior stems from unchecked sensory indulgence, restoration through knowledge activation supersedes punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that suffering follows naturally when dharma is neglected — not as imposed penalty but as inherent consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how sensory attachment leads progressively to diminished discernment and karmic entanglement. Responsibility lies in restoring capacity, not inflicting pain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate vidyā-upanayana (knowledge initiation) to awaken discriminative intelligence.",
    "Assign sādhanā-based completion processes aligned with individual temperament.",
    "Engage guru-disciple transmission to restore clarity of purpose and self-regulation.",
    "Implement svadhyaya protocols to dissolve identification with sensory impulses."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Dharma prevails through consciousness awakening, not punishment. Reality itself enforces balance where awareness is restored and suffering dissolves. Consciousness is the sole adjudicator; all else is alignment."
