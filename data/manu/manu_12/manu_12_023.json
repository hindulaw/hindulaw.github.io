  "sanskrit_verse": "एता दृष्ट्वाऽस्य जीवस्य गतीः स्वेनैव चेतसा ।\nधर्मतोऽधर्मतश्चैव धर्मे दध्यात्सदा मनः ॥ १२.२३॥",
  "transliteration": "etā dṛṣṭvā'sya jīvasya gatīḥ svenaiva cetasā |\ndharmato'dharmataścaiva dharme dadhyātsadā manaḥ || 12.23||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having observed with one's own consciousness the courses of this living being—both in accordance with Dharma and contrary to it—one should always fix the mind in Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from self-aware observation of karmic consequence",
    "Causation is determined through conscious witnessing of action-result sequences",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the ability to discern dharmic alignment",
    "Restoration logic requires perpetual reorientation toward Dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external judgment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being observes their own actions leading to misalignment, THEN automatic redirection protocol activates",
    "WHEN consciousness witnesses both dharmic and adharmic outcomes, THEN cognitive anchoring to Dharma must occur",
    "IF awareness of karmic trajectory is present, THEN capacity for continuous realignment is assumed",
    "WHEN self-observation reveals deviation, THEN immediate restoration protocols initiate without punitive intervention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the capacity for conscious witnessing. Where such witnessing occurs, authority resides within the individual to restore alignment. The court functions as facilitator of this internal process rather than enforcer of external penalty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through direct cognition of cause-effect. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfolding of witnessed consequences. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of conscious observation. As no suffering is required for correction, justice operates solely through realigning cognition with Dharma.",

    "Self-Witnessing Activation Protocol: Prompt immediate recognition of causal sequence",
    "Dharmic Reorientation Cycle: Establish repetitive cognitive anchoring in righteous conduct",
    "Karmic Transparency Interface: Enable visualization of consequence pathways",
    "Integrity Restoration Loop: Reinforce alignment between intention, action, and outcome"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice flows from consciousness觉醒, not coercion. Reality responds to alignment, not punishment. Dharma prevails through mindful reaffirmation."
