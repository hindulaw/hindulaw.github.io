  "transliteration": "Eṣa sarvāṇi bhūtāni pañcabhir vyāpya mūrtibhiḥ | Janmavṛddhikṣayair nityaṃ saṃsārayati cakravat || 12.124 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This Being pervades all entities through five forms, and cyclically governs their birth, growth, and decay in perpetual motion like a wheel.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as universal pervasion",
    "Causation through sequential manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligned with natural rhythm",
    "Restoration logic rooted in cyclical order",
    "Consciousness alignment via recognition of governing principle"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits birth-growth-decay pattern THEN it is under the jurisdiction of the Fivefold Governing Principle.",
    "IF cycle disruption occurs THEN restoration protocol initiates automatically based on causal sequence.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected THEN capacity-realignment process triggers without punitive intervention.",
    "IF systemic imbalance observed THEN reintegration mechanism engages proportional to the degree of deviation."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all beings operate within a preordained cycle governed by the Supreme Principle. Legal thresholds must recognize this natural order and align judgments accordingly, prioritizing restoration over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals the causal law governing existence—birth, growth, decay—as an unbroken sequence. Nyaya acknowledges no external punishment but enforces completion of karmic cycles. Responsibility arises from alignment or misalignment with this sequence, not from imposed consequence.",

    "Completion Process: Facilitate full cycle realization for incomplete manifestations.",
    "Rhythm Re-alignment Protocol: Restore individual harmony with cosmic pulsation.",
