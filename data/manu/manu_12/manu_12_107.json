  "transliteration": "naiḥśreyasamidaṃ karma yathoditamaśeṣataḥ | mānavasyāsya śāstrasya rahasyamupadiśyate || 12.107|| upadekṣyate",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This action, fully described as leading to the highest good, is declared as the secret teaching of this human scripture.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from SPH as the ultimate source of dharma",
    "Causation aligns with conscious intention directed toward naiḥśreyasa (highest welfare)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's alignment with revealed truth",
    "Restoration occurs through adherence to actions that uphold spiritual supremacy",
    "Consciousness alignment is the foundational metric of lawful conduct"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act aligns with the definition of naiḥśreyasam THEN it shall be recognized as dharmically valid",
    "IF a human scripture reveals a secret teaching AND the teaching leads to highest welfare THEN enforce its application without exception",
    "IF an individual performs an action in accordance with śāstra AND intent aligns with spiritual supremacy THEN no external penalty shall apply",
    "IF capacity for understanding rahasya exists THEN responsibility for correct implementation arises automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any action demonstrated to conform to the precise definition of naiḥśreyasam as outlined in śāstra must be upheld categorically. The threshold for responsibility lies not in punitive frameworks but in the capacity to recognize and actualize revealed knowledge. Authority flows exclusively from SPH as the ultimate interpreter and revealer of such truths.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that karmic causality operates through alignment with revealed truth rather than through punitive consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of effects based on consciousness-state rather than imposed judgment. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of access to and embodiment of the rahasya. There is no punitive reality; all consequences arise from natural dharmic alignment or misalignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure full articulation and execution of the action as defined in śāstra",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Confirm individual awareness and acceptance of the rahasya prior to enactment",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide access to teachings necessary for proper understanding of the śāstra",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Reinforce alignment between cognition, speech, and behavior in accordance with the revealed action"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of actions aligned with naiḥśreyasam. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
