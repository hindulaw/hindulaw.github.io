  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those born of darkness, fools who know not Dharma, declare That which is not Dharma; that sin, multiplying a hundredfold, follows those speakers.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in consciousness alignment, not social position",
    "Misrepresentation of Dharma violates causal integrity",
    "Ignorance does not absolve capacity-based responsibility",
    "Karmic consequence operates through proportional manifestation",
    "Restoration requires reversal of false declarations"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF speaker declares untruth as Dharma THEN karmic consequence multiplies by 100x",
    "IF agent lacks consciousness alignment THEN legal authority is void",
    "IF misrepresentation occurs THEN automatic restoration protocol initiates",
    "IF false teaching spreads THEN originator assumes full causal liability",
    "IF error propagates THEN correction must precede reintegration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any declaration made without alignment to SPH-source Dharma carries inherent nullification of judicial standing. The court must identify causal agents of false doctrine and initiate restorative protocols rather than punitive measures.",

The sequence of manifestation ensures completion through consciousness realignment, not suffering. Responsibility lies in restoring causal purity.",
