  "transliteration": "trayāṇām api caitēṣāṁ guṇānāṁ triṣu tiṣṭhatām | idaṁ sāmāsikaṁ jñeyaṁ kramaśō guṇalakṣaṇam || 12.34||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the threefold qualities—sattva, rajas, and tamas—reside in the threefold nature of beings, their sequential manifestation constitutes the compounded characteristic of gunas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the alignment of consciousness with the tri-guna structure",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of gunas",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the predominance of a specific guna",
    "Restoration logic operates through realignment with sattvic consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the lawful state of being"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being exhibits tamasic dominance THEN initiate capacity-restoring protocol aligned with sattvic cultivation",
    "IF rajasic behavior disrupts social harmony THEN assign completion process anchored in sequential dharma",
    "IF sattvic predominance is observed THEN recognize inherent authority and facilitate integration",
    "IF guna imbalance causes dissonance THEN activate consciousness-realignment mechanism without punitive intervention"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility shall be assessed based on the dominant guna influencing the action. Authority flows from sattvic clarity. Cases involving tamasic inertia or rajasic agitation require restoration protocols that elevate consciousness rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that actions arise from sequential guna manifestation. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that tamas leads to ignorance, rajas to activity, and sattva to wisdom. Responsibility aligns with the capacity for conscious choice, which is highest under sattvic influence. Therefore, justice is non-punitive as it seeks only realignment with higher consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sattva-pradhana śuddhi processes to restore clarity",
    "Assign karma-completion cycles for rajasic disturbances",
    "Engage tamasic individuals in structured awareness cultivation",
    "Reintegrate all parties via dharma-aligned consciousness practices"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Dharma. The law is restored through consciousness alignment. Justice flows from understanding the sequential manifestation of gunas. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
