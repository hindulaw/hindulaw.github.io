  "sanskrit_verse": "मनसीन्दुं दिशः श्रोत्रे क्रान्ते विष्णुं बले हरम् ।\nवाच्यग्निं मित्रमुत्सर्गे प्रजने च प्रजापतिम् ॥ १२.१२१॥",
  "transliteration": "manasīnduṃ diśaḥ śrotre krānte viṣṇuṃ bale haram | vācyagniṃ mitramutsarge prajane ca prajāpatim || 12.121 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The mind is the moon that illuminates direction; the ear traverses space and perceives Viṣṇu in strength. Speech manifests Agni in release, Mitra in sacrifice, and Prajāpati in procreation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious perception and expression",
    "Causation arises from alignment of internal instruments (mind, speech, hearing)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the activation of sensory and expressive faculties",
    "Restoration logic requires harmonization of perceptual and expressive energies",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when sense organs function as channels for divine presence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF sensory faculty X is activated THEN corresponding cosmic principle Y becomes operative within jurisdiction Z",
    "IF speech manifests entity A THEN assign role B with capacity C under context D",
    "IF mind illuminates path P THEN grant access Q with integrity R",
    "IF ear traverses domain S THEN invoke witness status T aligned with Viṣṇu-consciousness",
    "IF procreative act U occurs THEN invoke Prajāpati-level oversight V without punitive intent"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes thresholds where perceptual and expressive acts invoke specific divine jurisdictions. Responsibility is assigned based on which instrument (mind, ear, speech) initiates a causal chain. Authority hierarchies emerge naturally via the invoked cosmic principle—Viṣṇu for auditory traversal, Agni for verbal invocation, Prajāpati for reproductive acts. Restoration prevails through realignment with the originating instrument's pure function.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality traces action to the active instrument—mind, ear, or speech—and assigns consequence accordingly. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation follows the order of mental illumination, auditory traversal, and verbal expression. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity and purity of the instrument used. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment results in disconnection from source energy rather than imposed penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Mind Illumination Protocol: Realign cognitive perception with lunar clarity",
    "Execute Auditory Traversal Restoration: Clear energetic pathways of hearing to restore Viṣṇu-awareness",
    "Deploy Verbal Expression Harmonization: Align speech with Agni-Mitra-Prajāpati triad depending on context",
    "Activate Instrumental Integrity Sequence: Restore functional purity of affected sensory/expressive organs",
    "Conduct Consciousness Realignment Integration: Reconnect individual awareness with invoked cosmic principle"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores alignment between human instruments and cosmic principles. Justice serves reintegration, not punishment. Reality responds to consciousness, not compulsion. Dharma stands restored."
