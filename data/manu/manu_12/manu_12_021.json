  "transliteration": "yadi tu prāyaśo 'dharmam sevate dharmam alpaśaḥ |\ntair bhūtaiḥ sa parityakto yāmīḥ prāpnoti yātanaḥ || 12.21||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When one habitually engages in adharmic conduct while performing dharma only minimally, beings abandon that individual, who then descends into realms of suffering.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises through habitual consciousness patterns, not isolated acts",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by sustained engagement with dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates through natural consequence rather than imposed judgment",
    "Consciousness alignment determines one's resonance with sustaining forces of existence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity repeatedly violates dharmic principles AND demonstrates minimal adherence to dharma, THEN withdraw support structures automatically",
    "IF habitual adharmic behavior is detected, INITIATE consciousness-realization protocol to restore capacity for alignment",
    "IF societal integration weakens due to persistent adharmic orientation, TRIGGER reintegration sequence based on causal pattern analysis",
    "DO NOT enforce punitive measures; INSTEAD redirect energetic alignment toward dharmic resonance"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, when a party demonstrates chronic disregard for foundational dharmic tenets despite nominal compliance, judicial authority must recognize the withdrawal of collective support as a natural outcome. The court’s role is to initiate restoration protocols, realigning consciousness rather than assigning blame or penalty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that suffering emerges from dissonance with universal law, not external punishment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how repeated adharmic choices sever harmonious connections. Proportional responsibility lies in recognizing that abandonment by supporting entities reflects inner alignment failure. Suffering is not inflicted—it is the absence of alignment.",

    "Initiate Consciousness Completion Process to restore dharmic sensitivity",
    "Engage Responsibility Assumption Protocol through guided introspective inquiry",
    "Reintegrate energetic integrity via alignment with sustaining universal principles",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law proceeds from the Source. Dharma is restored through alignment, not force. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
