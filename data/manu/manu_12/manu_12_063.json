  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The vulture consumes flesh; the water-bird consumes fat; the oil-bird consumes oil; the flesh-eating bird consumes meat; the curlew consumes salt; the wagtail consumes curds.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority through svabhava-dharma (inherent nature)",
    "Causation via prakriti-specific alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in jati-nature",
    "Restoration logic through dharmic ecological balance",
    "Consciousness alignment with natural order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits svabhava-dharma THEN no external imposition of contrary dharma",
    "IF action aligns with jati-nature THEN action is intrinsically lawful",
    "IF disruption occurs in ecological-dharmic order THEN restoration is executed by re-aligning capacities",
    "IF consciousness recognizes inherent role THEN responsibility arises spontaneously"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving roles or actions defined by innate capacity or species-specific function, courts must recognize that svabhava-dharma supersedes imposed norms. Legal thresholds of responsibility arise not from abstract codes but from alignment with one's intrinsic nature. Thus, judgments should restore harmony rather than impose penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that each being operates under its own svabhava-dharma. Causality follows anupurvasah — sequential manifestation based on inherent design. Responsibility is proportional to conscious recognition of one’s role within the cosmic order. There is no punitive consequence because misalignment is corrected through realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Re-establishment of natural habitat to support svabhava-dharma expression",
    "Guided awareness protocols to awaken dormant dharmic instincts",
    "Community integration rituals to reaffirm role-based interdependence",
    "Capacity recalibration through sattvic environmental conditioning"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. All beings fulfill their dharma according to their svabhava. Justice restores alignment without punishment. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
