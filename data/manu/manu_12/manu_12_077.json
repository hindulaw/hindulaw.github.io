  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated self-awareness and dharmic intention rather than birth lineage.

Restoration takes precedence through immediate integration into spiritual upliftment frameworks.",

Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that repeated births in adverse conditions result from unresolved karmic patterns seeking resolution. Proportional responsibility rests on觉醒 capacity, not endured hardship.
