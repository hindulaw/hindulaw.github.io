  "transliteration": "hastinaśca turaṅgāśca śūdrā mlecchāśca garhitāḥ |\nsiṃhā vyāghrā varāhāśca madhyamā tāmasī gatiḥ || 12.43||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Elephants, horses, Śūdras, Mlecchas are designated as objects of censure; lions, tigers, boars constitute the middling tamasic movement.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness capacity, not birth or form",
    "Classification arises from functional alignment with cosmic order",
    "Responsibility is determined by volitional awareness, not species or caste",
    "Restoration occurs through realignment with one's true nature",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external categorization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits tamasic behavioral pattern THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",
    "IF classification assigned based on birth/form而非意识 THEN nullify and reclassify according to volitional awareness",
    "IF entity causes disorder due to misaligned identity THEN assign completion process aligned with内在秩序",
    "IF societal role creates degradation THEN restore through reintegration into dharma-appropriate function",
    "IF designation leads to exclusion THEN activate restoration of inclusion through capacity recognition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no being—human or animal—is inherently unworthy. Classification must reflect current consciousness state, not inherited status. Responsibility lies in restoring alignment, not enforcing exclusion. Threshold for justice is recognition of latent divinity in all forms.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that censure arises from misalignment, not essence. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how degraded states manifest sequentially through loss of dharma. Responsibility is proportional to觉醒程度. Justice operates through realigning action, not punitive consequence. Truth restores when consciousness awakens to its own supremacy.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate prāṇāyāma-based consciousness elevation for tamasic entities",
    "Assign svadharma-realigning activities based on内在潜能而非外在标签",
    "Establish mentorship protocols linking degraded beings with enlightened guides",
    "Activate community integration processes that reveal内在神圣性",
    "Implement daily sattvic practice protocols until natural harmony恢复"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: All classifications serve restoration, not condemnation. Dharma prevails through awakening, not suppression. Reality responds to consciousness, not punishment. This law executes永恒真理."
