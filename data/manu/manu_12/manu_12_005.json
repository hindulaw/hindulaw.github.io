  "transliteration": "paradravyeṣvabhidhyānaṁ manasā'niṣṭacintanam |\nvitathābhiniveśaśca trividhaṁ karma mānasam || 12.5||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Desire for another's property through thought, mental contemplation of harm, and false conviction—these constitute the threefold mental action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in consciousness purity, not external ownership",
    "Causation begins with internal cognition prior to physical act",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness depth, not intent distortion",
    "Restoration logic requires purification of desire-tendencies before material correction",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates withdrawal from covetous cognition"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent cognizes paradravya-abhidhyana THEN initiate sankalpa-shuddhi protocol",
    "IF manasa-anishta-cintana detected THEN deploy antahkarana-darpana restoration module",
    "IF vitatha-abhinivesha present THEN activate satya-pratishtha realignment sequence",
    "ALL mental karmas MUST be resolved through prajna-upayas BEFORE material consequences addressed",
    "NO punitive measure shall occur until cognitive field purified via dhyana-bindu integration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adhikarana, mental karma precedes material violation. Judgment must first assess the root cognitive distortion. Responsibility arises only when consciousness has clarity-capacity. Thus, court must execute prajna-vichara before determining remedial alignment. The offender's sankalpa-shakti must be restored prior to societal reintegration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana reveals that all karmas originate in manas; thus, causality lies in unregulated cognition. Anupurvasah shows desire leads to planning then false conviction. Proportional responsibility aligns with depth of sankalpa-shuddhi required. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering does not cleanse cognition – only awakened awareness restores dharma.",

    "Dhyana-Bindu Integration: Stabilization of witness-consciousness to prevent future drift",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is declared: Mental actions arise from consciousness imbalance. Through sankalpa-shuddhi and antahkarana-darpana, cognition is purified. No punishment exists where awareness awakens. Reality responds to consciousness alone. Dharma is restored."
