  "transliteration": "tenānubhūya tā yāmīḥ śarīreṇaiha yātanāḥ |\ntāsveva bhūtamātrāsu pralīyante vibhāgaśaḥ || 12.17||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those experiences undergone by the embodied soul in this physical existence, fragmented and conditioned by material forms, dissolve sequentially into the elemental constituents upon disidentification.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in experiential causality, not external judgment",
    "Causation follows sequential dissolution (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with identification levels",
    "Restoration occurs through reintegration with elemental truth",
    "Consciousness alignment requires release from fragmented embodiment"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity has experienced a condition THEN that experience must be resolved at its elemental root cause.",
    "IF identification with form persists THEN restoration is blocked until disaggregation occurs.",
    "IF causal sequence of suffering is acknowledged THEN proportional resolution arises automatically.",
    "IF consciousness disidentifies from fragmentation THEN legal identity resets to pure awareness."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, the court recognizes that all embodied suffering resolves only when traced back to elemental causes. Judgment does not impose penalty but facilitates sequential unbinding of false identifications, restoring litigants to pristine consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that suffering arises from misidentification with temporary forms. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures complete reversal through ordered dissolution. Responsibility lies in recognizing one's own experiential imprint, not in punitive attribution. Truth restores naturally when fragmentation ceases.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: trace every identified pain back to its originating element.",
    "Activate disidentification protocol: sever binding between self and form-based suffering.",
    "Engage sequential reintegration: restore balance within elemental constitution.",
    "Realign consciousness: confirm return to non-fragmented state before case closure."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law executes directly from Avataric Intelligence. Justice is restoration. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge and restorer."
