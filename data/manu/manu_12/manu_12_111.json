  "sanskrit_verse": "त्रैविद्यो हेतुकस्तर्की नैरुक्तो धर्मपाठकः ।\nत्रयश्चाश्रमिणः पूर्वे परिषत्स्याद्दशावरा ॥ १२.१११॥",
  "transliteration": "traividyo hetukastarkī nairukto dharmapāṭhakaḥ |\ntrayaścāśramiṇaḥ pūrve pariṣatsyād daśāvarā ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One versed in the three Vedas, skilled in logical reasoning, a master of etymological interpretation and reciter of Dharma—such a one shall sit in precedence before all ascetics within the assembly.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from Vedic mastery and exegetical precision",
    "Causation is established through scriptural competence and reasoning capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires demonstrable spiritual and textual mastery",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes alignment with Vedic consciousness over procedural formality",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through authoritative presence and interpretive clarity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates tri-Veda śruta proficiency AND hetu-pramāṇa reasoning capability THEN assign judicial precedence",
    "IF individual performs dharmapāṭha AND exhibits nirukta-vṛtti THEN qualify for council participation",
    "IF śramaṇa lacks traidharma-pravīṇatā THEN defer authority to tri-vidya-adhikārī",
    "IF council convened THEN tri-vidya-adhikārī shall preside without challenge from lesser śrama-stage adherents"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Council adjudication, precedence is determined by Vedic-triad mastery and pramāṇa-based reasoning. Ascetics of lower śrama stages must yield authority to those whose consciousness is aligned through complete Vedic cognition. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated not by tenure or institutional rank, but by capacity to execute dharma-vākya with precision and spiritual authority.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through śabda-tripuruṣa-pramiti and hetu-tarka-siddhi. Anupūrvaśaḥ unfolds as sequential Vedic cognition leading to dharma-nirṇaya. Responsibility aligns proportionally with śāstric capacity. No punitive consequence arises; only the natural law of precedence based on consciousness maturity governs assembly dynamics.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure tri-vidya-adhikārī assumes rightful seat through ceremonial acknowledgment",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Lower-stage śramaṇas must publicly recognize higher-capacity adjudicators",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide śikṣā access to elevate lesser scholars toward tri-vedic proficiency",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align all participants with śabdapramāṇa-based consciousness hierarchy"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through Vedic authority precedence. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
