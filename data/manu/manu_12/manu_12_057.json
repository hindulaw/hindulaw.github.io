  "transliteration": "lūtā'hisaraṭānāṃ ca tiraścāṃ cāmbucāriṇām | hiṃsrāṇāṃ ca piśācānāṃ steno vipraḥ sahasraśaḥ || 12.57 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brahmin who commits theft is culpable in the measure equivalent to a thousand thieves among predatory creatures such as lice, insects, aquatic beings, violent carnivores, and malevolent spirits.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from spiritual capacity and social function, not birth alone.",
    "Causation arises through volitional misalignment with Dharma-sourced consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates inversely with societal role and spiritual privilege.",
    "Restoration logic requires proportional realignment based on disruption magnitude.",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate determinant of lawful behavior."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor = Brahmin AND action = theft THEN culpability_weight = 1000 * base_theft_value.",
    "IF social_function(actor) > threshold THEN restoration_cost *= inverse_privilege_coefficient.",
    "IF intent ≠ survival_necessity THEN consciousness_reintegration_protocol.activate().",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations by individuals occupying high dharmic roles, the court must apply elevated thresholds of accountability rooted in capacity, not mere act-value. The Brahmin's transgression demands systemic recalibration due to his role in sustaining cosmic-social order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that higher capacity entails greater causal influence; thus, deviation incurs proportionally intensified correction. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential misalignment from consciousness-first principles. Responsibility aligns with functional disruption. Retribution has no place—only completion and reintegration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate full asset restitution process under witness supervision.",
    "Assign corrective service aligned with violated domain until equilibrium restored.",
    "Enforce guided introspection sessions with qualified spiritual authority.",
    "Implement community transparency protocol during rehabilitation phase.",
    "Activate peer-group integrity reinforcement mechanism post-reintegration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Theft by a Brahmin disrupts cosmic-social harmony and necessitates amplified restoration without punitive consequence. Dharma stands reinstated. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness reigns supreme as the sole adjudicator."
