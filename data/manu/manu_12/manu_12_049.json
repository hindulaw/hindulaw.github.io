  "sanskrit_verse": "यज्वान ऋषयो देवा वेदा ज्योतींषि वत्सराः ।\nपितरश्चैव साध्याश्च द्वितीया सात्त्विकी गतिः ॥ १२.४९॥",
  "transliteration": "yajvāna ṛṣayo devā vedā jyotiṃṣi vatsarāḥ | pitaraścaiva sādhyāśca dvitīyā sāttvikī gatiḥ || 12.49||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who perform sacrifices, the seers, gods, Vedas, luminaries, years, ancestors, and perfected beings—all follow the second, sattvic path of departure.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with sattvic consciousness",
    "Causation flows through ritual and sacred order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from knowledge and action in harmony with dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates through reintegration into cosmic rhythm",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful trajectory"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs sacrificial duty THEN qualify for sattvic progression pathway",
    "IF entity aligns with Vedic rhythm THEN classify under sattvic jurisdiction",
    "IF being honors ancestral lineage THEN activate ancestral restoration protocol",
    "IF consciousness demonstrates Vedic resonance THEN grant access to second path rights",
    "IF temporal cycle aligns with ritual THEN synchronize judicial process accordingly"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined by alignment with sattvic pathways. Entities demonstrating ritual integrity, ancestral reverence, and Vedic resonance are governed under the second path—where authority is derived from spiritual capacity rather than punitive enforcement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that sattvic trajectory is established through sacrificial alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfoldment of consciousness along the sattvic axis. Proportional responsibility correlates with vibrational attunement. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that deviation is corrected through realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sacrificial completion process to restore causal alignment",
    "Activate ancestral communion protocols for integrity reintegration",
    "Engage Vedic resonance harmonization to realign consciousness frequency",
    "Implement ritual rectification procedures to reclaim sattvic pathway access",
    "Establish temporal synchronization with cosmic rhythm to restore lawful flow"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of Law. This verse establishes the sattvic path as a constitutional framework for consciousness-based jurisprudence. Justice is executed through restoration, not punishment. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
