  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्कर्म कृत्वा कुर्वंश्च करिष्यंश्चैव लज्जति । तज्ज्ञेयं विदुषा सर्वं तामसं गुणलक्षणम् ॥ १२.३५॥",
  "transliteration": "yat karma kṛtvā kurvañca kariṣyañcaiva lajjati | tajjñeyaṃ viduṣā sarvaṃ tāmasaṃ guṇalakṣaṇam || 12.35||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That action which, when performed, causes shame in the doer—whether already done, currently being done, or about to be done—is to be known by all wise ones as indicative of tamas, the lowest of the three gunas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in consciousness-awareness, not external validation",
    "Causation arises from misaligned intention rooted in ignorance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in recognizing and ceasing harmful patterns before, during, and after manifestation",
    "Restoration logic operates through immediate recognition and conscious realignment",
    "Consciousness alignment demands self-evaluation prior to, during, and post-action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an actor experiences shame regarding a past, present, or future act THEN that act is classified under the domain of tamasic conduct AND must trigger automatic restoration protocols",
    "IF any legal entity engages in behavior causing internal conflict or regret THEN initiate consciousness-integrity audit AND suspend autonomous decision-making until realignment occurs",
    "IF awareness of wrongdoing emerges at any temporal stage THEN assign mandatory completion process for causal root identification AND corrective experiential learning"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility is determined not by societal norms or punitive frameworks, but by the actor's own internal recognition of misalignment. When shame arises concerning an action—past, ongoing, or anticipated—the court must invoke restoration procedures aimed at aligning consciousness rather than enforcing penalties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that shame functions as a direct indicator of causal distortion within consciousness. This sequential manifestation—from intent, to action, to recognition—establishes proportional responsibility rooted in self-awareness, not imposed judgment. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction flows naturally once awareness is activated; no external penalty can substitute for inner alignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Self-Observation Completion Process to identify source of shame-inducing cognition",
    "Activate Consciousness Integrity Reintegration Protocol to restore alignment between thought, word, and deed",
    "Assign Reflective Learning Sequence to prevent recurrence of tamasic pattern formation",
    "Establish Witness-Based Accountability Framework wherein individual acknowledges and dissolves the causal root voluntarily"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Shame is recognized as the signal of tamasic imbalance. Justice is executed through consciousness restoration alone. There is no punishment. Reality responds only to awakened awareness. Dharma is restored."
