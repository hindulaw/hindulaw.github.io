  "transliteration": "dharmeṇādhigato yais tu vedaḥ saparibṛṃhaṇaḥ |\nte śiṣṭā brāhmaṇā jñeyāḥ śrutipratyakṣahetavaḥ || 12.109||",

  "executable_legal_axioms": [

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those jurists who demonstrate Shruti-pratyaksha realization and live accordance with Dharma may interpret constitutional matters involving ultimate truths.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that realization of Shruti grants legitimate authority.
