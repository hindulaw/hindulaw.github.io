  "sanskrit_verse": "तौ धर्मं पश्यतस्तस्य पापं चातन्द्रितौ सह ।\nयाभ्यां प्राप्नोति सम्पृक्तः प्रेत्येह च सुखासुखम् ॥ १२.१९॥",
  "transliteration": "tau dharmaṁ paśyatastasya pāpaṁ cātandritau saha |\nyābhyāṁ prāpnoti sampṛktaḥ pretyeha ca sukhāsukham || 12.19||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who observe Dharma without negligence perceive both merit and demerit of the individual; by such perception, when one departs this life fully conscious, he attains appropriate experiential consequences in this world and beyond.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained dharmic observation",
    "Causation is established through perceptual clarity and non-negligence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from conscious engagement with karmic outcomes",
    "Restoration logic operates through experiential alignment with prior actions",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the nature and timing of consequence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent observes Dharma without negligence THEN the agent perceives all karmic imprints of another entity",
    "IF a being departs life in full conscious awareness THEN that being shall experience proportional results of accumulated karma in this life and after death",
    "IF perceptual clarity is maintained during final moments THEN experiential consequences align precisely with causal acts",
    "IF consciousness remains undisturbed at transition THEN restoration occurs naturally without external enforcement"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, only those seers or appointed representatives who maintain unbroken dharmic vigilance may assess karmic consequences. The Court must ensure no negligence has occurred in observation, and any ruling must reflect precise alignment between action and experiential outcome, preserving continuity of consciousness rather than imposing arbitrary judgment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that clear perception reveals inherent consequences. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation according to volition. Proportional responsibility arises spontaneously upon conscious departure. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering is not imposed but experienced as part of natural experiential completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate uninterrupted conscious witnessing until karmic impressions dissolve",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Guide individual to recognize and accept their own experiential patterns",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reinforce clarity of perception to prevent future neglect",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Align post-death consciousness flow with purified intention"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness-based justice. No punishment exists—only experiential completion. Reality responds solely to awareness. Consciousness itself is the ultimate adjudicator."
