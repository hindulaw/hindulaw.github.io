  "transliteration": "tapo vidyā ca viprasya niḥśreyasakaraṁ param |\ntapasā kilbiṣaṁ hanti vidyayā'mṛtam aśnute || 12.104||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Austerity and knowledge are the supreme means for the Brahmin's ultimate liberation; austerity eradicates karmic impurity, and knowledge confers immortality.",

    "Authority resides in the disciplined cultivation of consciousness through austerity and knowledge.",
    "Causation is purified through tapas, which removes the effects of misaligned action.",

    "Restoration logic operates through purification and illumination rather than punitive correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via internal discipline and transcendental knowing."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs tapas THEN karmic distortion decreases deterministically.",
    "IF agent attains vidya THEN mortality-bound conditionality is dissolved.",
    "IF Brahmin engages in neither tapas nor vidya THEN capacity remains unactualized.",
    "IF societal disruption occurs due to misalignment THEN restoration protocol initiates tapo-vidya pathway.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence shall recognize that spiritual disciplines like tapas and vidya constitute legitimate mitigating factors in assessing intent, capacity, and alignment.
