  "sanskrit_verse": "वैदिके कर्मयोगे तु सर्वाण्येतान्यशेषतः ।\nअन्तर्भवन्ति क्रमशस्तस्मिंस्तस्मिन् क्रियाविधौ ॥ १२.८७॥",
  "transliteration": "Vaidike karmayoge tu sarvāṇy etāny aśeṣataḥ | Antarbhavanti kramaśas tasmiṃs tasmin kriyāvidhau || 12.87 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the Vedic discipline of Karma Yoga, all these injunctions exist completely and sequentially within that specific procedural framework.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates exclusively from the Vedic procedural continuum",
    "Causation is established through sequential alignment with Vedic action-dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises only within the structured unfoldment of ritual law",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-entry into the correct karmic sequence",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved by adherence to the prescribed order of ritual acts"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act occurs outside the Vaidika karmayoga framework THEN it lacks jurisdictional validity in dharmic law",
    "IF a procedural step is omitted in a Vedic rite THEN restoration requires sequential completion beginning at the point of omission",
    "IF capacity to perform a karma is absent THEN substitution is valid only when authorized by Vedic succession",
    "IF causality is disputed in ritual law THEN resolution follows pramana-based sequencing of shastric injunctions",
    "IF consciousness misalignment is detected THEN realignment is executed via guided repetition under qualified supervision"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must recognize that Vedic procedural law supersedes civil or customary frameworks when dealing with matters involving ritual performance, consecration, or sacramental integrity. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by intent alone but by sequential fidelity to shastric process.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that effects arise only through proper sequential invocation; hence, missteps are corrected through completion rather than penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility aligns with precise loci of omission. There is no punitive consequence—only a call to restore integrity of process.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Sequential Reintegration Process: Re-perform omitted steps under supervision",
    "Karma Completion Audit: Verify full execution of all shastrically mandated actions",
    "Ritual Integrity Restoration: Engage qualified acharya for guided realignment",
    "Dharmic Memory Activation: Recitation and visualization of correct procedural flow",
    "Consciousness Realignment Session: Meditative immersion into the intent of the original injunction"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. The verse is not interpreted but enacted as pure Dharma. Justice is restoration, not punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through alignment with Vedic sequence. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
