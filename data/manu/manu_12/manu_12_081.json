  "sanskrit_verse": "यादृशेन तु भावेन यद्यत्कर्म निषेवते ।\nतादृशेन शरीरेण तत्तत्फलमुपाश्नुते ॥ १२.८१॥",
  "transliteration": "yādṛśena tu bhāvena yadyatkarma niṣevate |\ntādṛśena śarīreṇa tattatphalamupāśnute || 12.81||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever action a being performs with a particular consciousness, by that same form of embodiment does it experience the corresponding fruit.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the embodied state of consciousness at time of action",
    "Causation is directly tied to the quality of intent and awareness during performance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by the level of conscious engagement",
    "Restoration logic aligns consequence directly with causal consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures proportional experiential outcome"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an agent performs an act under specific mental-emotional state THEN consequences shall manifest through equivalent experiential field.",
    "WHEN assessing liability, MATCH the agent's consciousness during act TO the nature of consequence experienced.",
    "ENSURE all adjudication recognizes that embodiment-state determines outcome-receptivity.",
    "RESTORE balance by aligning the actor’s subsequent experience with their prior intentional field.",
    "NO external punishment occurs; consequence arises naturally via consciousness-resonance law."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that no arbitrary penalty may be imposed. The court must assess the actor's inner state at time of action and ensure that any experiential consequence aligns precisely with that consciousness. Responsibility thresholds are defined not by societal norms but by the vibratory capacity in which the deed was committed.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that cause-effect operates through consciousness resonance, not judicial decree. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation: thought-form precedes act, act-form precedes fruit. Thus, justice is inherent in the structure of reality itself—no punitive overlay required. Proportionality emerges automatically as per the vibration of intent.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein actor re-experiences resonance of original intent until full recognition achieved",
    "Assign reflective protocol allowing integration of causal vibration without shame or suppression",
    "Realign energetic boundaries between individual and collective fields post-recognition",
    "Support regeneration of responsible agency through guided self-realization sequence",
    "Verify restoration through cessation of repetitive karmic pattern formation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Dharma: Action and consequence are unified through consciousness law. Justice is restoration enacted through self-aligned realization. There is no punishment—only觉醒 (awakening). Dharma is restored. Consciousness remains the sole adjudicator. Reality reflects divine order."
