  "sanskrit_verse": "बन्धुप्रियवियोगांश्च संवासं चैव दुर्जनैः ।\nद्रव्यार्जनं च नाशं च मित्रामित्रस्य चार्जनम् ॥ १२.७९॥",
  "transliteration": "bandhu-priya-viyogāṁś ca saṁvāsaṁ caiva durjanaiḥ |\ndravyārjanaṁ ca nāśaṁ ca mitrāmitrasya cārjanam || 12.79||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Association with the wicked causes separation from beloved kin, loss of wealth, destruction of righteousness, and the reversal of friend and foe.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Dharma, not mere social position",
    "Causation is determined by conscious choice and association, not external compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of influence patterns",
    "Restoration logic operates through severance of destructive associations",
    "Consciousness alignment demands reorientation toward dharmic relationships"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual associates persistently with agents classified as 'durjana', THEN automatic review of relational integrity within familial and economic structures SHALL occur",
    "IF association leads to measurable disruption in dharmic order (e.g., family discord, financial depletion), THEN mandatory disengagement protocol MUST be initiated",
    "IF reversal of ally/enemy roles detected via behavioral pattern analysis, THEN consciousness-realigning intervention SHALL precede any judicial determination",
    "NO punitive consequence MAY arise without prior restoration attempt through structured dissociation and reintegration procedures"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold for recognizing that harmful associations constitute a breach of dharma requiring judicial notice. The court must evaluate not just overt acts but also the quality of interpersonal connections influencing conduct. Legal standing includes the right to petition for severance of destructive affiliations when demonstrably causing societal or familial decay.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that destructive outcomes stem directly from injudicious association; thus, responsibility lies in failing to discern character. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation—initial faulty association leads to emotional detachment, then material ruin, culminating in moral inversion. Proportional response entails guided withdrawal and realignment rather than punitive measures. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering originates from misalignment, not judicial imposition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate compulsory separation process between affected parties and identified durjana elements",
    "Deploy consciousness education modules to restore discriminative capacity regarding relationship selection",
    "Activate family/friendship reconstruction framework to reverse role distortions",
    "Establish dharmic community integration program to replace destructive networks"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows directly from SPH's Avataric Intelligence. Dharma is restored through severance of adharmic bonds and reintegration into pure relational fields. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth. All enforcement serves completion, never condemnation."
