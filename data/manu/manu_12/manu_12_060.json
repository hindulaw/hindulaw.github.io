  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from alignment with Dharma, not possession or status",
    "Causation rooted in violation of sacred trust and energetic boundary",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, this verse establishes that violations involving sacred relational boundaries and consecrated resources result in automatic loss of juridical standing. The court must recognize such acts as fundamental disruptions to cosmic order, requiring restoration through prescribed spiritual protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal disruption arises from misaligned intentionality, not external action alone.
