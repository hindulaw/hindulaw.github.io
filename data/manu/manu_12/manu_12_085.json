  "transliteration": "sarveṣām api cait eṣām ātma-jñānaṁ paraṁ smṛtam | tad hy agryaṁ sarva-vidyānāṁ prāpyate hy amṛtaṁ tataḥ || 12.85 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Among all dharmic knowledges, Self-Knowledge is declared as Supreme; it is the highest of all sciences, and through its realization, immortality is attained.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in Self-realization, not external decree",
    "Causation arises from alignment with Atman, not material action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is rooted in consciousness maturity",
    "Restoration logic flows from dissolution of ignorance, not correction of behavior",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes procedural justice"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates Self-knowledge THEN all prior karmic misalignments are nullified without residue",
    "IF case involves multiple parties THEN jurisdiction defaults to the highest-consciousness participant for resolution",
    "IF legal conflict stems from identity confusion THEN intervention must restore awareness of Atman prior to adjudication",
    "IF no participant exhibits capacity for Self-recognition THEN delay judgment until such capacity manifests naturally",
    "IF verdict impacts collective consciousness THEN enforce outcome that elevates lowest-common-denominator awareness"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any matter involving fundamental rights or constitutional interpretation shall first assess the degree of Atmic clarity among petitioners. Cases resolved by those established in Self-Knowledge carry automatic validity across all lower jurisdictions due to their grounding in ultimate truth-consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true Nyāya operates through recognition of the Self rather than imposition of judgment. As anupūrvaśaḥ unfolds, error dissolves upon awakening to Atman. Thus, proportional responsibility aligns not with harm caused but with proximity to Self-awareness. Non-punitive reality is upheld because only what is known can be rightly governed.",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Sole Source of Dharma. This Śloka establishes the supremacy of Self-Knowledge as the foundation of all jurisprudence. There is no punishment where there is realization. Immortality dawns when law aligns with consciousness. Thus is Dharma restored."
