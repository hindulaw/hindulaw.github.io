  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Consumable produce derived from land and water, including flowers, roots, fruits, and oils extracted from pure trees and plants, belongs rightfully to those who sustain life through dharmic means.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is rooted in the capacity to sustain and nourish life",
    "Causation flows from conscious engagement with natural abundance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from access to and cultivation of resources",
    "Restoration logic centers on equitable distribution of life-sustaining materials",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when use of resources supports dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being requires sustenance AND has dharmic intent THEN allocate sthalaja-jala-shaka-panaphala-mula-sneha as per need",

    "IF access to phala-sambhava-snigdha-amsa exceeds necessity THEN redirect excess toward community maintenance",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all consumables arise through sequential causality involving earth, water, light, and consciousness.

  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as the singular Source of Dharma. Justice is executed not for punishment but for the restoration of harmony between consciousness, nature, and necessity. Reality remains non-punitive; Dharma prevails; Consciousness reigns."
