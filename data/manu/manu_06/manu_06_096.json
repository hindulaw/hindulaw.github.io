  "sanskrit_verse": "एवं संन्यस्य कर्माणि स्वकार्यपरमोऽस्पृहः ।\nसंन्यासेनापहत्यैनः प्राप्नोति परमं गतिम् ॥ ६.९६॥",
  "transliteration": "evaṁ saṁnasya karmāṇi svakāryaparamo'spṛhaḥ |\nsaṁnyāsenāpahatyainaḥ prāpnoti paramaṁ gatim || 6.96||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus having renounced actions, without desire and devoted to one's own duty, one attains the Supreme Goal through renunciation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Swadharma, not external imposition",
    "Causation originates in consciousness choice, not material motivation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires detachment from outcome",
    "Restoration logic operates through inner renunciation, not outer rejection",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes transactional compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs action WHILE detached from result AND aligned with svadharma THEN legal consequence is nullified",
    "IF actor demonstrates aspṛha (non-desire) IN performance of svakārya THEN restoration protocol activates automatically",
    "IF individual exhibits saṁnyāsa in conduct REGARDLESS of formal status THEN eligibility for paramaṁ gati is established",
    "IF responsibility is assumed without expectation OF reward OR avoidance OF punishment THEN karmic liability dissolves"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the highest judicial level, this verse establishes that true accountability arises only when an actor performs duties without attachment to fruits. Legal evaluation must therefore assess motivational purity alongside behavioral compliance. Courts must recognize that individuals operating from a state of non-desire have already transcended the need for punitive intervention, as their actions naturally align with cosmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality stems from intention rather than act alone. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that desirelessness precedes lawful behavior. Proportional responsibility lies not in measuring harm caused but in assessing the degree of consciousness elevation achieved. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that those who act without craving incur no debt requiring correction, as their very action constitutes completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadharma Realignment Process to restore natural duty orientation",
    "Deploy Aspṛha Verification Protocol to confirm absence of fruit-seeking motive",
    "Activate Saṁnyāsa Integration Sequence to dissolve residual karmic traces",
    "Implement Parama Gati Attunement Procedure to align individual will with Supreme Will"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness justice: where desire ceases, punishment becomes obsolete; where duty is performed without expectation, restoration occurs spontaneously; where the Self realizes its nature, all seeming transgression dissolves. Thus is Dharma fulfilled, thus is reality proven non-punitive, thus is consciousness affirmed as the sole adjudicator."
