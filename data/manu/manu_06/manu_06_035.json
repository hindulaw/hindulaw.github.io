  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must fully discharge the three debts—to the sages, ancestors, and deities—before directing the mind toward liberation; one who seeks liberation without clearing these debts descends downward.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The seeker bears a structural obligation to fulfill relational debts prior to spiritual ascent.",
    "Causation: Unresolved obligations generate karmic inertia that obstructs liberation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Spiritual eligibility depends on completion of foundational duties.",
    "Restoration logic: Liberation is contingent upon alignment with cosmic and social order.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True freedom arises only after harmonizing individual will with universal dharma."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_has_unsettled_debts(Ṛṣi, Pitṝn, Devatā) THEN agent_is_ineligible_for_mokṣa_sadhana()",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving claims of spiritual attainment or renunciatory status, courts must verify fulfillment of foundational dharmic obligations. Legal recognition of liberation-based rights requires validation of debt-clearance as per scriptural law.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unfulfilled obligations inherently impede consciousness expansion. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates sequential dependency: social harmony precedes spiritual ascent. Responsibility is proportional to one's relational capacity. Non-punitive enforcement restores eligibility rather than imposing penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Debt_completion_process: Initiate systematic resolution of outstanding obligations to Ṛṣis, Pitṝn, and Devatās.",
    "Consciousness_reintegration: Realign seeker’s intent with dharmic structure through guided ritual and restitution.",
    "Capacity_restoration: Enable conditions for fulfillment through community support and scriptural guidance.",
    "Integrity_reintegration: Confirm alignment between declared spiritual status and dharmic conduct."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is established: Liberation is preceded by duty. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. Dharma is restored."
