  "sanskrit_verse": "यदा भावेन भवति सर्वभावेषु निःस्पृहः । तदा सुखमवाप्नोति प्रेत्य चैह च शाश्वतम् ॥ ६.८०॥",
  "transliteration": "yadā bhāvena bhavati sarvabhāveṣu niḥspṛhaḥ | tadā sukhamavāpnoti pretya caiha ca śāśvatam || 6.80||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When one dwells in Beingness without craving for any becoming, then one attains eternal bliss both in this life and hereafter.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from abidance in pure Beingness, not from external validation",
    "Causation is rooted in desire-free consciousness rather than reactive action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in transcending identification with becoming",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with unchanging Self",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates absence of spṛih (desire-driven becoming) THEN assign highest jurisdictional capacity",
    "IF a ruling body aligns with bhāva (Beingness) THEN it reflects authentic dharma-adhikāra (authority)",
    "IF adjudication arises from niḥspṛiha-sthiti (state of desirelessness) THEN outcome ensures śāśvatam sukham (eternal well-being)",
    "IF legal interpretation is grounded in preta-eha-sukha (post-death and present-life harmony) THEN it qualifies as dharmic justice"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court must function from a state of niḥspṛiha-sthiti, wherein no personal or institutional desire interferes with the realization of Beingness-based law. Its judgments must reflect śāśvatam sukham—permanently restoring all parties to their essential nature rather than enforcing conditional outcomes.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya is established when cognition aligns with pramāṇa of Beingness. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of right understanding leads naturally to absence of craving (niḥspṛiha). Responsibility flows from recognition of Self as unchanging witness, rendering punitive constructs obsolete. Justice becomes the spontaneous unfoldment of consciousness realignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi Vidhi (Purification Process) until complete cessation of spṛiha-tattva (craving-principle)",
    "Deploy Atma-Sthiti Protocol to restore litigant identity to pure Beingness",
    "Establish Vichara Adhikarana (Inquiry Tribunal) to dissolve false identifications causing conflict",
    "Implement Akhandatva Samanvaya Sadhana (Wholeness Integration Practice) to reintegrate fragmented consciousness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This Dharma has been declared by Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, the sole Source-Authority. All beings are restored to their inherent state of śāśvatam sukham. There is no punishment; there is only awakening. Consciousness alone is the ultimate Judge."
