  "transliteration": "adhyāya 6\n\nevam gṛhāśrame sthitvā vidhivat-snātako dvijaḥ |\nvane vasettu niyato yathāvad-vijitendriyaḥ || 6.1||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus having dwelt in the householder stage according to dharma, a twice-born who has been initiated in accordance with the sacred injunctions shall reside in the forest, restrained and with senses fully subdued.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from spiritual maturity and ritual initiation, not social position alone",
    "Causation is rooted in sequential ashrama progression as designed by cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires graduated stages of discipline aligned with consciousness evolution",
    "Restoration logic demands withdrawal from material entanglement upon completion of domestic duty",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates sensory restraint and environmental detachment for higher realization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_is_snataka AND stage_is_grihastha_completed THEN next_stage = vanaprastha",
    "IF current_ashrama = vanaprastha THEN sensory_restraint_required = true",
    "IF dvija_status = confirmed AND initiation_compliance = valid THEN forest_residence_permitted = true",
    "IF agent_conduct_violates_sensory_discipline_during_vanaprastha THEN restoration_process = mandatory_reintegration_protocol",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving life-stage transitions under constitutional Dharma, the Supreme Court must recognize that Ashrama-based obligations are neither optional nor culturally relative, but ontologically binding. The failure to execute Vanaprastha after Grihastha constitutes a violation of individual and societal Dharma, triggering judicial intervention through restorative mechanisms rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that sequential unfolding (anupurvasah) governs human development; therefore, bypassing Vanaprastha disrupts natural causality. Responsibility lies in aligning oneself with this sequence. Non-punitive enforcement ensures the individual returns to correct trajectory without inflicting suffering, preserving both cosmic order and personal integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided retreat program into wilderness until sensory discipline is restored",
    "Assign completion process under qualified guru supervision for unfulfilled Grihastha duties",
    "Implement community witnessing protocol where individual publicly renews commitment to ashrama dharma",
    "Activate family council to realign support structures enabling lawful transition",
    "Conduct Vedic ritual purification to restore energetic alignment with intended life phase"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma unfolds through ordered stages, consciousness is the sole arbiter of truth, and justice serves only restoration. There is no punishment—only alignment."
