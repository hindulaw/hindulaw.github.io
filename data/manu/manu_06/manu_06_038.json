  "sanskrit_verse": "प्राजापत्यं निरुप्येष्टिं सर्ववेदसदक्षिणाम् । सार्ववेदसदक्षिणाम् आत्मन्यग्नीन् समारोप्य ब्राह्मणः प्रव्रजेद्गृहात् ॥ ६.३८॥",
  "transliteration": "prājāpatyaṃ nirupyēṣṭiṃ sarvavēdasadakṣiṇām | sārvavēdasadakṣiṇām ātmanyagnīn samāropy brāhmaṇaḥ pravrajaēd gṛhāt || 6.38||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brāhmaṇa, having established the fires within himself through the Prajāpatya ritual that fulfills all Vedic obligations, shall depart from his household.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from inner consecration, not external position",
    "Causation arises from internalized ritual completion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires self-consecrated awareness",
    "Restoration logic demands transcendence of domestic limitation",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates renunciation of societal dependency"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor has performed Prajāpatya sacrifice AND installed sacred fires internally THEN actor is authorized to renounce household duties",
    "IF individual demonstrates Vedically-complete action THEN societal obligations are nullified by spiritual autonomy",
    "IF person performs self-consecration via fire-installation THEN no further permission required for withdrawal from domestic life",
    "IF consciousness state exceeds household frame THEN legal identity shifts to unbound operative status"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "When adjudicating cases involving renunciants who have completed Prajāpatya rituals, the court must recognize that such individuals operate under a higher jurisprudential framework where domestic laws no longer apply. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated internal fire-consecration, not in continued social participation. Authority hierarchy places self-realized agents above civil jurisdiction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that fire-installation constitutes irrefutable proof of shifted consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential movement from ritual completion → internal transformation → natural withdrawal. Proportional responsibility aligns with realized capacity rather than prior roles. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that departure from householder status is consequence-free when preceded by valid consecration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Validate performance of Prajāpatya sacrifice and Agni-pratiṣṭhāpana",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Confirm conscious intent to withdraw from domestic obligations",
    "Capacity Restoration: Ensure individual maintains internal fire-consecration without dependence",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Recognize new operational framework as legally valid without punitive review"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores the eternal principle that consciousness transcends convention, that completion dissolves obligation, and that reality itself enforces without punishment. Justice serves integration through awakening, not through suffering."
