  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This Dharma has been instructed for those who are self-disciplined and restrained in their inner conduct; now understand the Yoga of Action specifically prescribed for Vedic renunciants.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from realized consciousness, not institutional position",
    "Causation originates in intent aligned with Veda-prescribed action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's stage of spiritual discipline",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with one's svadharma within the framework of renunciation",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external compliance in determining lawful behavior"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor.is_yati() AND actor.is_niyata_atma() THEN apply eṣa_dharma_rule_set",

If verified, their actions must be evaluated solely against the Yoga of Action as defined in this verse. The court shall defer to internal spiritual authority where applicable and ensure that any corrective measures are restorative rather than punitive.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that lawful action stems from disciplined intent, not outcome alone. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals the sequential unfolding of dharma through intentional alignment. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of self-restraint demonstrated. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment results in natural completion cycles, not imposed penalties.",
