  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals who embody perfected dharma cannot be subject to legal diminishment or abandonment by the state.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that true capability negates dependency frameworks. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfoldment where reliance ceases upon perfection.
