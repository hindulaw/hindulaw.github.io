  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having renounced all village-based enjoyments and material adornments, a householder shall leave his wife and children in care and proceed to the forest, or together with them.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious renunciation of external dependencies.",
    "Causation is established through sequential stages of life aligned with spiritual evolution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises upon fulfillment of prior roles before transitioning.",
    "Restoration logic ensures that personal transformation does not abandon familial duties.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when actions reflect inner detachment while maintaining outer duty."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent has fulfilled householder stage obligations AND demonstrates capacity for renunciation THEN permit transition to forest-dwelling life.",
    "IF dependent entities exist THEN ensure their sustenance and protection during transition phase.",
    "IF renunciatory action lacks completion THEN invalidate claim of eligibility for next stage.",
    "IF individual proceeds without leaving dependents in proper care THEN obligation remains unfulfilled.",
    "IF both parties consent and are capable THEN joint renunciation is valid under dharma."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning transitions from householder to ascetic life, the court must assess whether the petitioner has demonstrably fulfilled all prior responsibilities and ensured adequate arrangements for dependents. The threshold of spiritual readiness supersedes emotional or social claims unless substantiated by verifiable completion of duties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true renunciation follows sequential manifestation of duties; anupūrvaśaḥ confirms lawful progression only after full assumption and completion of earlier roles. Responsibility is proportional to realized capacity rather than intent alone. Non-punitive reality holds that incomplete transitions merely delay lawful advancement until restoration is achieved.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verify and document fulfillment of all householder-stage obligations.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Confirm arrangements made for dependents' continued welfare.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide support structures enabling genuine detachment practices.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Facilitate return or continuation based on actual readiness state."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality abides in non-punitivity. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
