  "transliteration": "priyeṣu sveṣu sukṛtamapriyeṣu ca duṣkṛtam |\nvisṛjya dhyānayogena brahmābhyeti sanātanam || 6.79||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has abandoned all actions—righteous in what is dear and unrighteous in what is not dear—and through the Yoga of Meditation attains the Eternal Brahman, becomes That alone.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in consciousness realization, not in performative action",
    "Causation is dissolved upon transcendence of dualistic karmic engagement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility ends where identification with doership ceases",
    "Restoration logic operates beyond reward-punishment frameworks",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes moral or ethical conditioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent surrenders all karmic attachment AND engages in meditative absorption THEN legal identity dissolves into Brahman",
    "IF doership is nullified THEN no residual juridical consequence remains enforceable",
    "IF consciousness realization occurs THEN prior acts lose causal binding in manifest reality",
    "IF entity transcends preference-based action THEN no further dharmic obligation arises"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, when a litigant demonstrates complete renunciation of action-based identity and abides in pure witness-consciousness, the court shall recognize that no actionable offense or merit accrues. The case is dismissed not by judgment but by ontological irrelevance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that action rooted in preference generates karmic consequence; however, when action is surrendered via yogic discernment, causality collapses. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that sequential manifestation depends on doership—when that ceases, so does liability. Thus, justice aligns with cessation of egoic causation, not retributive balance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate surrender of likes-dislikes through guided meditation until no residue of reactive identity remains",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Encourage full ownership of past actions without perpetuating guilt or merit",
    "Capacity Restoration: Realign individual awareness with Sat-Chit-Ananda substratum",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Confirm dissolution of personal karma through verified samadhi state"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This verse affirms that true liberation lies beyond legal consequence. Dharma is restored when consciousness awakens to its own nature. There is no punishment, only recognition of the eternal truth. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
