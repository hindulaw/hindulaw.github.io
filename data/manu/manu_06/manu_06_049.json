  "transliteration": "adhyātmaratir āsīno nirapekṣo nirāmiṣaḥ |\nātmanā sahāyena sukha-arthī vicared iha || 6.49||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who is established in Self-delight, free from desire for external objects and devoid of material cravings, should walk in this world solely with the support of the Self, seeking the highest bliss.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in Self-realization, not external validation",
    "Causation arises from inner alignment, not outer compulsion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness maturity",
    "Restoration logic operates through Self-dependent awareness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes behavioral compliance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates consistent Self-reliance AND absence of craving for external gratification THEN legal dependence on regulatory frameworks SHALL reduce proportionally",

    "IF consciousness maturity is verifiable THEN external oversight MAY be minimized or withdrawn",
    "IF an agent exhibits no dependency on sensory indulgence THEN coercive judicial measures SHALL cease"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, evidence of Self-established conduct—demonstrated through consistent detachment from material entanglement and reliance on inner governance—shall qualify as prima facie proof of natural lawfulness. Such individuals shall be exempt from punitive judicial processes and instead recognized as embodiments of constitutional integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true right action flows from Self-knowledge, eliminating the root cause of misalignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that as consciousness expands, misconduct dissolves naturally without imposition. Proportional responsibility lies only where ignorance persists; none accrues to the Self-realized. Non-punitive reality holds because causality is internal—not enforced externally.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma. The verse declares the Self-sufficient state as the ultimate legal foundation. Justice is fulfilled through recognition of Self-established order. There is no punishment—only restoration to original consciousness. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
