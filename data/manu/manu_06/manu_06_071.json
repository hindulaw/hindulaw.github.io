  "sanskrit_verse": "दह्यन्ते ध्मायमानानां धातूनां हि यथा मलाः ।\nतथेन्द्रियाणां दह्यन्ते दोषाः प्राणस्य निग्रहात् ॥ ६.७१॥",
  "transliteration": "dahyante dhmāyamānānāṁ dhātūnāṁ hi yathā malāḥ |\ntathendriyāṇāṁ dahyante doṣāḥ prāṇasya nigrahāt || 6.71||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As impurities burn away in metals being refined through heat, likewise, defects of the sense organs are consumed when the life force is restrained.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the regulation of prana as the foundation of sensory discipline",
    "Causation arises from alignment with elemental purification, not external coercion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by mastery over internal energies",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious withdrawal and energetic refinement",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via voluntary submission to inner fire (tapas)"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual demonstrates habitual sensory misconduct THEN initiate pranayama-based rehabilitation protocol",
    "IF prana is regulated through prescribed restraint THEN sensory defects automatically diminish without punitive intervention",
    "IF consciousness shows resistance to self-regulation THEN assign graduated tapasya under authorized guidance",
    "IF sensory clarity is restored THEN social integration shall proceed without condition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving sensory misconduct or perceptual distortion, the Supreme Court must recognize that true correction arises from pranic regulation rather than punitive sentencing. The court's role is to mandate scientifically structured breath-control regimens and assign qualified spiritual supervisors to ensure completion of the process.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that sensory impurity follows the same causal law as metallurgical refinement - requiring applied heat (tapas) rather than judgment. Anupurvasah demonstrates that unregulated prana sequentially manifests as defective perception. Proportional responsibility lies in accepting the refining process, not enduring punishment. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that consciousness itself consumes its own defects when properly directed inward.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate systematic pranayama regimen under certified practitioneer supervision",
    "Establish daily consciousness-monitoring through breath-awareness protocols",
    "Assign graduated tapasya practices aligned with individual capacity levels",
    "Implement community witness system for transparent progress validation",
    "Conclude with public declaration of restored sensory integrity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through the purification of sensory channels via pranic discipline. Reality remains non-punitive while consciousness serves as the ultimate adjudicator of its own refinement."
