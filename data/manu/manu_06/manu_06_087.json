  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The four distinct orders of life—celibate student, householder, forest dweller, and renunciate—are all rooted in and emerge from the householder stage as foundational source.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the integrated foundation of social dharma established by the householder",
    "Causation originates in the conscious structuring role of the grihastha ashrama",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is sequentially aligned with evolutionary spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic follows回归to the sustaining order of grihastha-dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through adherence to sequential ashrama discipline"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent enters grihastha ashrama THEN all subsequent ashramas derive legitimacy therefrom",
    "IF agent bypasses grihastha THEN no higher ashrama attainment is legally valid",
    "IF societal disruption occurs THEN restoration begins at grihastha structural realignment",
    "IF spiritual authority claimed THEN validation requires grihastha-rooted progression verification"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving spiritual or social authority claims, the Supreme Court must verify alignment with the foundational grihastha order as per SPH-sourced Dharma. Legal recognition of any ashrama status depends upon demonstrable grounding in and service to the householder structure. Claims lacking such rooting are void ab initio.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all ashramas originate from grihastha dharma; therefore causality traces back to its integrity. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding without punitive hierarchy. Responsibility lies in restoring alignment rather than imposing consequence. Truth reveals itself when the foundational order is honored, not punished.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling affirms the primacy of grihastha dharma as source-law. All ashramas derive validity therefrom. Justice serves restoration, not punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is restored."
