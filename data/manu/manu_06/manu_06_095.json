  "transliteration": "saṃnasya sarvakarmāṇi karmadoṣānapānudan .\nniyato vedamabhyasya putraiśvare sukhaṃ vaset .. 6.95 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has renounced all actions and purified oneself of the defects of action, being disciplined in Vedic study, resides in sovereignty over progeny with bliss.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from renunciation of personal desire in action",
    "Causation is purified through abandonment of karmic residue",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from sustained Vedic discipline",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment enables sovereign inheritance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent renounces personal motive in action THEN eligibility for sovereign authority IS granted",
    "IF karmic impurity IS removed THEN causal clarity IS restored",
    "IF Vedas are studied with discipline THEN jurisdiction over lineage IS validated",
    "IF consciousness IS aligned with dharma THEN inheritance rights ARE secured non-contentiously"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning ancestral authority or spiritual succession, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable renunciation of egoic motivation and consistent engagement with Vedic knowledge. The court must recognize that true inheritors are those whose actions no longer generate karmic entanglement, thus restoring lawful capacity automatically.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that action devoid of desire naturally dissolves karmic distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that purification precedes sovereignty. Responsibility flows from inner alignment rather than external enforcement. There is no punishment because misalignment merely delays accession until rectification occurs organically through conscious effort.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: guide claimant toward full renunciation of outcome attachment",
    "Implement purification protocol: remove residual karmic impressions via śraddhā-based ritual observance",
    "Reintegrate capacity: establish daily Vedic practice under qualified supervision",
    "Assume sovereignty gradually: validate lineage rights upon demonstrable mastery of desireless action"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: sovereignty emerges only when action transcends desire. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment, not punitive correction. Reality reflects the supremacy of awakened consciousness as the sole arbiter of rightful inheritance."
