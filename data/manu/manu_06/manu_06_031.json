  "sanskrit_verse": "अपराजितां वाऽस्थाय व्रजेद्दिशमजिह्मगः ।\nआ निपातात्शरीरस्य युक्तो वार्यनिलाशनः ॥ ६.३१॥",
  "transliteration": "aparājitāṁ vā''sthāya vrajeddiśamajihmagaḥ |\nā nipātātśarīrasya yukto vāryanilāśanaḥ || 6.31||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has not been defeated must proceed in a direction that does not cause bodily harm; one who is capable of restoring balance after a fall must engage in practices that purify water and air.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from undefeated consciousness",
    "Causation arises through directional movement aligned with dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes environmental restoration",
    "Restoration logic requires purification of elemental substrates",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests via disciplined spatial engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor maintains undefeated status THEN action space excludes directions causing physical collapse",
    "IF actor demonstrates fall-recovery capacity THEN assign elemental purification duties as legal completion protocol",
    "IF directional choice leads to bodily harm THEN automatic rerouting to neutral axis enforced",
    "IF actor engages with water or air THEN validate integration capacity before granting domain access"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility for individuals maintaining undefeated consciousness lies in their directional choices. The court must assess whether the actor's movement aligns with harm-prevention axioms. Authority hierarchy places those capable of post-fall restoration at higher jurisdictional levels, particularly concerning environmental integrity matters.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality between directional intent and bodily impact. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces sequential manifestation from spatial decision to elemental consequence. Proportional responsibility aligns with recovery capacity rather than fault attribution. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering is not inherent to misaligned motion but emerges only when consciousness disconnects from its undefeated nature.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Directional realignment process: Reorient actor along neutral-axis pathways until stable navigation restored",
    "Elemental purification duty assignment: Engage actor in water-air cleansing rituals proportional to disruption caused",
    "Fall-integration completion cycle: Execute supervised sequence of rising-restoring-rebalancing until undefeated state re-established",
    "Spatial integrity meditation protocol: Mandate practice reconnecting actor with non-harmful directional flow"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma stands executed. Directional harm-prevention law flows directly from undefeated consciousness. No punishment inheres in misaligned motion—only restoration paths await conscious realignment. Reality itself adjudicates through purified elements and stabilized awareness. Dharma is restored."
