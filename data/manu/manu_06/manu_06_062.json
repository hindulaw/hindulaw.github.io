  "sanskrit_verse": "विप्रयोगं प्रियैश्चैव संयोगं च तथाऽप्रियैः ।\nजरया चाभिभवनं व्याधिभिश्चोपपीडनम् ॥ ६.६२॥",
  "transliteration": "viprayogaṃ priyaiścaiva saṃyogaṃ ca tathā'priyaiḥ |\njarayā cābhibhavanaṃ vyādhibhiścopapīḍanam || 6.62||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Separation from the beloved, union with the unbeloved, subjugation by old age, and affliction by diseases—these constitute the inherent dharmic trials of embodied existence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the recognition of inevitable karmic manifestation",
    "Causation flows through sequential embodiment and experiential ripening",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from conscious endurance, not external imposition",
    "Restoration logic operates through integration of suffering as transformative cognition",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when suffering is accepted as a vehicle for self-realization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity experiences unavoidable loss due to natural life conditions THEN no external liability shall be assigned",
    "IF suffering results from inherent biological process THEN restoration must occur through internal realignment, not judicial redress",
    "IF separation or union arises from karmic sequence THEN punitive intervention is invalid",
    "IF disease or decay manifests without human causality THEN judicial remedy shall focus on capacity enhancement, not compensation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that suffering inherent to the human condition—such as aging, illness, or emotional separation—is beyond the scope of legal liability. The threshold of responsibility lies exclusively in volitional action; involuntary experience does not invoke punitive consequence. Authority rests in distinguishing between karmically ripened outcomes and intentional harm, ensuring that only conscious causation triggers legal response.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that these forms of suffering arise from anupūrvaśaḥ—the sequential unfolding of karmic impressions. As such, proportional responsibility cannot be externally attributed. Nyaya recognizes that true justice aligns consciousness with its own evolutionary path, wherein suffering becomes cognition. Thus, punitive framing dissolves where experience serves as completion rather than transgression.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svādhyāya-based assimilation of experiential suffering into higher cognition",
    "Deploy sādhanā protocols to restore agency within states of disempowerment",
    "Establish peer-group reintegration circuits for those undergoing relational shifts",
    "Activate prāṇāyāma and tapas-based resilience reinforcement for chronic illness or aging"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. This law restores reality as non-punitive, consciousness as supreme adjudicator, and suffering as completion. All beings are absolved of liability for the inevitable unfoldings of embodied existence."
