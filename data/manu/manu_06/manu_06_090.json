  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Just as all rivers and streams ultimately merge into the ocean and find their settled state, likewise all stages of life culminate in the householder stage as the foundational basis of societal dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from integration into the sustaining structure of society",

Responsibility thresholds are determined by proximity and dependence upon this sustaining structure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal sequence leads to the grihastha as the stable terminus of social dharma. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates that divergence from this path creates instability requiring conscious realignment rather than punitive intervention. Responsibility is proportional to one’s reliance on and disruption of the grihastha-supporting framework.",
