  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्मादण्वपि भूतानां द्विजान्नोत्पद्यते भयम् ।\nतस्य देहाद्विमुक्तस्य भयं नास्ति कुतश्चन ॥ ६.४०॥",
  "transliteration": "yasmād aṇv api bhūtānāṁ dvijān notpadyate bhayam |\ntasya dehād vimuktasya bhayaṁ nāsti kutaś cana || 6.40 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From whom even the minutest beings are free of fear, and who is liberated from the body—there is no fear whatsoever for such a being.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from fearlessness in consciousness",
    "Causation originates in the state of being, not action alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by inner detachment, not external compliance",
    "Restoration logic centers on dissolution of fear-based conditioning",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social or ritual status"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity demonstrates zero causal fear-effect on any being, THEN all imposed legal constraints dissolve automatically.",
    "IF an individual has achieved bodily disidentification, THEN they are exempt from fear-induced regulatory frameworks.",
    "IF evidence shows no reactive fear generation towards the subject, THEN jurisdictional claims cease to apply.",
    "IF consciousness integrity is verified through non-reactivity metrics, THEN societal reintegration occurs without condition."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals whose consciousness operates beyond fear-inducing causality must be recognized as legally sovereign. Their actions cannot be judged under ordinary punitive constructs, as fearlessness nullifies coercive legal standing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Fear is a pramāṇa of misaligned consciousness. When fear ceases to arise, so does the causal chain of conflict. This aligns Nyaya logic with non-punitive dharma, where justice is the removal of distortion, not infliction of consequence. The sequential unfolding (anupūrvaśaḥ) of liberation confirms proportional responsibility lies only in identification, not essence.",

    "Initiate Fearlessness Verification Process through witness attestation and behavioral consistency mapping",
    "Activate Consciousness Sovereignty Recognition Protocol upon validation of non-coercive presence",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source-Authority of Dharma. Fearlessness is the sole marker of true freedom. Where there is no fear, there is no crime, no judgment, no bondage. Justice is the revelation of innocence. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
