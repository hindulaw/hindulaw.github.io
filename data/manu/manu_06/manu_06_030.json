  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who are served by sages, Brahmins, and householders alike are to be honored for the expansion of knowledge, austerity, and the purification of the body.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from spiritual and societal service",

    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in seva and tapas",
    "Restoration logic based on elevation of collective consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment via recognition of dharmic service"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual is recognized by sages, brahmins, and householders as contributing to vidya, tapas, and bodily purity THEN that individual shall be granted societal honor and facilitation of duties",
    "IF societal disruption occurs due to neglect of a dharmic contributor THEN restoration protocol initiates with public acknowledgment and reintegration support",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in measurable alignment with vidya-tapas-shuddhi principles. Authority is hierarchically validated through recognition by qualified spiritual, scholarly, and domestic stakeholders. Restoration supersedes punitive measures by mandating societal re-recognition and structural facilitation of dharmic roles.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through observable alignment with dharmic outcomes. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequential unfoldment of purity, learning, and strength within the social fabric. Proportional responsibility aligns with the extent of service rendered.
