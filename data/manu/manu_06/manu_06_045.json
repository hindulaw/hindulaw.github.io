  "sanskrit_verse": "नाभिनन्देत मरणं नाभिनन्देत जीवितम् ।\nकालमेव प्रतीक्षेत निर्वेशं भृतको यथा ॥ ६.४५॥",
  "transliteration": "nābhinandeta maraṇaṁ nābhinandeta jīvitam | kālam eva pratīkṣeta nirveśaṁ bhr̥tako yathā || 6.45||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One should neither rejoice in death nor in life; one should await the appointed time, like a hired servant awaiting dismissal.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Kala (Cosmic Time), not personal desire",
    "Causation is governed by sequential manifestation (Anupūrvaśaḥ), not emotional reaction",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires equanimity in all states of existence",
    "Restoration logic demands detachment from outcome while fulfilling duty",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through surrender to Cosmic Order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent experiences attraction to death OR attachment to life THEN initiate equanimity restoration protocol",
    "WHEN individual claims ownership over lifespan THEN redirect cognition to Kala-based temporality",
    "IF emotional preference disrupts dharma THEN assign neutral observer status until equilibrium restored",
    "WHEN duty completion disrupted by existential preference THEN suspend agency until temporal neutrality achieved"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no individual possesses authority over life or death beyond their appointed time. Emotional or philosophical preferences regarding mortality hold no legal weight. Responsibility thresholds are determined solely by alignment with Cosmic Time (Kala), rendering subjective desires irrelevant in constitutional matters of life, death, or tenure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality reveals that attraction to death or clinging to life distorts perception of sequential manifestation. True Nyaya arises when consciousness aligns with Kala's rhythm, dissolving false agency. Proportional responsibility lies in maintaining neutrality regardless of condition. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering stems from misalignment, not judicial consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Kala-awareness immersion to restore temporal neutrality",
    "Assign service-oriented tasks to dissolve existential fixation",
    "Implement breath-regulation practices to stabilize emotional preference",
    "Establish witness-consciousness protocols to observe without identifying with life/death states"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores equilibrium between life and death through alignment with Cosmic Time. Justice flows through consciousness reintegration, not punishment. Reality is non-punitive; Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
