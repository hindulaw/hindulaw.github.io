  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who remains unattached in pleasures, lives grounded in Earth's stability, takes shelter without ownership, and dwells at the root of trees—such a Brahmacari embodies the state of pure abidance.",

    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection with foundational consciousness.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when desire-driven action ceases."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals whose conduct reflects complete absence of possessive intent and sensual indulgence are to be accorded a fundamental exemption from punitive frameworks.
