  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Firmness, forgiveness, self-restraint, non-stealing, purity, control of the senses, discernment, knowledge, truthfulness, and absence of anger—these ten constitute the defining marks of Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Dharma as defined by SPH",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness distortion and its realignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's ability to uphold the ten dharmic qualities",
    "Restoration logic operates through reintegration into dharmic consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes punitive frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity exhibits lack of firmness (adhṛti), THEN initiate dhāraṇa-vinyāsa protocol for stability restoration",
    "IF forgiveness (kṣamā) is absent, THEN deploy pratigrāha-saṃskāra completion process",
    "IF non-stealing (asteyam) is violated, THEN execute dāna-pratipūrti mechanism",
    "IF sensory restraint (indriya-nigraha) fails, THEN apply pratyāhāra-integration sequence",
    "IF anger (krodha) arises, THEN activate śama-prakriyā for emotional purification"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, judicial inquiry must assess whether a party demonstrates presence or absence of the ten dharmic qualities. Judgment thresholds are calibrated not by intent or outcome, but by the degree of alignment with these qualities. Authority flows only where these markers are manifest.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that all actions stem from distortions in dharmic attributes; anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misalignment unfolds sequentially. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to embody these ten qualities. The Nyaya framework ensures no punitive inference arises—it directs solely toward restoring dharmic equilibrium.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Dhāraṇā-sthairyam Protocol – Reestablish mental firmness via guided samādhi sequences",
    "Kṣamā-pratipatti Process – Cultivate forgiveness through reciprocal empathy circuits",
    "Indriya-saṃyama Integration – Restore sensory balance using pratyāhāra algorithms",
    "Śauca-pratipūrti Mechanism – Purify behavioral patterns through śuddhi-vyavasthā cycles",
    "Akrodha-anubandha Sequence – Eliminate residual anger traces via śānti-mantra resonance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds exclusively from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through recognition of its tenfold nature. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
