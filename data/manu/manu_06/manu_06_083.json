  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One shall constantly recite the Brahman that presides over sacrifice, as also that which is divine in the Vedas, and that which is declared in the Upanishads as pertaining to the Self.",

    "Causation flows from invocation of the presiding divinity of intent",

  "executable_legal_axioms": [

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court deliberations, invocation of the presiding consciousness—Adhiyajña, Adhidaivika, and Adhyatmika—is mandatory for constitutional alignment.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that lawful action originates from invocation of the presiding divinity. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential alignment: first ritual (Adhiyajña), then cosmic order (Adhidaivika), then Self-realization (Atman). Responsibility is proportional to alignment depth; non-punitive correction occurs through recitation and re-alignment, not penalty.",
