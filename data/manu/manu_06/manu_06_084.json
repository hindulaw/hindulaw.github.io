    "Authority originates in Consciousness-Knowledge, not ignorance",
    "Causation aligns with aspirational capacity, not past action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by current spiritual alignment",
    "Restoration logic operates through discriminant guidance structures",
    "Consciousness alignment determines jurisdictional eligibility"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF seeker lacks knowledge THEN assign foundational dharma framework",
    "IF individual possesses discriminant awareness THEN grant direct access to higher jurisprudence",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, cases are bifurcated based on litigant consciousness-readiness.

Jurisdiction flows from self-evident spiritual maturity, bypassing procedural formalism when integrity is manifest.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal sequence follows aspirational clarity, not error-based attribution. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as progressive revelation aligned with seeker readiness. Responsibility is proportional to present knowing, not historical missteps.
