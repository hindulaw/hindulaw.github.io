  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must offer separately the seasonal oblations—spring and autumn—with pure grains and cooked rice-balls, collected personally by the sacrificer in accordance with scriptural procedure.",

Intent, personal involvement, timing, and material purity constitute thresholds of legal recognition for such practices.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that correct action follows śabda-pramāṇa (scriptural testimony). Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential observance leads to desired result.
