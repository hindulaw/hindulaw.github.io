  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has purified immediately, or one who has accumulated purification over a month, or one who has done so over six months — all such persons are equally purified when the completion of dharma is aligned with consciousness.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the immediacy and integrity of conscious action",
    "Causation aligns with the sequential unfolding of dharmic realization",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on awareness at the time of action",
    "Restoration logic operates through reintegration with pure consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines equivalence among varying temporal efforts"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (purification_action.intention = true AND consciousness_state.at_time_of_action >= threshold_of_clarity) THEN legal_status = purified",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that varying durations of corrective conduct yield equal juridical validity when rooted in authentic consciousness transformation. The court must assess not duration alone, but the integrity and clarity of awareness during the restorative process.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that purification arises from causal alignment with satya, not temporal metrics. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential awakening of dharma-consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to觉醒 level, not effort span. Non-punitive reality holds because only consciousness adjudicates truth.",
