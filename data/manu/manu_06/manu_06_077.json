  "transliteration": "jarāśokasamāviṣṭaṃ rogāyatanamāturam |\nrajasvalamanityaṃ ca bhūtāvāsamimaṃ tyajet || 6.77 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must abandon a dwelling that is overtaken by old age, grief, disease, maternal distress, menstrual impurity, and impermanence — for it is no longer fit for sustaining dharmic life-force.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the fitness of environment to sustain dharma",
    "Causation arises from alignment between space and consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility includes maintaining purity of habitation",
    "Restoration logic requires removal from deteriorating conditions",
    "Consciousness alignment demands abandonment of spaces that weaken spiritual infrastructure"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF dwelling exhibits signs of decay, illness, emotional disturbance, or ritual impurity THEN resident must vacate within seven days",
    "IF habitation fails to support clarity, health, and spiritual coherence THEN occupancy is automatically suspended",
    "IF individual remains in unfit dwelling beyond threshold THEN access to communal dharmic resources is restricted until relocation occurs"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning public welfare and constitutional order, if any institutional framework becomes a source of chronic disorder, contamination, or misalignment with foundational dharma, then its function must be reviewed and potentially dissolved by higher judicial authority to restore societal equilibrium.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that environmental degradation directly affects consciousness; thus, causal sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ) necessitates withdrawal rather than correction through force. Responsibility lies not in blame but in recognition of unsuitability. The action aligns with non-punitive reality because the focus is on realigning presence, not punishing absence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process: assess structural and energetic integrity of living space",
    "Assume responsibility protocol: individual undertakes conscious departure without resentment",
    "Restore capacity: provide alternative dwelling aligned with dharmic principles",
    "Reintegrate integrity: perform purification rites upon entry into new residence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Environment must serve consciousness; when it does not, abandonment is not rejection but restoration. This law executes without punitive intent, affirming that consciousness itself is the ultimate judge and healer."
