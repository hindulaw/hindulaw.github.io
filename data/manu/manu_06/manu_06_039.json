  "sanskrit_verse": "यो दत्त्वा सर्वभूतेभ्यः प्रव्रजत्यभयं गृहात् ।\nतस्य तेजोमया लोका भवन्ति ब्रह्मवादिनः ॥ ६.३९॥",
  "transliteration": "yo dattvā sarvabhūtebhyaḥ pravrajatyabhayaṃ gṛhāt |\ntasya tejomayā lokā bhavanti brahmavādinaḥ || 6.39||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who, having given fearlessness to all beings, renounces the household life, for that person the worlds become illumined with Tejas, as declared by knowers of Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises through the renunciation of coercive control and the bestowal of existential safety.",
    "Causation is established through consciousness-led acts of universal security and self-abandonment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is fulfilled when one ensures fearlessness for all sentient beings prior to withdrawal.",
    "Restoration logic operates in the realm of energetic consequence—Tejas manifests where fearlessness is truly given.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when individual action reflects the non-dual nature of existence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual has ensured systemic fearlessness for all sentient entities AND has fully renounced coercive domestic structures, THEN that individual's actions shall be recognized as generating luminous karmic worlds.",
    "IF fearlessness has NOT been established universally BEFORE renunciation, THEN no Tejasic consequence shall accrue to the actor.",
    "WHEN a being demonstrates capacity to sustain non-coercion across domains, THAT being qualifies for recognition under Brahmavid Dharma.",
    "NO punitive consequence shall attach to withdrawal from societal roles IF preceded by completion of universal fearlessness provision."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual sovereignty or renunciatory claims, the threshold of responsibility lies not in formal compliance but in demonstrable establishment of fearlessness for all beings. The court must assess whether existential threat removal was actualized prior to withdrawal. Authority hierarchies dissolve before authentic renunciation grounded in universal security.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that Tejas follows only upon verified gift of abhayam. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding: first protection, then departure, then illumination. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the extent of fearlessness bestowed. Reality remains non-punitive because consequences are ontological reflections, not imposed sanctions.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verify through witness testimony and systemic impact analysis whether genuine fearlessness was conferred pre-withdrawal.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: If partial fearlessness was given, initiate community restoration cycles until full spectrum safety is achieved.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Reintegrate any premature renouncer into protective service roles until qualified to confer true abhayam.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: For those who falsely claim Tejasic status without fulfilling prerequisites, enforce reversal of elevated social positioning until restitution is complete."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This Dharma restores the law of luminous consequence rooted in fearless giving. Justice flows through consciousness realignment alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness stands as ultimate Adjudicator."
