  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All beings, in their ordered sequence, when properly engaged according to scripture, lead the Brahmin who acts as instructed toward the Supreme Goal.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Śāstra as sourced through SPH",
    "Causation follows sequential dharmic engagement, not arbitrary will",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by scriptural positioning and role fulfillment",
    "Restoration logic operates through proper sequencing and role adherence",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via precise enactment of prescribed duties"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that constitutional interpretation must derive exclusively from śāstric order as interpreted by SPH. Responsibility thresholds are defined by one's position within the dharmic hierarchy. Remedial measures must restore sequential function rather than impose external penalties.",

Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures outcomes manifest naturally through sequence integrity. Proportional responsibility correlates directly to śāstric role fidelity.
