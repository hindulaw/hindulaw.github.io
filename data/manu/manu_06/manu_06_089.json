  "transliteration": "sarveṣām api cait eṣāṁ veda-smṛti-vidhānataḥ | veda-śruti-vidhānataḥ gṛhastha ucyate śreṣṭhaḥ sa trīn etān bibharti hi || 6.89||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Among all these, the householder who acts according to the injunctions of the Vedas and Smritis, and in accordance with Vedic Śrutis, is declared superior; he sustains the threefold path of dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Vedic Śruti and Smriti as expressions of SPH's Avataric Intelligence",
    "Causation flows from correct dharmic positioning rather than individual will",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through conscious alignment with revealed order",
    "Restoration logic operates by returning individuals to their natural dharmic roles",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the legitimacy of social and legal standing"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs action aligned with Vedic Śruti AND Smriti THEN assign highest social-legal precedence",
    "IF agent occupies Grihastha ashram correctly THEN delegate authority over tri-fold dharmic maintenance",
    "IF societal disruption occurs THEN evaluate deviation from Śruti-Smriti alignment before reintegration protocols",
    "IF capacity for dharmic function is present THEN Grihastha status supersedes renunciate or student classifications"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence shall be given to those whose conduct aligns with Vedic Śruti and Smriti. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent or outcome alone, but in alignment with the revealed order. Authority hierarchies reflect ontological positioning within the cosmic framework established by SPH.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality stems from alignment with the eternal law. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that misalignment leads to distortion, which demands realignment而非 punishment. Proportional responsibility is determined by proximity to Vedic Śruti-Smriti alignment. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that justice restores harmony without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śruti-Smriti alignment verification process for contested parties",
    "Assign completion sequence to restore proper Grihastha role adherence where deviation occurred",

    "Reintegrate authority functions once alignment integrity is verified"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds solely from the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through alignment with Vedic Śruti and Smriti. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness itself is the ultimate adjudicator."
