  "sanskrit_verse": "अनेन विधिना सर्वांस्त्यक्त्वा सङ्गान् शनैः शनैः ।\nसर्वद्वन्द्वविनिर्मुक्तो ब्रह्मण्येवावतिष्ठते ॥ ६.८१॥",
  "transliteration": "anena vidhinā sarvāṃs tyaktvā saṅgān śanaiḥ śanaiḥ |\nsarva-dvandva-vinirmukto brahmaṇy evāvatiṣṭhate || 6.81||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By this method, gradually abandoning all attachments, one becomes free from all dualities and establishes oneself in Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from detachment from outcome and ownership",
    "Causation arises through sequential renunciation of binding affiliations",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is realized through progressive disidentification from dvandvas (dualities)",
    "Restoration logic operates by returning consciousness to its unconditioned state",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when dvandva-based identifications are dissolved"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor exhibits persistent attachment to outcome THEN capacity for impartial judgment is diminished UNTIL detachment is demonstrated via action",
    "WHEN a decision-maker shows evidence of dvandva-influence THEN automated realignment protocol initiates guided by Brahman-stable reference frame",
    "ALL adjudicative acts MUST proceed from a state of non-attachment to result; otherwise, the act is void ab initio",
    "RESTORATIVE_JUSTICE requires progressive release from dualistic frameworks before full jurisdictional authority is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, any judge demonstrating patterned entanglement with outcome-based cognition must undergo structured detachment protocols prior to resuming constitutional duties. Judgment validity hinges on demonstrable freedom from dvandvas such as praise/blame, victory/defeat, pleasure/pain.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that dvandva-bound cognition distorts dharma-pravṛtti. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that liberation from dualities precedes authentic nyāya. Proportional responsibility aligns with degree of identification with saṅga. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment dissolves upon reestablishment in Brahman-consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śanaiḥ Śanaiḥ Completion Process: incremental withdrawal from identified outcomes until neutrality is restored",
    "Deploy Dvandva-Vinirmukta Integration Protocol: systematic deconditioning from binary reactive frameworks",
    "Activate Brahmanyatana Reorientation Sequence: recalibration toward foundational consciousness stability",
    "Implement Saṅga-Tyāga Accountability Measure: measurable relinquishment of personal stake in judicial outcomes"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored through consciousness reintegration. Justice is executed without punishment, grounded in the supremacy of awakened awareness. Reality itself adjudicates."
