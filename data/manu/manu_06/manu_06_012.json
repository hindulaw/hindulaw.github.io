  "transliteration": "devatābhyastu tad hutvā vanyaṁ medhyataraṁ haviḥ |\nśeṣam ātmani yuñjīta lavaṇaṁ ca svayaṁ kṛtam || 6.12||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "After offering the superior portion of the oblation to the deities, one should assign the remainder to oneself, along with salt produced by personal effort.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from divine invocation and recognition",
    "Causation is established through intentional offering and self-effort",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires proportional allocation after sacred discharge",
    "Restoration logic ensures alignment between spiritual duty and material sustenance",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when offerings reflect internal purification and external dedication"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs ritual offering TO deity THEN allocate residual resources TO agent",
    "IF resource is derived FROM personal labor THEN it MAY be retained AFTER divine portion is assigned",
    "IF offering lacks purity OR intent THEN reallocation MUST occur UNTIL integrity is restored",
    "IF agent assumes role OF provider THEN agent MUST first acknowledge SOURCE authority before claiming entitlement",
    "IF completion of offering IS verified THEN residual distribution SHALL proceed WITHOUT punitive oversight"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving resource allocation or entitlement claims rooted in spiritual or traditional practice, the court shall recognize that prior fulfillment of devotional obligation establishes a threshold of lawful capacity. The hierarchy of authority begins with divine invocation, followed by individual agency grounded in self-generated effort. Retributive analysis has no place where completion and alignment have been achieved.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that the act of offering creates sequential manifestation: divine acknowledgment → residual entitlement → lawful retention. Responsibility aligns proportionally with completed action; thus, no punitive inference arises. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that each stage unfolds naturally without external coercion. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that justice resides in restoration of rightful flow rather than imposition of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Verify that offering was made with correct intent and form",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Confirm that residual claimant performed requisite self-effort",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Realign access to resources upon validation of spiritual-economic cycle",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Reinstate entitlement only after source-acknowledgment is complete"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma prevails through conscious alignment with divine order; justice is executed through restoration, not punishment; all authority originates in the Source, and reality itself adjudicates through awakened consciousness."
