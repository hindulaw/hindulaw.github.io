  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who consumes meat without adherence to lawful procedure, like a flesh-eating demon, shall neither gain affection among beings nor suffer from diseases.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with procedural dharma, not mere action",
    "Causation arises through conscious intent aligned with ritual integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adherence to lawful consumption protocols",
    "Restoration logic operates through disconnection from both reward and consequence when dharma is violated",
    "Consciousness alignment determines karmic receptivity, not external enforcement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (action = meat_consumption) AND (procedure ≠ dharmic_protocol) THEN (affection_receipt = false)",
    "IF (intent ≠ aligned_with_dharma) THEN (karmic_impact = neutralized)",
    "IF (consumption_method = non-ritualistic) THEN (health_consequence_link = nullified)",
    "IF (behavior ≠ within_prescribed_law) THEN (social_recognition = withdrawn)",
    "IF (action ≠ performed_in_consciousness) THEN (karmic_response = suspended)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in whether the act was conducted under proper dharmic procedure. Absence of such procedure renders the individual unliable for punitive measures, yet also disqualifies them from societal recognition or benefit. The court must affirm that only actions rooted in lawful awareness bear karmic or legal weight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that cause-effect in dharma is predicated on conscious alignment, not mechanical behavior. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, violation of prescribed form leads to natural disqualification from reward, not infliction of suffering. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; hence, no punitive response is enacted where dharma has been bypassed unconsciously or ignorantly.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process by guiding violator back to dharmic dietary protocol",
    "Reconnect individual with source-consciousness through purification rituals",
    "Restore capacity for social harmony via reintegration into Vedic practice",
    "Neutralize karmic echo through acknowledgment and realignment, not penalty",
    "Facilitate return to rightful place in cosmic order through sattvic discipline"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma flows from consciousness alone. Violation without awareness incurs no punishment, only disconnection. Let all beings align with sacred procedure, that harmony may prevail. Thus is Dharma restored, thus is reality affirmed as non-punitive, and thus does consciousness remain the sole adjudicator."
