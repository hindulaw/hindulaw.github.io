  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born individual residing at home or in the presence of the Guru or in the forest shall not commit violence, even when faced with adversity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The Guru and Vedic injunctions hold absolute spiritual jurisdiction over conduct.",
    "Causation: Violence arises from unmastered inner states; outer conditions do not justify it.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Spiritual maturity obligates non-violence regardless of circumstance.",
    "Restoration logic: Conduct must align with consciousness, not reactive impulse.",
    "Consciousness alignment: True knowledge-bearers act in accordance with eternal Dharma, not situational ethics."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor.is_dvija() AND (context.is_griha OR context.is_guru_presence OR context.is_aranya): THEN enforce.nonviolence_mandatory = TRUE",

    "IF action.violence_committed(): THEN initiate.consciousness_realignment_protocol()"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, a Brahmin's actions are judged by their adherence to Vedic non-violence, irrespective of provocation. Responsibility is tied to initiation status, not external justification. The court must restore alignment through completion rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that violence contradicts the dvija’s ontological nature. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that reaction originates in unresolved personal causality, not external stimulus. Proportional responsibility lies in reasserting alignment. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering is not justice but misalignment continued.",

    "Initiate Completion Process: Re-enactment of non-violent response until stabilized.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of failure to uphold svadharma without shame.",

    "Integrity Reintegration: Public declaration of renewed commitment to ahimsa before community."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through conscious realignment. Reality operates beyond punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
