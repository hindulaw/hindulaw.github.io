  "sanskrit_verse": "न विप्रं स्वेषु तिष्ठत्सु मृतं शूद्रेण नाययेत् ।\nअस्वर्ग्या ह्याहुतिः सा स्यात्शूद्रसंस्पर्शदूषिता ॥ ५.१०४॥",
  "transliteration": "na vipraṃ sveṣu tiṣṭhatsu mṛtaṃ śūdreṇa nāyayet | aswargyā hyāhutiḥ sā syāt śūdrasaṃsparśadūṣitā || 5.104 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When Vipras remain alive in their rightful domain, the body of a deceased Vipra shall not be handled by a Shudra. Any offering rendered through contact with a Shudra becomes unfit for svarga.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by ontological capacity and spiritual alignment, not social position alone.",
    "Causation arises through purity of action and consciousness, not mere physical proximity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands alignment with one's dharma-svarupa, not external hierarchies.",
    "Restoration logic requires purification of energetic fields disrupted by misaligned contact.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that ritual acts retain their celestial efficacy."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Vipra is alive AND within their designated spiritual domain, THEN no Shudra shall perform rites or handle the corpse of said Vipra.",
    "IF any ritual act involves direct tactile contact between a Shudra and a deceased Vipra’s body, THEN that act is automatically disqualified from generating svargic merit.",
    "IF an offering has been contaminated by unauthorized touch, THEN it must undergo specific prana-shuddhi protocols before reintegration into sacred practice.",
    "IF violation occurs due to negligence, THEN responsible party must execute full dharmic completion process under guidance of qualified Acharya."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving ritual law and caste-related conduct, the Supreme Court must recognize the primacy of ontological fitness over social convention. The threshold of responsibility lies in maintaining energetic purity during sacred acts. Violations are addressed via restoration protocols led by recognized spiritual authorities, not punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that svargic fruit depends on pure intention and authorized execution. When contamination occurs, sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) shows how impurity disrupts causal flow. Responsibility is proportional to awareness; thus, correction follows re-alignment rather than suffering. Non-punitive reality holds because consciousness itself enforces karmic integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra Shuddhi Yajna to restore energetic field around violated site.",
    "Assign offender completion process including recitation of Purusha Sukta 108 times under supervision.",
    "Realign all involved parties through Panchagni Vidya diksha to recalibrate consciousness.",
    "Conduct Rudra Abhisheka to dissolve residual karmic impressions caused by improper handling."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. Justice is executed through consciousness restoration, not punishment. Dharma stands reaffirmed. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
