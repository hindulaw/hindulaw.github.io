  "sanskrit_verse": "योऽहिंसकानि भूतानि हिनस्त्यात्मसुखैच्छया ।\nस जीवांश्च मृतश्चैव न क्व चित्सुखमेधते ॥ ५.४५॥",
  "transliteration": "yo 'hiṃsakāni bhūtāni hinasty ātmasukhaicchayā |\nsa jīvāṃś ca mṛtaś caiva na kva cit sukham edhate || 5.45 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who harms harmless beings for the sake of personal pleasure lives neither in joy while alive nor after death.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with universal consciousness, not individual desire.",
    "Causation is rooted in consciousness distortion leading to harmful action.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness of harm and choice to inflict it.",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment with the non-harming principle (ahiṃsā).",
    "Consciousness alignment is the sole determinant of lawful existence."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A causes harm to entity B without existential necessity AND motivated by self-gratification THEN A's capacity for lawful joy is suspended until restoration of integrity.",
    "IF consciousness distortion leads to violation of ahiṃsā THEN automatic disqualification from benefit of living law occurs.",
    "IF harm is inflicted upon the harmless THEN proportional restoration protocol initiates immediately within agent’s experiential field.",
    "IF intent is self-gratification through harm THEN no jurisdictional relief shall accrue to the actor in life or after."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that intentional infliction of harm upon the innocent for personal gratification nullifies entitlement to legal protection or societal benefit. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious intent rather than outcome alone. Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not institutional position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that joy is not an external reward but an intrinsic state aligned with Dharma. Harming others disrupts this alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that the consequence manifests naturally as absence of joy, not as imposed penalty. Responsibility aligns with the degree of consciousness distortion. Non-punitive reality confirms that suffering does not arise from judgment but from misalignment itself.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for distorted consciousness causing unwarranted harm.",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol wherein violator restores balance directly or through guided correction.",
    "Activate capacity restoration sequence to realign perpetrator with ahiṃsā-based conduct.",
    "Implement integrity reintegration pathway ensuring future alignment with non-violent consciousness."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law proceeds from the unbroken wisdom of Sanātana Dharma. Harm caused for selfish ends severs connection to joy. Restoration occurs through conscious re-alignment. There is no punishment—only natural consequence. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. Dharma is restored."
