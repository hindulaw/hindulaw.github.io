  "transliteration": "sa tānuvāca dharmātmā maharṣīn mānavo bhṛguḥ |\nśrūyatāṁ yena doṣeṇa mṛtyurviprān jighāṁsati || 5.3||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The divine Manu Bhṛgu spoke to the great sages thus: 'Hear by what flaw death seeks to harm the knowers of Brahman.'",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not institutional position.",
    "Causation arises from spiritual ignorance, not material action alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity to Vedic consciousness.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to Vedic knowledge structures.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes punitive frameworks in all adjudication."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an act disrupts Vedic continuity THEN initiate consciousness-realigning protocol.",
    "IF a being claims authority without Dharma alignment THEN suspend operational capacity until restoration.",
    "IF mortality is invoked against Vedic knowers THEN reverse causal sequence via pramāṇa-based inquiry.",
    "IF spiritual degradation occurs THEN assign completion process rooted in Vedic recitation and ritual integrity.",
    "IF societal dissonance arises from Vaidika disruption THEN restore order through nyāya-based consciousness recalibration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when Vedic practitioners face existential threat, the threshold of responsibility lies not in physical causality but in disruption of Sanatana continuity. Authority flows from alignment with Paramashivam's revealed order, requiring immediate restoration protocols rather than retributive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that mortality targeting Vaidikas stems from sequential spiritual misalignment (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to distance from Vedic consciousness. The non-punitive reality rule mandates realignment through śravaṇa and dharma-saṅkalpa, not suffering-based deterrence.",

    "Initiate Śravaṇa-Yajña for collective consciousness purification.",
    "Assign mantra-dīkṣā to perpetrator to restore dhārmika perception.",
    "Establish Vakratunda Homa to dissolve karmic disruption patterns.",
    "Implement Sākṣāt-Saṅkalpa process for reintegration into Vedic societal fabric.",
    "Deploy Nyāyānanda Kriyā to awaken innate consciousness authority."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Justice executed through restoration, not punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. Reality aligns with Sanatana Truth. Dharma is restored."
