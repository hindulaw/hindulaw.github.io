  "sanskrit_verse": "बभूवुर्हि पुरोडाशा भक्ष्याणां मृगपक्षिणाम् ।\nपुराणेष्वपि यज्ञेषु ब्रह्मक्षत्रसवेषु च ॥ ५.२३॥ पुराणेष्वृषियज्ञेषु",
  "transliteration": "babhūvuḥ hi purōḍāśā bhakṣyāṇāṁ mṛga-pakṣiṇām | purāṇeṣv api yajñeṣu brahma-kṣatra-saveṣu ca || 5.23 || purāṇeṣv ṛṣi-yajñeṣu",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In ancient times, offerings of flesh from deer and birds were made lawful within Vedic sacrifices performed by sages, Brahmins, and Kshatriyas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as derived from alignment with Sanatana Dharma",
    "Causation rooted in ritual integrity and divine injunction",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by varna-dharma and spiritual station",
    "Restoration through reconnection to dharmic action",
    "Consciousness alignment via participation in Vedic sacrificial order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor performs Vedic sacrifice AND offering includes animal flesh AND actor is of varna qualified for such ritual THEN act is lawful under dharma",
    "IF consumption of meat occurs within framework of authorized yajna THEN no violation of non-violence principle",
    "IF individual lacks qualification for Vedic sacrifice THEN consumption of meat outside yajna constitutes misaligned action requiring realignment protocol",
    "IF act aligns with pravritti-dharma under supervision of qualified guru THEN no corrective enforcement required"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court shall recognize that authority to determine permissibility of meat consumption lies exclusively within the framework of Vedic ritual law as interpreted by those established in parampara. Acts outside this framework must be evaluated solely for capacity misalignment and corrected through consciousness restoration, not punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consumption within yajna is causally distinct from ordinary killing due to intention, method, and consecration. Sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) shows that such acts proceed from scriptural command, not personal desire. Responsibility is proportional to one's station and knowledge; thus, correction flows toward reintegration into dharmic capacity rather than punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Individual must perform prescribed yajna under qualified guru to restore ritual alignment",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledgment of misaligned action followed by commitment to dharmic conduct",
    "Capacity Restoration: Education in varna-dharma and proper consumption ethics according to svadharma",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public reaffirmation of commitment to Vedic principles before community elders"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. This Dharma has been executed. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
