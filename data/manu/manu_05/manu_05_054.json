  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who consumes pure fruits, roots, and almsfood offered by sages and renunciants without abstaining from meat does not attain the merit of such consumption.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Merit accrues only when aligned with complete dharmic conduct.",
    "Causation: Consumption rooted in partial restraint lacks full karmic consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Full capacity for dharma must be activated for action to bear fruit.",
    "Restoration logic: Misaligned actions require reorientation to original dharmic intent.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Ritual purity is ineffective without internal purification."

    "IF (action.is_dharmically_aligned == true AND restraint.is_partial == false) THEN merit.is_valid = true ELSE merit.is_valid = false",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that incomplete adherence disrupts causal alignment; therefore, no punitive measure is required—only correction of understanding and completion of dharma. The sequence of cause-effect remains intact through conscious realignment rather than coercive penalty.",

    "Completion Process: Reintroduce full dietary discipline including meat-abstinence.",
