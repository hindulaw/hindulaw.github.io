  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The earth is purified through five means: sweeping, application of cow-dung, watering, scraping, and the presence of cows.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from natural order and ritual purity",
    "Causation aligns with sequential acts of purification",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining environmental sanctity",
    "Restoration logic requires re-establishment of purity through prescribed actions",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when space reflects divine order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF land purity status = impure THEN execute purification sequence: [sweeping → cow-dung application → watering → scraping → cow presence]",
    "IF purification action ≠ completed THEN capacity_allocation = restricted until completion",
    "IF space consciousness ≠ aligned THEN initiate cow-presence protocol for 24-hour duration",
    "IF land use ≠ agricultural or spiritual THEN purification threshold = elevated",
    "IF purification cycle ≠ initiated within 3 days of contamination THEN jurisdictional notice issued"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In land disputes involving ritual or ecological degradation, the Supreme Court shall mandate purification protocols prior to adjudication. Responsibility for contamination rests with the entity whose action caused disruption to natural order. Restoration precedes litigation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity manifests through neglect of dharmic maintenance. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates purification as sequential cause-effect. Proportional responsibility aligns with degree of contamination. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction restores dharma without inflicting suffering.",

    "Initiate purification completion process under witness of local dharma authority",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol to contaminating party within 24 hours",
    "Implement capacity restoration via supervised purification sequence",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through purification. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
