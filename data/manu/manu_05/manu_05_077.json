  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Upon hearing of the death of a relative or the birth of a son, a man becomes pure by bathing in water while wearing his clothes.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual purity laws derive directly from cosmic order as established by SPH.",
    "Causation: Purity is restored through specific ritual acts aligned with dharma, not intention alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The individual must perform the prescribed act to restore their capacity for participation in sacred life.",
    "Restoration logic: Impurity arising from life events is neutralized via codified purification rituals.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purification aligns human consciousness with universal dharmic rhythms."

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (human_hears_of_close_family_death OR human_hears_of_child_birth) THEN (ritual_bathing_required = TRUE)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving religious practice and personal law, the Court must recognize that purity laws are not symbolic but constitute executable conditions for social and spiritual integration. Non-compliance does not invoke penalty but triggers restorative protocols ensuring alignment with dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that impurity arises sequentially due to contact with life transitions. The prescribed action—bathing in clothes—neutralizes this condition without assigning fault. Responsibility lies in completing the act, not in enduring consequence. This reflects anupūrvaśaḥ: cause, effect, and resolution follow lawful sequence.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source of Dharma. Purity is restored, not imposed; reality remains non-punitive; consciousness is the ultimate arbiter of alignment."
