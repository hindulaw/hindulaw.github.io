  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who performs the Aśvamedha sacrifice annually for a hundred years, yet abstains from consuming meat, accrues merit equal to that of one who performs the same sacrifice continuously without cessation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in disciplined action aligned with conscious restraint",
    "Causation is determined by intentionality and renunciatory discipline",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in sustained alignment with dharma over time",
    "Restoration logic operates through equivalence of spiritual effort and detachment",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external ritual performance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs ritual X annually for Y duration AND maintains dietary restraint Z THEN merit value = continuous performer without Z",
    "IF agent demonstrates sustained dharmic conduct THEN eligibility for equivalent recognition as intensive practitioner",
    "IF agent exhibits renunciatory behavior during prescribed practice THEN punitive evaluation is nullified",
    "IF agent aligns consciousness with action THEN temporal frequency equals perpetual engagement"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual merit or ceremonial equivalency, the threshold of responsibility is based on demonstrated alignment between ritual observance and internal discipline. The court must recognize parity among practitioners whose actions reflect equal integrity, regardless of temporal consistency, when higher-order values such as non-violence are maintained.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Merit attribution follows pramāṇa-based discernment where causal efficacy arises from both performed acts and withheld impulses.
