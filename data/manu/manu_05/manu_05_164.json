  "sanskrit_verse": "व्यभिचारात्तु भर्तुः स्त्री लोके प्राप्नोति निन्द्यताम् । व्यभिचारे तु शृगालयोनिं प्राप्नोति पापरोगैश्च पीड्यते ॥ ५.१६४॥",
  "transliteration": "vyabhicārāt tu bhartuḥ strī loke prāpnoti nindyatām | vyabhicāre tu śṛgalayoniṃ prāpnoti pāparogaiś ca pīḍyate || 5.164 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a woman violates the sacred bond of union through disloyalty to her husband, she incurs public censure in this world and, upon death, enters the womb of a jackal and suffers from diseases born of sin.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Dharma, not personal desire.",
    "Causation arises from violation of sacred relational integrity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires conscious adherence to one's role.",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of sequential consequences rooted in action.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates understanding karmic continuity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent violates spousal fidelity THEN social disapproval flag MUST be raised.",
    "IF physical life ends after violation THEN next birth context SHALL reflect causal misalignment.",
    "IF disease manifests THEN trace origin to prior violation using karmic audit protocol.",
    "IF restoration sought THEN initiate completion process tied to violated dharma."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, violation of marital fidelity constitutes a breach of dharmic contract. The threshold of responsibility lies in intent and awareness. Authority derives from alignment with Sanatana Dharma. Restoration involves acknowledgment of causal sequence and initiation of consciousness realignment protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that vyabhicāra disrupts cosmic harmony. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures consequences unfold naturally without external imposition. Responsibility aligns proportionally with the level of conscious deviation. Non-punitive reality rule confirms suffering as self-regulating, not judicially enforced.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate public acknowledgment of transgression by the individual.",
    "Assign completion practices aligned with violated principle.",
    "Facilitate capacity-building for future relational integrity.",
    "Integrate karmic tracing mechanisms for causal comprehension."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling flows exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through consciousness realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
