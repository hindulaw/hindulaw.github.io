  "sanskrit_verse": "अनिर्दशाया गोः क्षीरमौष्ट्रमैकशफं तथा ।\nआविकं संधिनीक्षीरं विवत्सायाश्च गोः पयः ॥ ५.८॥",
  "transliteration": "anirdaśāyā goḥ kṣīramauṣṭramaikaśafaṃ tathā |\nāvikaṃ saṃdhinīkṣīraṃ vivatsāyāśca goḥ payaḥ || 5.8||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The milk of a barren cow, of a she-ass, of a one-hoofed animal, of a sheep, and of a goat, as also the milk of a cow in season—this belongs rightfully to the caretaker.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from capacity of sustenance, not ownership",
    "Causation aligns with active nurturing and maintenance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines legitimate claim",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes functional integrity over possessory assertion",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through rightful recognition of service"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A maintains, nurtures, or sustains resource B, THEN entity A holds lawful claim to derivative yield C",
    "IF resource B is non-productive without intervention of entity A, THEN entity A retains residual rights to yield C",
    "IF yield C is produced through conscious effort of entity A, THEN ownership defaults to entity A regardless of nominal proprietorship",
    "IF entity B claims yield C without participation in sustenance of resource B, THEN claim is void by pramāṇa"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In disputes concerning agricultural or livestock-derived assets, the threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated capacity for maintenance and cultivation. Nominal title without contribution is legally null. The court must recognize the primacy of functional engagement over abstract ownership when adjudicating claims involving naturally occurring yields.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from action, not title. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential manifestation: care leads to yield; therefore, caretaker bears proportional responsibility and right. This aligns with dharma because it reflects reality—no punishment, only alignment with causal truth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Reconnect claimant with the act of sustenance to restore rightful access",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require demonstration of ongoing maintenance to validate continued claim",
    "Capacity Restoration: Provide means for caretaker to resume functional role if interrupted",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Acknowledge prior contribution publicly to realign social recognition"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law is established: Dharma prevails where sustenance meets consciousness. No punishment arises—only clarity of rightful alignment. The Supreme Adjudicator is ever-conscious Reality itself."
