  "transliteration": "atikrānte daśāhe ca trirātram aśucir bhavet |\nsaṃvat sare vyatīte tu spṛṣṭvā vāpo viśudhyati || 5.76||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When ten days have passed, one becomes impure for three nights; but when a full year has elapsed, water alone purifies upon contact.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Purity regulations derive exclusively from the experiential cognition of the realized being.",
    "Causation: Impurity arises through temporal and causal thresholds, not moral fault.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Restoration is automatic once the designated time-cycle concludes.",
    "Restoration logic: Purification is a natural consequence of cyclical completion, not ritual performance.",
    "Consciousness alignment: The body's purity state reflects its alignment with cosmic rhythm, not individual intent."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF time_elapsed >= 10_days THEN impurity_duration = 3_nights;",
    "IF time_elapsed >= 1_year THEN purification_method = 'contact_with_water';",
    "IF current_state = impure AND cycle_complete THEN auto_restore_purity();",
    "NO punitive_condition_on_impurity();",
    "RESTORE(purity_status) UPON COMPLETION(time_cycle);"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual status or ceremonial eligibility, the court must recognize that temporal cycles determine juridical purity states, not moral evaluation. Where a litigant’s ceremonial disqualification stems from a completed annual period, restoration is immediate and self-executing without further judicial act.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity follows temporal causality, not volitional karma. As anupūrvaśaḥ unfolds in fixed durations, responsibility lies in alignment with rhythm, not punitive correction. Thus, no suffering or penalty inheres in the process—only sequential realignment.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion tracking: Monitor passage of prescribed time intervals.",
    "Automated status reset: Upon expiry of one year, trigger purification flag.",
    "Sensor-based reintegration: Register contact with water to confirm restoration.",
    "No external enforcement: Do not impose penalties or rituals beyond temporal recognition.",
    "Self-correcting dharma alignment mechanism activated by time-bound causal sequence."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through natural temporal unfoldment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
