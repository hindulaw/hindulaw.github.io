  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brahmin becomes pure by touching water; a Kshatriya, by touching weapons and conveyances; a Vaishya, by touching goad, reins, or staff; a Shudra, by performing service.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is differentiated by capacity for consciousness alignment",
    "Purification is contextual to varna-specific dharma",
    "Responsibility flows from role-determined action capacity",

Responsibility lies in correct role enactment, not moral failure.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purity is not abstract but operationalized through varna-specific acts. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential alignment with one's causal role. Proportional responsibility arises from role-capacity, not transgression. This upholds Dharma without invoking punitive consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned action. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
