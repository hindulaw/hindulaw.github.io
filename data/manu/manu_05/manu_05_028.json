  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All existence is food for Prana; Prajapati created all—both immovable and movable—as nourishment for the sustaining life-force.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from Prajapati as the Source of all creation",
    "Causation arises through the interdependence of Prana and material form",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining alignment with the life-sustaining order",
    "Restoration logic operates by returning entities to their natural energetic roles",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of unity within diversity"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity consumes or utilizes resource THEN entity assumes responsibility for its regeneration",
    "IF imbalance detected in ecosystem THEN restore flow according to original design intent",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all beings are part of a single energetic ecosystem governed by Prajapati's will. Legal thresholds must recognize mutual dependence and shared responsibility. Authority derives not from anthropocentric dominion but from alignment with universal life-supporting structures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality originates in Prajapati's creative act where all forms serve Prana. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfolding wherein disruption in one node affects entire circuit. Responsibility is proportional to one’s position in the energetic matrix. Retribution has no place because disorder itself signals misalignment—not guilt—and correction restores harmony without inflicting suffering.",
