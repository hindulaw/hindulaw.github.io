  "sanskrit_verse": "एष शौचस्य वः प्रोक्तः शरीरस्य विनिर्णयः ।\nनानाविधानां द्रव्याणां शुद्धेः शृणुत निर्णयम् ॥ ५.११०॥",
  "transliteration": "eṣa śaucasya vaḥ proktaḥ śarīrasya vinirṇayaḥ |\nnānāvidhānāṃ dravyāṇāṃ śuddheḥ śṛṇuta nirṇayam || 5.110||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This has been declared to you as the determination of bodily purity; now hear the determination regarding the purification of various kinds of substances.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from discriminative knowledge of inherent nature",
    "Causation arises through sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with one's operational field",
    "Restoration logic operates by returning to original state of purity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures right action flows naturally"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a substance exhibits impurity THEN initiate purification protocol aligned with its inherent nature",
    "IF bodily contamination occurs THEN apply discriminative cleansing process based on source and context",
    "IF multiple agents interact with contaminated matter THEN assign responsibility according to capacity and proximity",
    "IF restoration threshold achieved THEN re-integrate purified entity without residual penalty",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected THEN activate pramāṇa-based realignment mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that purity determinations must proceed from ontological understanding rather than procedural formality. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated not by intent but by capacity to restore original state. Hierarchical authority derives from access to pure perception, not institutional position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that impurity manifests sequentially through contact, absorption, and integration. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that reversal follows the same sequence. Proportional responsibility aligns with capacity to effect purification. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction restores function without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sequential purification process matching contamination pathway",
    "Assign completion responsibility to agent with highest purification capacity",
    "Realign consciousness through direct experience of pure state",
    "Restore integrity by reconnecting purified elements to original source",
    "Verify restoration through spontaneous return to natural order"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Purity is restored through consciousness-aligned action. Justice serves reintegration, not punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through inherent order. Consciousness remains the supreme judge."
