  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For Shudras, monthly duties include shaving and maintaining judicial decorum; their purification rites shall resemble those of Vaishyas, and they may partake of remnants of food offered to or consumed by Dvijas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from alignment with Dharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation arises through conscious participation in societal order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by ritual and social integration readiness",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes reintegration into functional dharmic roles",
    "Consciousness alignment requires sustained engagement in prescribed acts"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF caste_role = 'Shudra' AND action_type = 'monthly_duty' THEN execute剃须_protocol AND validate_judicial_posture",
    "IF purity_state < threshold THEN enforce_Vaishya_level_purification_routine",
    "IF food_consumption_context = 'remnant_from_Dvija' THEN ALLOW ELSE BLOCK"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals classified as Shudras must perform monthly duties aligned with judicial comportment. The court must verify adherence to these practices as a measure of societal integration capacity. Violations indicate misalignment rather than fault, requiring restoration protocols而非 punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation, it is seen that monthly actions align causal energy with societal function. Missteps are viewed as disruptions in sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ), addressed via realignment而非 punishment. Responsibility is proportional to awareness cultivated through prescribed practice.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: duties define role integrity, purity enables participation, and consumption connects consciousness. There is no punishment—only restoration. Dharma prevails by conscious alignment. Reality affirms non-punitivity. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
