  "transliteration": "prokṣaṇāt tṛṇa-kāṣṭhaṃ ca palālaṃ caiva śudhyati | mārjanopāñjanair veśma punaḥ pākena mṛṇ-mayam || 5.122 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By sprinkling, grass and wood become pure; by sweeping and anointing, a house becomes pure again; clay vessels regain purity through reheating.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Purity is restored through prescribed action, not abstract intent.",
    "Causation: Ritual purification acts as direct cause for dissolution of impurity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The nature of the object determines the mode of its restoration.",
    "Restoration logic: Impurity is not inherent; it is removable through appropriate process.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purity is not external condition but reflection of aligned consciousness."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity.impurity_type == 'contact-based' THEN execute_process(purification_by_sprinkling)",
    "IF entity.material_composition == 'organic_nonporous' AND contamination_level <= medium THEN execute_process(sweeping_anointing)",
    "IF entity.material_composition == 'clay_based' AND heat_resistance == true THEN execute_process(reheating_for_purification)",
    "IF entity.purification_status == 'complete' THEN update_consciousness_state(towards_alignment)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication concerning ritual or spiritual contamination disputes, the court must recognize that purity is not static but process-dependent. Legal capacity to restore purity lies in adherence to specific, ontologically grounded procedures rather than punitive measures against perceived defilement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes purification as causal sequence, not moral judgment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential restoration without attribution of guilt. Responsibility aligns with material capacity, not punitive attribution. Non-punitive reality rule confirms no suffering arises from contamination when addressed through correct process.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process via designated purification method based on substance type.",
    "Assign responsibility to custodian aligned with object's constitutional nature.",
    "Reintegrate purified entity into functional domain upon procedural validation.",
    "Verify consciousness resonance post-restoration to ensure systemic alignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through precise alignment with purificatory principles. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
