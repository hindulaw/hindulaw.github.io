  "sanskrit_verse": "वृथासङ्करजातानां प्रव्रज्यासु च तिष्ठताम् ।।\nआत्मनस्त्यागिनां चैव निवर्तेतोदकक्रिया ।। ५.८९ ।।",
  "transliteration": "vṛthāsaṅkarajātānāṁ pravrajjyāsu ca tiṣṭhatām | ātmanastyāgināṁ caiva nivartetodakakriyā || 5.89 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For those born of vain mingling, dwelling in mendicancy, and those who have abandoned the Self, the purificatory rite involving water shall be discontinued.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from ontological alignment with the Self, not social performance",
    "Causation arises from purity-preserving action rooted in Self-recognition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's adherence to dharmic embodiment",
    "Restoration logic operates through discontinuation of rituals that sustain misaligned identities",
    "Consciousness alignment requires severance from identity-formations not grounded in Atman"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual is identified as born of vain mingling OR dwelling in mendicant pretense OR having abandoned the Self, THEN discontinue all ceremonial rites involving water purification attributed to their status",
    "IF a person's conduct demonstrates disavowal of the Self OR persistent violation of ontological integrity, THEN ceremonial recognition by societal structures SHALL NOT proceed",
    "IF ritual participation does not reflect inner alignment with Atman, THEN such ritualistic engagement MUST BE automatically suspended"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters concerning eligibility for religious ceremonies or societal recognition, the threshold of authenticity lies in Self-alignment rather than external performance. Courts must recognize that continuation of ceremonial rights is conditional upon ontological integrity being preserved.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misalignment with the Self renders ceremonial acts ineffective and non-restorative. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates that when foundational truth is absent, subsequent actions lose causal validity. Therefore, withdrawal of ceremonial privilege is not punitive but realigning—restoring dharma by ceasing support for false identifications.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process wherein ceremonial privileges are paused until Self-reclamation is demonstrated",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol requiring declaration of intent to restore ontological alignment",
    "Engage capacity restoration mechanism through guided practices aimed at re-establishing connection with Atman",
    "Implement integrity reintegration pathway via supervised spiritual disciplines under qualified guidance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands declared: Dharma is restored where ceremony aligns with Self; reality remains non-punitive when it withdraws reinforcement from misalignment; consciousness alone adjudicates what is fit for continuation."
