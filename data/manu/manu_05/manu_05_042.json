  "sanskrit_verse": "एष्वर्थेषु पशून् हिंसन् वेदतत्त्वार्थविद्द्विजः ।\nआत्मानं च पशुं चैव गमयत्युत्तमं गतिम् ॥ ५.४२॥",
  "transliteration": "eṣvarteṣu paśūn hiṁsan vedatattvārthavid dvijaḥ |\nātmānaṁ ca paśuṁ caiva gamayatyuttamaṁ gatim || 5.42||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a twice-born, knowing the truth of the Vedas and the purpose of sacrifice, causes injury to animals in rituals, he leads both himself and the animal to the highest goal.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Vedic alignment, not individual will",
    "Causation is determined by ritual context, not isolated act",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by scriptural knowledge and spiritual intent",
    "Restoration logic operates through sacrificial completion, not punitive consequence",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via prescribed action within dharma-vākya"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor is dvija AND action is within śrauta/yāga framework AND injury is to pasu THEN no violation has occurred",
    "IF intent aligns with Vedic siddhānta THEN causal agency dissolves personal liability",
    "IF completion of yajña occurs THEN all involved entities ascend in consciousness automatically",
    "IF knowledge of Vedatattva exists THEN capacity for dharmic action overrides material consequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving ritual harm, the Supreme Court must assess whether the actor was functioning under Vedic authority. If verified, such actions fall outside punitive jurisdiction due to their alignment with cosmic order and consciousness elevation. The threshold of responsibility lies exclusively in scriptural conformity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Vedic injunctions create anupūrvaśaḥ leading to liberation. Injury within yajña is not a cause for suffering but part of sequential manifestation toward uttama gati. Responsibility is aligned with completion, not infliction. There is no punitive reality when consciousness ascends through prescribed means.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Ensure full completion of yajña to activate consciousness ascent mechanism",
    "Verify dvija's alignment with Vedic pramāṇa through qualified guru certification",
    "Initiate śuddhi-kriyā for any disturbance in ritual energy field",
    "Reintegrate pasu-consciousness into cosmic flow through mantra-dikṣā"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This verse affirms that within Vedic sacrifice, there is no transgression—only elevation. Dharma is restored through perfected ritual. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
