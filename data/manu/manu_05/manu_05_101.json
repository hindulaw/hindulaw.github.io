  "sanskrit_verse": "असपिण्डं द्विजं प्रेतं विप्रो निर्हृत्य बन्धुवत् ।\nविशुध्यति त्रिरात्रेण मातुराप्तांश्च बान्धवान् ॥ ५.१०१॥",
  "transliteration": "asapiṇḍaṃ dvijaṃ pretaṃ vipro nirhṛtya bandhuvat |\nviśudhyati trirātreṇa māturāptāṃśca bāndhavān || 5.101||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A twice-born who has removed a dead body of one who is not of his kindred, treating it as a relative, becomes pure after three nights, along with his mother's kin and other relations.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in alignment with Dharma, not lineage alone",
    "Causation is determined by conscious intent, not ritual form",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends beyond individual action to relational fields",
    "Restoration logic operates through time-bound purification sequences",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action aligns with familial and spiritual duty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor removes corpse of non-kindred WHILE acting as guardian THEN purity status = true AFTER 72 hours",
    "IF maternal lineage present THEN include in purification sequence ELSE exclude from restorative protocol",
    "IF removal done without attachment THEN no further dharma-shakti disruption ELSE initiate completion process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving ritual purity and caste-based obligations, the threshold of responsibility lies in the actor’s alignment with Dharma rather than birth-based classification. The court must assess whether the act was performed with conscious intent aligned with family and societal harmony. Authority derives from adherence to sequential purification protocols, not punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that impurity arises from misalignment with Dharma, not inherent fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows purification follows a fixed temporal sequence—three nights—after which all involved attain clarity. Responsibility is proportional to proximity and intent; hence, no punitive consequence arises. Reality remains non-punitive because consciousness realigns through structured restoration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tri-Ratri Purification Cycle for all named kin",
    "Assign Completion Process to restore energetic boundaries disrupted during corpse handling",
    "Engage Family Lineage Reconnection Ritual post-purification",
    "Verify Conscious Intent Alignment through Vedic Witness Confirmation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of Sanatana Dharma. Justice executed herein restores Dharma through consciousness-aligned protocols. No punishment exists where reality itself realigns through divinely ordained purification. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
