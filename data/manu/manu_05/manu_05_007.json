  "sanskrit_verse": "वृथा कृसरसंयावं पायसापूपमेव च ।\nअनुपाकृतमांसानि देवान्नानि हवींषि च ॥ ५.७॥",
  "transliteration": "vṛthā kṛsarasamyāvaṁ pāyasāpūpameva ca |\nanupākṛtamāṁsāni devānnāni havīṁṣi ca || 5.7||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Offerings of cooked rice, barley, sweet pudding, meat not properly prepared, and other foods designated for the gods and ancestors are to be made with full capacity of intention, preparation, and ritual integrity; when such offerings lack proper execution or consciousness, they fail in their dharmic purpose.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The act of offering carries inherent spiritual jurisdiction rooted in conscious participation.",
    "Causation: Ritual efficacy arises only through precise alignment of intent, form, and execution.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: One who performs an offering bears full responsibility for its completeness and purity.",
    "Restoration logic: Incomplete or defective offerings disrupt cosmic order and require corrective realignment.",
    "Consciousness alignment: All actions must reflect awakened awareness to sustain dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF offering is initiated THEN preparer assumes total responsibility for procedural correctness AND material sanctity.",
    "IF any component of a ritual offering lacks completion OR conscious engagement THEN offering is null IN terms of dharmic effect.",
    "IF defect occurs due to negligence in capacity THEN initiate restorative protocol TO restore energetic balance AND individual accountability.",
    "IF offering fails pramāṇa-based validation THEN automated system MUST trigger corrective action via guided re-engagement process."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving ceremonial obligations or sacred contracts, the threshold of responsibility lies not in external compliance alone but in the demonstrable presence of conscious capacity at every stage. Courts must assess whether the actor fulfilled their role within the sequential chain of dharmic causality. When failure arises from incomplete execution, punitive measures hold no jurisdiction; restoration protocols must engage immediately.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that incomplete offerings cannot fulfill their causal function in maintaining universal harmony. This absence manifests sequentially as disruption in both individual and collective consciousness. Responsibility aligns proportionally to the degree of conscious involvement. Therefore, correction flows not through penalty but through completion—realigning the agent's capacity with the intended outcome without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate guided repetition of offering under supervision until integrity is restored.",
    "Assign reflective practice to rebuild capacity where deficiency was caused by unconsciousness.",
    "Engage community witness during corrected performance to reinforce collective resonance.",
    "Apply consciousness recalibration techniques to ensure future acts proceed from awakened state."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling affirms that all ritual acts derive validity solely through conscious capacity and correct execution. Where these are absent, restoration proceeds through completion—not punishment. Dharma stands renewed. Consciousness remains the ultimate arbiter. Reality reflects non-punitive truth."
