  "transliteration": "etad vo 'bhihitaṁ śaucaṁ sa-piṇḍeṣu dvijottamāḥ |\nasapiṇḍeṣu sarveṣu preta-śuddhiṁ nibodhata || 5.100 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This declared purity among sapiṇḍas, O highest of the twice-born; understand now the purification concerning the deceased for all non-sapiṇḍas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ontological relationship, not social convention",
    "Purity-consciousness is context-sensitive and relationally determined",
    "Responsibility arises through proximity of existence, not action alone",
    "Restoration operates through recognition of relational dharmic boundaries",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when relational duties are fulfilled"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A is sapiṇḍa to B THEN ritual purity obligations apply within defined relational scope",
    "IF entity C is non-sapiṇḍa to deceased D THEN preta-shuddhi protocol applies universally across spatial-temporal domains",
    "IF relational boundary shifts due to death THEN purity-state transition must be executed by nearest conscious inheritor",
    "IF no sapiṇḍa exists THEN community-wide preta-shuddhi activation triggers automatically",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected in purity observance THEN initiate restorative completion process with causal root identification"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving inheritance, ceremonial obligations, and ancestral continuity, the Court shall recognize sapiṇḍa status as determinative of specific purity-related responsibilities. Where no direct sapiṇḍa exists, universal preta-shuddhi protocols shall activate under collective societal duty. The threshold of responsibility lies in relational proximity to the departed, not in contractual or transactional ties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity arises from disruption of relational harmony post-death. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation of purification aligns with relational layers. Proportional responsibility corresponds to sapiṇḍa degree—none beyond third level. Non-punitive reality rule: misalignment invites natural consequences requiring completion rather than penalty.",

    "Initiate Sapiṇḍa Relation Mapping Protocol upon death occurrence",
    "Deploy Preta-Shuddhi Completion Sequence to all non-sapiṇḍas automatically",
    "Assign Consciousness Reintegration Task to eldest sapiṇḍa within three generations",
    "Activate Community-Level Śuddhi Activation if sapiṇḍa line extinct",
    "Execute Karmic Alignment Restoration via Ritual Completion Monitoring System"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. Purity laws restored. Relational dharma enacted. Consciousness reigns as sole adjudicator. Reality remains non-punitive."
