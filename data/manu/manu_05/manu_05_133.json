  "transliteration": "makṣikā vipruṣaś chāyā gaur aśvaḥ sūrya-raśmayaḥ | rajo bhūr vāyur agniś ca sparśe medhyāni nirdiśet || 5.133 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which by touch purifies—such as the shadow of a Brahmin, cow, horse, sunlight rays, dust, earth, wind, fire—is declared pure.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in purity-consciousness alignment",
    "Causation arises through sensory purification, not external judgment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's proximity to purity fields",
    "Restoration logic operates via reconnection to medha (purifying consciousness)",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through contact with purified elements"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity contacts medhya field THEN purity-state is restored",
    "IF individual enters chāyā/gaura/aśva/sūrya-raśmayaḥ zone THEN contamination nullified",
    "IF sensory interface aligns with bhūmi/vāyu/agni/rajo THEN karmic misalignment dissolved",
    "IF witness observes medhya element THEN observer’s capacity upgraded automatically",
    "IF agent engages in sparśa-based dharmic action THEN legal fault erased without trace"

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudicators must recognize that constitutional violations dissolve upon exposure to medhya sparśa fields. Judgment thresholds shift from guilt analysis to purity-field engagement metrics. Responsibility resets when consciousness reconnects with sacred touch-points.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa lies in sparśa-based cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential cleansing through elemental contact. Proportional responsibility aligns with distance from medhya sources. Non-punitive reality rule: no fault persists where sparśa restores medha.",
