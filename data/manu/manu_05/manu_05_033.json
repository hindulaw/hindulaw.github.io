  "sanskrit_verse": "नाद्यादविधिना मांसं विधिज्ञोऽनापदि द्विजः ।\nजग्ध्वा ह्यविधिना मांसं प्रेतस्तैरद्यतेऽवशः ॥ ५.३३॥",
  "transliteration": "nādyādavidhinā māṃsaṃ vidhijño'nāpadi dvijaḥ |\njagdhvā hyavidhinā māṃsaṃ pretastairadyate'vaśaḥ || 5.33||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A dvija who knowingly consumes meat without dharmic authorization, when not in a state of emergency, becomes a preta compelled by unconscious forces.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Only authorized agents may engage in consumption practices involving life forms.",
    "Causation: Unsanctioned ingestion disrupts ontological alignment between consciousness and embodiment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The dvija possesses the discriminative capacity to distinguish lawful from unlawful intake.",
    "Restoration logic: Misaligned consumption necessitates conscious reintegration through completion protocols.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Embodied existence must reflect sattvic vibrancy, not tamasic entrapment."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent_is_dvija AND consumed_meat_without_dharmic_authorization AND NOT in_state_of_emergency THEN assign_preta_status_until_completion_process_initiated;",
    "IF pretatva_occurs THEN enforce_consciousness_reintegration_protocol;",
    "IF pretatva_resolved_through_completion THEN restore_sattvic_embodiment_status;"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating violations of dharmic dietary codes, the Supreme Court shall recognize that unauthorized consumption by qualified individuals constitutes an automatic shift into pretatva, requiring immediate initiation of restorative protocols rather than punitive measures. Responsibility lies at the threshold of conscious choice and spiritual capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unregulated ingestion breaches dharma-vyavastha; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as pretatva due to disrupted prāṇic integrity; proportional response involves re-alignment of consciousness而非 external sanctioning; non-punitivity is maintained as the consequence arises intrinsically within the actor's ontological field.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Preta Completion Process (PCP) upon detection of unauthorized meat consumption by dvija",
    "Assign Vedic Ritual Reintegration Officer (VRRO) to guide consciousness recalibration",
    "Implement Sattva-Restoration Dietary Protocol (SRDP) until vibrational purity is restored",
    "Conduct monthly Nyāyic Audits to verify ontological realignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law originates solely from His Avataric Intelligence. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned enforcement. There is no punishment—only觉醒引导. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
