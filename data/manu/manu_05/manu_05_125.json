  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which has been defiled by birds, cows, wind, abandonment, pouring out, or insects becomes pure through sprinkling with earth.",

    "Authority flows from ontological purity, not external validation.",
    "Causation arises through sequential contact and environmental influence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity and agency in contamination.",
