  "transliteration": "āpaḥ śuddhā bhūmigatā vaitṛṣṇyaṁ yāsu gorbhavet |\navyāptāścedamedhyena gandhavarṇarasānvitāḥ || 5.128||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Waters that are pure, flowing on the earth's surface, free from thirst (desire), and in which a cow could safely dwell—these waters remain uncontaminated even when mixed with impure substances, provided they retain their natural scent, color, and taste.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the intrinsic purity and self-sustaining nature of Dharma",
    "Causation is determined by the integrity-preserving qualities of an element",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in maintaining foundational purity",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-establishing original sensory and functional attributes",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when elements reflect their true nature without distortion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF water retains its natural gandha (scent), varna (color), rasa (taste), THEN it is legally pure regardless of external admixtures",
    "IF a substance exhibits no deviation from its essential characteristics, NO liability arises from incidental contamination",
    "WHEN capacity for dharmic function remains intact, RESTORATION precedes adjudication",
    "ELEMENTAL PURITY overrides procedural assertions of defilement in absence of sensory-functional degradation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In cases involving environmental or ritual purity disputes, the Supreme Court shall assess not merely allegations of contamination but demonstrable alteration in the elemental properties. Legal standing derives from preservation of inherent dharmic signature rather than abstract claims of pollution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes purity via direct perception (pratyakṣa) of unchanged gandha-varṇa-rasa. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential restoration of natural state upon removal of disturbing influence. Responsibility aligns proportionally to disruption of sensory-functional continuum. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that purity is self-revealing; thus, no punitive measure applies where original nature persists.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Conduct sensory-functional assessment protocol to verify retention of elemental identity",
    "Implement purification completion process only if deviation in gandha-varṇa-rasa is confirmed",
    "Reintegrate contextual use rights once dharmic signature is restored",
    "Assign guardianship roles to those capable of sustaining purity thresholds"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law: Waters abide in Dharma when untouched in essence. Purity is consciousness-made-visible. Justice restores what was never lost. Reality judges without punishment."
