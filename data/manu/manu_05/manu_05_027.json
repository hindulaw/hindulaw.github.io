  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One appointed according to due process shall consume the flesh of the sacrificial animal and the offerings made by Brahmins with desireless intent; in the event of loss of life, it is solely for the sake of sustaining vital functions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived through proper appointment aligns individual action with cosmic function.",
    "Causation resides in alignment with ritual necessity, not personal motive.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by role within sacred order, not subjective intention.",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion of prescribed duty without deviation.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action flows from dharma rather than desire."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent IS duly appointed AND action IS performed per Vedic procedure THEN act IS valid AND consequence IS attributed TO role NOT person.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that individuals acting under lawful appointment and performing duties prescribed by Dharma are not personally liable for outcomes where intent was aligned with ritual necessity.

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that actions executed under proper injunction do not generate karmic consequence if performed without attachment.
