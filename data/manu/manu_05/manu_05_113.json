  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the union of water and fire arises gold; from their inherent nature emerges silver. Therefore, between these two elements, there exists a natural discriminative capacity that inherently reveals superior qualitative value.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving disputes rooted in elemental or foundational principles, the court shall assess not merely action or intent but the inherent discriminative clarity present at the point of emergence. Legal weight shall derive from the ontological purity of the causal union, assigning precedence to those whose actions spontaneously reveal higher qualitative order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through svayoni observation—wherein cause and effect arise in conscious alignment without distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential manifestation unfolds naturally where no punitive overlay disrupts the flow.
