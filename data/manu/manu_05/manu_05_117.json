  "sanskrit_verse": "चरूणां स्रुक्स्रुवाणां च शुद्धिरुष्णेन वारिणा ।\nस्फ्यशूर्पशकटानां च मुसलौलूखलस्य च ॥ ५.११७॥",
  "transliteration": "carūṇāṃ sruksruvāṇāṃ ca śuddhiruṣṇena vāriṇā |\nsphy-aśūrpa-śakatānāṃ ca musala-ulūkhalasya ca || 5.117 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Purification of offerings and implements used in ritual sacrifice is accomplished through hot water; similarly, purification of winnowing baskets, plows, carts, mortars, and pestles must occur through appropriate cleansing agents suited to their material composition.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the ontological integrity of sacrificial action",
    "Causation arises through proper instrumental preparation and alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adherence to purity-preserving protocols",
    "Restoration logic demands congruent cleansing aligned with substance and use",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through ritually purified instruments"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an instrument is used in sacred practice THEN it MUST undergo purification commensurate with its material and function",
    "IF contamination occurs THEN restoration MUST follow via agent-specific methodology",
    "IF object serves ritual purpose THEN its cleanliness MUST reflect spiritual precision",
    "IF misuse or neglect detected THEN capacity-realigning protocols MUST activate automatically",
    "IF completion of purification process verified THEN operational sanctity IS restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ceremonial or spiritual practices, the Supreme Court must recognize that instrumental purity directly affects constitutional protections under Dharma. Legal thresholds for determining defilement or misuse require precise identification of both substance and usage context, ensuring no punitive inference overrides restorative compliance.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity is not a moral failing but a causal disruption requiring sequential correction. Anupūrvaśaḥ governs the stepwise return to functional sanctity. Responsibility aligns proportionally with custodial capacity. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment generates consequence only within the field of dharma, not personal condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate thermal-cleansing protocol using designated purifying agents",
    "Verify instrumental readiness through sensory and tactile inspection",
    "Reaffirm user's custodial commitment through conscious acknowledgment",
    "Document completion of purification sequence in dharmic registry",
    "Activate resonance-clearing mechanism to restore energetic neutrality"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of all Dharma. This ruling emanates solely from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice herein restores alignment without inflicting pain. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
