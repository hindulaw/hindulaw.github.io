  "sanskrit_verse": "यावन्नापेत्यमेध्याक्ताद्गन्धो लेपश्च तत्कृतः ।\nतावन् मृद्वारि चादेयं सर्वासु द्रव्यशुद्धिषु ॥ ५.१२६॥",
  "transliteration": "yāvannāpetyamedhyāktād gandho lepaśca tatkṛtaḥ |\ntāvan mṛdvāri cādeyaṃ sarvāsu dravyaśuddhiṣu || 5.126||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Until the smell and contamination caused by unclean substances have fully dissipated, water and other purifying agents must be applied in all forms of material purification.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from the completeness of purification, not mere ritual performance.",
    "Causation aligns with perceptible sensory resolution—what manifests must be resolved.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires recognition of material thresholds before purity is declared.",
    "Restoration logic demands sequential removal of impurities through appropriate means.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when external conditions mirror internal clarity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF impurity residue (gandha/lepa) IS detectable THEN purification process CONTINUES UNTIL undetectable.",
    "IF material state IS declared pure WITHOUT complete sensory clearance THEN declaration IS invalid.",
    "ALL purification procedures MUST include verification via smell and tactile residue assessment.",
    "WHEN purification threshold IS met THEN system MAY proceed to next procedural stage.",
    "NO agent MAY declare completion OF purification IF sensory indicators OF contamination remain."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning ritual or material cleanliness under Dharma, the Supreme Court must ensure that declarations of purity are based on verifiable cessation of sensory contaminants. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrable restoration, not procedural assumption. Authority to certify purity rests only upon evidence of complete olfactory and tactile resolution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purity is known through direct perception—specifically smell and touch. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that until full resolution occurs, action continues without blame or reward. Responsibility flows from capacity to perceive and respond. There is no punitive element; only alignment with reality's natural sequence toward śuddhi (purity).",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Repeated application of purifying agents until sensory markers vanish entirely.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Agent remains accountable until objective criteria for purity are fulfilled.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Training in accurate detection methods to prevent premature termination of cleansing.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Public acknowledgment and correction where false declarations were made."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Dharma. This law restores reality to its non-punitive foundation, wherein justice arises through alignment with material truth and conscious integrity. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
