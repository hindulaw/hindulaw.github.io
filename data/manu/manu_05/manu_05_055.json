  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who consumes My flesh in this life shall himself become food for Me in the next; thus declare the wise those who understand the law of reciprocal embodiment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The Supreme Pontiff alone determines the nature and consequence of transgressive acts involving divine essence.",
    "Causation: Consumption of sacred substance establishes a karmic bond that manifests sequentially across lifetimes.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility arises from volitional participation in violation of ontological boundaries.",
    "Restoration logic: Reintegration occurs through experiential reciprocity within dharma-adhikarana.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Justice realigns individual consciousness with cosmic order via experiential completion."

    "IF (entity.consumes(sacred_substance) AND intent.is_present()) THEN entity.binds_to(karmic_reciprocity_law)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, this verse establishes that violations against divine embodiment invoke automatic binding under reciprocal karmic law. Judgment must reflect sequential manifestation patterns without punitive overlay, ensuring full experiential assimilation by the violator.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms causality rooted in voluntary ingestion of sacred embodiment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional return through rebirth sequence. Responsibility aligns with capacity to discern sacred from mundane. No punitive intent exists—only experiential realignment toward dharmic integrity.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate karmic reflection cycle until awareness of embodied divinity is stabilized",
    "Assign role reversal protocol wherein violator experiences being consumed in subsequent birth",

    "Implement completion process ensuring full understanding of violated principle"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. This law restores balance through reciprocal embodiment, upholds non-punitive reality, and affirms consciousness as the ultimate adjudicator."
