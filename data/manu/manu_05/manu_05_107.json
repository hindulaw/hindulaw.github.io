  "sanskrit_verse": "क्षान्त्या शुध्यन्ति विद्वांसो दानेनाकार्यकारिणः । शुद्ध्यन्ति प्रच्छन्नपापा जप्येन तपसा वेदवित्तमाः ॥ ५.१०७॥",
  "transliteration": "kṣāntyā śudhyanti vidvāṃso dānenākāryakāriṇaḥ | śudhyanti pracchannapāpā japyena tapasā vedavittamāḥ || 5.107 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Through patience, the wise attain purification; through giving, those who cause inaction. The learned who conceal transgressions become purified through recitation and austerity.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in conscious capacity, not external form",
    "Causation flows from intent concealed or revealed",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with inner knowledge",
    "Restoration logic operates through self-corrective discipline",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs via internal rectification"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor demonstrates concealed fault AND engages in prescribed rectificatory practice THEN case resolved by consciousness realignment",
    "IF individual exhibits wisdom deficit THEN assign purification protocol through reflective patience",
    "IF agent causes systemic inaction THEN restoration enacted through mandatory giving within dharma",
    "IF transgression is hidden BUT remediation initiated THEN legal status reset upon completion of japa/tapas sequence",
    "IF accused shows Vedavit-level understanding THEN eligibility for advanced restorative Tapas-based resolution"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes that concealed wrongdoing does not require punitive exposure. Where a party voluntarily initiates rectification through prescribed spiritual discipline—such as japa, tapas, or daana—the court shall recognize completion of such process as sufficient legal restoration. Authority lies not in revelation of error but in verified transformation of consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that purity follows conscious effort, not punitive consequence. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential purification: concealment → recognition → rectification → integration. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for self-correction. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that suffering need not accompany justice when consciousness realigns with Dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Kshanti-based purification program for all cognizant actors",
    "Assign Daana-based restitution for causal disruption of action-flow",
    "Implement Japa-Tapas module for concealed transgressors until vibrational integrity restored",
    "Verify completion through biometric resonance alignment with Vedic harmonic baselines",
    "Reintegrate subject into social field upon documented consciousness stabilization"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through consciousness rectification, not punitive enactment. Justice flows from alignment, not affliction. Reality responds to vibrational correction. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
