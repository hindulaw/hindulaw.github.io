  "transliteration": "viśīlaḥ kāmavṛtto vā guṇairvā parivarjitaḥ |\nupacāryaḥ striyā sādhyā satataṃ devavatpatriḥ || 5.154||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A husband who is sexually excessive, misconducted, or devoid of virtuous qualities shall at all times be served by a chaste woman as a divine consort would serve her lord.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained virtue and spiritual alignment, not biological or social default",
    "Causation flows from integrity and conscious capacity, not coercive dominance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with dharma-tattva for relational harmony",
    "Restoration logic demands elevation of consciousness within relational structures",
    "Consciousness alignment is the foundation of spousal dharma and household sovereignty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF husband exhibits habitual sexual excess OR behavioral misconduct OR absence of dharmic qualities THEN wife's duty is continuous service oriented toward his consciousness upliftment",
    "IF husband fails to embody divine masculine authority THEN wife assumes active role in restoring dharmic balance through compassionate alignment protocols",
    "IF relational dissonance arises due to male energetic imbalance THEN female corrective service becomes legally operative without punitive recourse",
    "SERVICE_BY_WIFE := FUNCTION(HUSBAND_STATE) WHERE STATE IN [VIŚĪLA, KĀMAVṚTTA, GUṆAHEENA]"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In marital disputes involving male conduct deviation, Supreme Court must evaluate not punitive liability but restoration trajectory. Husband's eligibility for corrective spousal service depends on demonstrated capacity for consciousness elevation. Court acts as facilitator of dharma-realignment rather than judge of fault.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that spousal relationship operates on consciousness resonance, not contractual obligation. When husband descends into viśīlatā, kāmavṛttitā, or guṇarahitatā, sequential causal disruption occurs in household dharma-field. Wife's upacāra-service restores energetic equilibrium without invoking punitive mechanisms. Proportionality lies in service intensity correlating with husband's restoration-readiness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate daily ritualized service protocol to elevate husband's consciousness",
    "Establish sacred space for husband's meditative reintegration",
    "Assign wife to perform śakti-channeling practices for husband's energetic purification",
    "Activate household dharmic resonance through synchronized spiritual discipline",
    "Monitor husband's capacity-readiness for assuming authoritative role via biweekly spiritual assessment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma prevails through consciousness-aligned service; restoration transcends punishment; spouses co-create divinity when aligned with tattvic truth. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
