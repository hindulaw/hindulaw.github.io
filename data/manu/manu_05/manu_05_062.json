  "sanskrit_verse": "सर्वेषां शावमाशौचं मातापित्रोस्तु सूतकम् ।\n(जननेऽप्येवमेव स्यान् मातापित्रोस्तु सूतकम् ।)\nसूतकं मातुरेव स्यादुपस्पृश्य पिता शुचिः ॥ ५.६२॥",
  "transliteration": "sarveṣāṁ śavam āśaucaṁ mātāpitrostu sūtakam | (janane'pyevameva syān mātāpitrostu sūtakam |) sūtakaṁ mātureva syādupaspṛśya pitā śuciḥ || 5.62||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All beings undergo impurity upon death; however, for parents, it is specifically the birth-event that constitutes the ritual impurity. Upon touching the newborn, the mother alone bears the period of ritual impurity while the father becomes pure through contact.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual status derives from direct causal participation in creation.",
    "Causation: Impurity arises from ontological transition, not moral failing.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Responsibility aligns with biological and energetic proximity to the event.",
    "Restoration logic: Purity is restored through prescribed sequential action and acknowledgment of origin.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Spiritual cleanliness reflects recognition of generative source."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity is biologically generative parent AND physically contacts newborn THEN assign ritual observance phase to gestational carrier ONLY.",
    "IF entity is non-gestational parent AND makes physical contact with newborn THEN declare immediate spiritual purity via acknowledgment protocol.",
    "IF death occurs THEN all present entities enter temporary state of ritual non-conduct UNTIL completion of separation rites.",
    "IF entity performs purification act post-contact THEN reset spiritual conduct eligibility automatically."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication concerning familial rights or ceremonial duties, the court shall recognize the primacy of biological causality over social assumption. Only the mother, having undergone the transformative process of birth, enters a defined ritual phase. The father's role is acknowledged through purification-by-contact, establishing clear thresholds of spiritual engagement without moral implication.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes cause as biological involvement. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential spiritual states triggered by physical interaction. There is no punitive element—impurity is a natural ontological shift requiring procedural alignment. Responsibility flows from capacity, not fault.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Mother observes prescribed ritual cycle until declared spiritually complete.",
    "Assumption Protocol: Father acknowledges generative moment through touch, thereby affirming purity.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Both parties resume full dharmic function upon conclusion of respective observances.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Family unit resumes collective ceremonies once both parents have fulfilled individual roles."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of causal order. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as ultimate adjudicator."
