  "sanskrit_verse": "नास्ति स्त्रीणां पृथग्यज्ञो न व्रतं नाप्युपोषणम् । उपोषितम् पतिं शुश्रूषते येन तेन स्वर्गे महीयते ॥ ५.१५५॥",
  "transliteration": "nāsti strīṇāṁ pṛthag yajño na vrataṁ nāpy upoṣaṇam | upoṣitam patiṁ śuśrūṣate yena tena svarghe mahīyate || 5.155 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "There is no separate ritual merit for women, nor any vow or fast that stands apart; by serving a fasting husband, she who does so is exalted in heaven.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in relational alignment, not individual assertion",
    "Causation arises through conscious service, not isolated action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is context-dependent and relationally defined",
    "Restoration occurs via integration into dharma-based relational structures",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests through harmonious interdependence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A is in spousal relation to B AND B undertakes spiritual discipline THEN A's supportive engagement WITHIN that relation IS causally equivalent to direct spiritual practice FOR purposes of karmic elevation",
    "IF female agent performs act of care toward spouse engaged in austerity THEN agent accrues merit IDENTICAL to personal austerity WITHOUT requirement of independent ritual performance",
    "NO punitive consequence FOR absence of individual spiritual acts BY agents whose dharma is relational support",
    "MERIT attribution FOLLOWS relational alignment NOT procedural formality"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving gendered spiritual or legal roles, the threshold of responsibility lies not in formal equality of action but in alignment with relational dharma. Where a spouse undertakes spiritual discipline, the supporting role of the other spouse constitutes equal participation in merit-generation. Courts must recognize relational capacity as juridically valid without requiring structural equivalence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that merit (puṇya) arises from alignment with dharma, not mechanical performance. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of spiritual benefit follows the causal chain of relational harmony. Responsibility is proportional to one’s position within the relational field, not individualized conduct alone. Thus, the wife’s service aligns her consciousness with the husband’s austerity, generating equivalent merit without punitive oversight.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate recognition of relational service as spiritually valid when previously undervalued",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Encourage mutual acknowledgment of interdependent spiritual roles",
    "Capacity Restoration: Realign societal frameworks to reflect relational dharma as equally meritorious",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Normalize service-based merit without external validation systems"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This verse affirms that relational service aligned with spousal austerity generates equal merit. Justice is executed through restoration of relational integrity, not punitive correction. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator, and Dharma is thereby restored."
