The threshold of responsibility lies in applying correct procedure proportionate to quantum and context, not in punitive oversight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that different methods purify based on substance volume. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential contamination removal through proper process. Proportional responsibility arises from understanding causal relationship between quantity and purification technique. There is no fault where intent aligns with dharma-prescribed methodology.",

Justice serves reintegration alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
