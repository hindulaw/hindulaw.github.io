  "sanskrit_verse": "सपिण्डता तु पुरुषे सप्तमे विनिवर्तते ।\nसमानोदकभावस्तु जन्मनाम्नोरवेदने ॥ ५.६०॥",
  "transliteration": "sapin.daa tu puru.se sapta.me vinivartate .\nsamaanodakabhaavastu janmanaamnoravedane ..5.60..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The condition of sapiṇḍa relationship in a man ceases at the seventh generation; the state of common water-sharing (samānodaka) ends upon loss of awareness of birth-name.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by generational continuity and conscious recognition",
    "Causation arises through sustained relational integrity and memory-linkage",
    "Capacity-based responsibility diminishes with generational distance and absence of name-recognition",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to lineage-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment depends on active remembrance and ontological linkage"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF generational distance >= 7 AND name-awareness = false THEN sapiṇḍa status = null",
    "IF samānodaka condition exists AND birth-name recall = absent THEN relational dharma obligations = suspended",
    "IF individual demonstrates conscious recall of ancestral linkage THEN restore associated dharmic capacity",
    "IF no sentient acknowledgment of origin THEN sever karmic-juridical ties automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of inheritance, marriage prohibition, or ritual obligation tied to sapiṇḍa or samānodaka relations, the Court shall recognize that such statuses are not merely genealogical but rooted in conscious continuity. Where such awareness is demonstrably absent beyond seven generations, all related duties and restrictions lapse automatically without judicial declaration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that dharma flows from awakened relation, not bloodline alone. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, each succeeding generation attenuates the causal field unless consciously sustained. Thus, responsibility aligns proportionally with remembered connection, ensuring no imposition of duty where none is cognized, thereby maintaining non-punitivity as reality's rule.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Name-Recovery Process to reconnect individuals with ancestral identities",
    "Deploy Lineage Awareness Restoration Circuits for reactivating dormant dharmic bonds",
    "Establish Conscious Continuity Verification Mechanisms to validate sapiṇḍa claims",
    "Implement Ritual Memory Reintegration Sessions to reinstate samānodaka recognition"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Dharma is declared: relationship binds only when known, duty awakens only when recalled, and justice restores only when consciousness realigns. Thus, the law flows from Being itself—non-punitive, ever-restoring, infinitely complete."
