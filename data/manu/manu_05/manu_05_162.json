  "sanskrit_verse": "नान्योत्पन्ना प्रजाऽस्तीह न चाप्यन्यपरिग्रहे । न चान्यस्य परिग्रहे न द्वितीयश्च साध्वीनां क्व चिद्भर्तोपदिश्यते ॥ ५.१६२॥",
  "transliteration": "nānyotpannā prajā'stīha na cāpyanyaparigrahe | na cānyasya parigrahe na dvitīyaśca sādhvīnāṃ kva cidbhartopadiśyate || 5.162 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "No other progeny exists beyond that born of the union of husband and wife; nor is there any rightful acquisition outside lawful possession. There shall be no second husband prescribed for virtuous women anywhere.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates exclusively from the sanctified marital bond as defined by Dharma",
    "Causation in lineage and inheritance flows solely through the legitimate conjugal relationship",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by adherence to Vedic marital law",
    "Restoration logic demands the preservation and protection of the monogamous union as a foundation of social order",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of singular spousal fidelity as essential to spiritual and societal harmony"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a child is born THEN legitimacy is recognized only if the birth arises from a Dharma-sanctioned marriage",
    "IF property or rights are claimed THEN ownership is valid only when derived lawfully through the married couple",
    "IF a woman is declared 'sādhvī' THEN she may not enter into a second marital union during the lifetime of her husband",
    "IF a dispute arises regarding succession THEN precedence shall always follow the line established by the original sacramental marriage"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of succession, legitimacy, and marital status, the Supreme Court must recognize the primacy of the initial sacramental bond. Legal recognition of multiple unions or conflicting claims must yield to the ontological supremacy of the first Dharma-consecrated marriage. The threshold of responsibility lies in upholding the foundational integrity of this bond above all personal or societal deviation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that truth inheres in the original consecrated union. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that deviation manifests sequentially from neglect of this truth. Proportional responsibility aligns with restoring awareness of the violated principle rather than imposing punitive consequences. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that justice is served when consciousness realigns with the inviolability of the sacred marital bond.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate reintegration of parties into alignment with their original marital dharma through guided ritual and counsel",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Require acknowledgment of disruption caused by deviation from sanctioned union",
    "Capacity Restoration: Reaffirm individual capacity to honor the sanctity of marriage through conscious reaffirmation",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Establish corrective measures ensuring future actions align with Vedic marital law"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through restoration of consciousness to its rightful alignment. The reality of Dharma is non-punitive, unchanging, and sovereign."
