  "transliteration": "trīṇi devāḥ pavitrāṇi brāhmaṇānāmakalpayan |\nadṛṣṭamadbhirnirṇiktaṃ yacca vācā praśasyate || 5.127||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The three sacred purifications of the Brahmin were established by the Devatas: that which is unseen yet discerned through inner clarity, and that which is praised through speech.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from divine cognition, not human institution",
    "Causation is validated through both perceptual and supra-perceptual pramāṇas",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from access to supra-sensory discernment",
    "Restoration logic aligns action with inherent spiritual clarity",
    "Consciousness alignment is affirmed through ritual purity and truthful expression"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor has access to supra-sensory discernment THEN action is evaluated against unseen yet cognized dharma",
    "IF speech aligns with revealed truth THEN act is deemed praiseworthy under celestial validation",
    "IF purification process is disrupted THEN restoration protocol initiates via consciousness-realigning rituals",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the highest judicial authority must recognize divine cognition as a valid source of law. Legal decisions must integrate unseen truths known through purified consciousness alongside verbal testimony. Responsibility is determined based on one's access to and alignment with supra-perceptual discernment.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that divine insight constitutes a legitimate epistemic instrument.
