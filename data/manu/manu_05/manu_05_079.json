  "sanskrit_verse": "अन्तर्दशाहे स्यातां चेत्पुनर्मरणजन्मनी ।  चेत्स्यातां तावत्स्यादशुचिर्विप्रो यावत्तत्स्यादनिर्दशम् ॥ ५.७९॥",
  "transliteration": "antardaśāhe syātāṁ cetpunarmaraṇajanmanī | cetsyātāṁ tāvatsyādaśucirvipro yāvattatsyādaniirdaśam || 5.79 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "If one dies and is born again within ten days, then the Brahmin remains impure for as long as that being remains unliberated.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ontological continuity of consciousness, not biological life alone.",
    "Causation is traced through karmic identity threads, not merely physical death or birth.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility extends beyond mortal lifespan when karmic entanglement persists.",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of spiritual state over temporal markers.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of unresolved karmic patterns."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a soul reincarnates within ten days AND retains identifiable karmic thread THEN assign ritual impurity status UNTIL liberation event occurs.",
    "IF an individual's consciousness re-manifests in same jurisdictional domain WITHIN ten-day threshold THEN invoke continuity clause for dharmic obligations.",
    "WHEN purity status is queried FOR individuals with sub-decade rebirth cycles THEN defer judgment TO soul-resolution tracker system.",
    "UNTIL resolution of identified karmic loop DO maintain ceremonial exclusion protocols FOR concerned parties."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving rapid reincarnation cycles, the Supreme Court must recognize the continuity of dharma-bearing identity beyond single-life constructs. Authority resides in tracing conscious causality rather than chronological mortality. Restoration precedes reintegration where karmic entanglement persists across births.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal linkage between actions and their conscious manifestations, regardless of bodily transition. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding of consequences tied to unliberated awareness. Proportionality aligns with intensity of unresolved karmic residue. This framework enforces non-punitivity by locating resolution in completion, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Karmic Continuity Assessment upon verified intra-dashā rebirth reports.",
    "Assign Dharmic Guardian to facilitate completion process for unresolved karmic loops.",
    "Maintain Ceremonial Suspension until conscious integration milestone achieved.",
    "Execute Consciousness Realignment Protocol post-resolution to restore societal integrity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through recognition of supra-temporal karmic causality. Reality abides in non-punitivity. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
