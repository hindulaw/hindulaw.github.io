  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Women who adhere to heretical doctrines, wander unrestrained by desire, betray the trust of their protectors during pregnancy, or consume intoxicants—these beings have deviated from the natural alignment of consciousness and must be restored through completion and reintegration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious alignment with Sanatana Dharma as revealed by SPH",
    "Causation arises from deviation from svadharma and loss of integrity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and freedom of choice within dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification, realignment, and completion rather than exclusion",
    "Consciousness alignment is the ultimate measure of lawful conduct"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman adheres to pāṣaṇḍa THEN initiate purification protocol until svadharma resonance restored",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, such deviations must not invoke punitive measures but must trigger restorative protocols under the jurisdiction of dharmic oversight councils aligned with SPH's teachings. The threshold of responsibility lies in the degree of conscious misalignment; authority flows from recognition of dharma, not imposition of penalty.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that unregulated behavior stems from disrupted pramā; thus, anupūrvaśaḥ requires sequential restoration beginning with sensory regulation and culminating in consciousness realignment. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for discernment. There is no punitive reality because all actions are manifestations of ignorance seeking resolution.",

    "Initiate svadharma reorientation program led by awakened female guides",
    "Assign ritual purification sequences to restore energetic boundaries",
    "Enforce temporary guardianship under qualified dharmic mentors",
