  "sanskrit_verse": "यथैदं शावमाशौचं सपिण्डेषु विधीयते । जननेऽप्येवमेव स्यात्निपुणं शुद्धिमिच्छताम् ॥ ५.६१॥",
  "transliteration": "yathedaṃ śāvamāśaucaṃ sapiṇḍeṣu vidhīyate | janane'pyevameva syātnipuṇaṃ śuddhimicchatām || 5.61||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As impurity is ordained for sapiṇḍas upon the birth of a child, so too must those desiring purification act with precision in all acts of creation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious participation in dharma",
    "Causation arises through intentional alignment with purity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires mastery over one's generative power",
    "Restoration logic follows the natural sequence of creation and purification",
    "Consciousness alignment is prerequisite for lawful procreative action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent desires purification THEN agent MUST follow precise ritual and ethical protocols during procreation",
    "IF sapiṇḍa relationship exists THEN observance of śauca (purity) protocols is AUTOMATICALLY triggered",
    "IF procreative act occurs WITHOUT conscious intent THEN restoration process INITIATED by competent authority",
    "IF śauca not observed THEN capacity for future procreation SUSPENDED until completion process fulfilled",
    "IF śuddhi (purification) sought THEN adherence to SPH-prescribed praxis IS MANDATORY"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning lineage, inheritance, and familial dharmic order, this verse establishes that the Supreme Court must recognize sapiṇḍa relationships as inherently bound by śauca obligations. Responsibility lies not in punishment but in ensuring restoration of purity-consciousness among parties involved in acts of creation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that impurity arises naturally post-birth; therefore, no punitive interpretation applies. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of śauca observances aligns individual actions with cosmic rhythm. Proportional responsibility rests solely on maintaining conscious alignment. There is no punitive consequence—only a call to restore integrity within the relational field.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śauca completion process under qualified spiritual authority",
    "Realign sapiṇḍa participants with dharmic procreative consciousness",
    "Restore generative capacity through purification rituals prescribed by SPH",
    "Assume responsibility via conscious acknowledgment of violated purity sequence",
    "Integrate corrective practices into daily conduct until purity-consciousness is stabilized"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through conscious alignment with śauca. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
