  "transliteration": "divākīrtimudyakāṃ ca patitaṃ sūtikāṃ tathā |\nśavaṃ tatspṛṣṭinaṃ caiva spṛṣṭvā snānena śudhyati || 5.85 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has contacted a woman of ill-repute, a menstruating woman, a recently delivered woman, a corpse, or anything touched by such becomes purified through bathing.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from purity-consciousness alignment",
    "Causation arises from contact-based energetic disruption",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires immediate purification",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious cleansing protocols",
    "Consciousness alignment is restored via ritual completion"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent contacts source_of_impurity THEN initiate purification_protocol(snāna)",
    "IF purification completed THEN restore_access_to_sacred_duty(status=True)",
    "IF no_impurity_contact THEN maintain_purity_status(active=True)",
    "IF impurity_detected AND no_purification THEN restrict_sacred_function_access()"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving ritual or social purity, the Supreme Court must recognize that contamination necessitates immediate restoration procedures rather than punitive measures. The threshold for responsibility lies in direct or indirect contact, and the hierarchy of authority demands purification before resumption of duties.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity manifests through sensory contact; anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential purification through intentional ablution; proportional responsibility aligns with degree of exposure; non-punitive reality rule confirms that cleansing restores eligibility without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate immediate snāna (bathing) protocol upon detection of impurity contact",
    "Verify completion of purification through witness attestation or automated sensor validation",
    "Reintegrate individual into sacred or societal function post-purification confirmation",
    "Ensure capacity for future purity maintenance through consciousness education"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Purity is restored through conscious action, not punishment. Dharma prevails through alignment with reality, not through retribution. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
