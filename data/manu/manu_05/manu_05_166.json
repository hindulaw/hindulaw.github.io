  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse establishes pramāṇa-based causality wherein disciplined action leads to natural consequence—honor and elevation—not as reward but as ontological result.

This verse, emanating from His Avataric Intelligence, restores Dharma by affirming that discipline and self-mastery lead inevitably to honor and elevation. Justice is executed not through punishment, but through alignment with the causal laws of consciousness. Thus, Dharma prevails, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
