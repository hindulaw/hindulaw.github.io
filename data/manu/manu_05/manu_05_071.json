  "transliteration": "sabrahmacāriṇyekāhamatīte kṣapaṇaṃ smṛtam | janmanyekaudakānāṃ tu trirātrātśuddhiriṣyate || 5.71||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For those who have lived in celibacy under the same spiritual preceptor, purification is accomplished in one day and night after the transgression has passed. For those born of the same water (i.e., siblings or those closely related by birth), purification arises after three nights.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from shared spiritual discipline and familial unity.",
    "Causation flows from relational proximity and conscious alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on the degree of initiated awareness and blood bond.",
    "Restoration logic operates through time-bound purification aligned with relational depth.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment and dissolution of disturbance within relational dharmic fields."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor shares spiritual preceptor AND violation occurs THEN purification duration = 1 day-night AFTER cessation of act.",
    "IF actors are blood-related (same water lineage) THEN purification duration = 3 days-night cycles post-violation.",
    "Purification begins ONLY upon full cessation and conscious acknowledgment of misalignment.",
    "NO punitive measures apply; restoration occurs solely via prescribed temporal dharmic process.",
    "All parties involved must engage in integrative completion practices during purification period."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving individuals bound by spiritual initiation or familial ties, the court shall recognize inherent relational dharmic bonds that determine the nature and duration of purification. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious recognition and cessation. Authority resides in the capacity to restore harmony within these sacred relational structures without invoking punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that purity manifests sequentially based on relational intensity. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows purification timelines differ per relational field—shorter for guru-disciple unity, longer for biological kinship. Responsibility aligns proportionally with relational depth. No punitive inference arises; reality enforces restoration automatically when dharmic process is observed.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification countdown only after confirmed cessation of disruptive act.",
    "Assign completion rituals specific to relationship type: guru-shishya or janma-bandhu.",
    "Engage all affected parties in joint consciousness-realigning sādhanā for three days.",
    "Verify internal state of resolution before reintegration into community or practice group.",
    "Maintain registry of completed purification cycles for future dharmic clarity and automation."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through precise observance of relational purification timelines. Reality reflects non-punitive truth where consciousness alone adjudicates and integrates. Purification prevails; dharma is complete."
