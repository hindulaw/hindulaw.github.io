  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a disciple performs the ritual of Pitri-Medha for the deceased Guru, along with those who carry the corpse, that disciple becomes ritually pure after ten nights.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Ritual performance under guru-disciple lineage carries inherent spiritual jurisdiction.",
    "Causation: Purity arises through specific sequential acts, not intention alone.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The disciple's eligibility to perform sacred rites is determined by relational proximity and role.",
    "Restoration logic: Impurity is not a moral failing but a condition resolved via prescribed completion process.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Sacred acts realign individual consciousness with cosmic dharma."

    "IF actor == 'disciple' AND event == 'death_of_guru' THEN ritual_pitrimedha_required = TRUE;",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving religious lineages or ritual responsibilities, courts must recognize the authority of established guru-shishya paramparas in determining rightful performers of sacraments. Legal recognition flows from the ontological validity of Vedic succession, not institutional certification.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Purification is pramana-based — it occurs upon fulfillment of precise causal conditions (ritual + time). There is no punitive aspect; impurity is merely a transient state requiring procedural resolution. Responsibility follows relational capacity, not fault.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Execution of Pitri-Medha within ten days ensures natural restoration of purity.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Disciple assumes ceremonial role automatically upon guru's passing.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: After ten nights, all sacramental rights and duties are reinstated without further validation.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Participation with Pretaharas confirms communal witness and alignment with Dharma."
