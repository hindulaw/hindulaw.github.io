  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Knowledgeable purification of silk, conch, horn, bone, tooth, and iron substances must be performed using cow urine or water.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in purity-consciousness alignment",
    "Causation arises through intentional material sanctification",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires knowledge of substance-specific purification methods",
    "Restoration logic aligns materials with their original dharmic state",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures that purification acts as a bridge between material and spiritual order"

    "IF substance_type IN [silk, conch, horn, bone, tooth, iron] AND purification_method NOT IN [cow_urine, water] THEN initiate consciousness_realignment_protocol",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual or sacred material use, the Supreme Court must recognize purification protocols as acts of consciousness alignment rather than mere procedural compliance. Responsibility lies with those who possess knowledge of correct methodology. Ignorance does not absolve but necessitates capacity restoration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purification efficacy depends on both substance type and method. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential contamination removal when aligned with conscious intent. Responsibility flows from awareness, not punishment.
