  "sanskrit_verse": "पित्रा भर्त्रा सुतैर्वाऽपि नेच्छेद्विरहमात्मनः ।\nएषां हि विरहेण स्त्री गर्ह्ये कुर्यादुभे कुले ॥ ५.१४९॥",
  "transliteration": "pitrā bhartṛā sutair vā'pi necched viraham ātmanaḥ |\neṣāṁ hi virahena strī garhye kuryād ubhe kule || 5.149 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A woman must not desire separation from her father, husband, or sons; through such separation, she brings dishonor upon both lineages.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through relational dharmic alignment",
    "Causation arises from disruption of conscious interdependence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by role-bound integration",
    "Restoration logic requires reconnection to source lineage integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through harmonious familial participation"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a woman initiates or consents to severance from father, husband, or son WITHOUT valid dharmic cause, THEN automatic restoration protocol activates via family council",
    "IF societal disruption results from familial disconnection, THEN lineage elders are obligated to invoke realignment procedures",
    "IF individual desires conflict with relational dharma, THEN capacity assessment triggers consciousness-reintegration sequence",
    "IF both lineages affected, THEN dual-kinship reconciliation becomes mandatory enforcement pathway"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving familial abandonment or willful estrangement, the court shall prioritize restoration of relational dharma over punitive measures. The threshold for intervention lies in demonstrable disruption to either lineage's honor. Authority resides in the collective dharma-body of the kinship unit, not in individual preference.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consciousness manifests sequentially through relational roles—daughter, wife, mother. Disruption at any stage distorts the causal chain of dharma-sustained society. Responsibility aligns proportionally to the degree of relational withdrawal. Non-punitive reality holds because suffering emerges only when alignment with dharma is lost; thus, correction restores harmony rather than inflicts pain.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process between estranged parties using neutral dharmic mediator",
    "Reconnect individual consciousness to ancestral and future lineage continuity",
    "Assume responsibility through formal acknowledgment of relational debt",
    "Restore integrity via ceremonial reaffirmation of mutual duties and protections"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma stands restored through consciousness-aligned action. Reality remains non-punitive as long as awareness abides in relational truth. Consciousness itself is the ultimate judge."
