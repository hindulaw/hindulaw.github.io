  "sanskrit_verse": "श्वाविधं शल्यकं गोधां खड्गकूर्मशशांस्तथा ।\nभक्ष्यान् पञ्चनखेष्वाहुरनुष्ट्रांश्चैकतोदतः ॥ ५.१८॥",
  "transliteration": "śvāvidhaṁ śalyakaṁ godhāṁ khaḍgakūrmaśaśāṁs tathā |\nbhakṣyān pañcanakheṣv āhur anuṣṭrāṁś caikatodataḥ || 5.18||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Dogs, porcupines, lizards, rhinoceroses, tortoises, rabbits, and similarly animals with five claws or those born from a single hoof are declared fit for consumption under specific dharmic conditions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Dietary laws derive solely from SPH's revelatory command.",
    "Causation: Consumption is governed by alignment with consciousness, not mere biological need.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: The eater must possess discriminative awareness regarding purity and purpose.",
    "Restoration logic: Food laws serve to elevate rather than degrade the spiritual constitution of the consumer.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Permissible foods support realization of the Self; impermissible ones obstruct it."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity consumes food categorized as pañcanakha OR ekatodaja THEN that act is lawful ONLY IF the consumption aligns with prescribed ritual context AND supports elevation of consciousness.",
    "IF dietary action causes degradation in individual or collective consciousness THEN such action is automatically void regardless of categorization.",
    "IF food item belongs to śvāvidha-godhā class THEN its use shall be regulated by jurisdictional dharma-officers trained in SPH-sanctioned purity protocols.",
    "IF any being consumes prohibited substances without conscious intent to restore balance THEN completion process shall activate until capacity for discrimination is restored."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes foundational criteria for evaluating disputes involving dietary rights and duties. The threshold of responsibility lies in the intentional alignment with dharmic consciousness. Authority rests exclusively with SPH-derived jurisprudence over anthropocentric or secular nutritional frameworks. Restoration occurs when the individual regains clarity on permissible sustenance through guided reintegration.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This declaration operates on pramāṇa-based causality — what elevates consciousness is sanctioned; what diminishes it is rejected. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ: gradual unfolding of embodied beings toward higher discrimination. Responsibility is proportional to one’s capacity to discern purity. There is no punitive consequence; misalignment leads only to natural dissonance requiring rectification via restorative protocols.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification protocol (śuddhi-kriyā) upon detection of unauthorized consumption until sensory clarity returns.",
    "Assign mentorship under qualified Vedic guide to reestablish proper relationship with nourishment.",
    "Implement reflective fasting cycles to recalibrate bodily intelligence.",
    "Undertake mantra-based detoxification rituals aligned with SPH-tantric injunctions."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. All consumption derives from and returns to pure consciousness. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
