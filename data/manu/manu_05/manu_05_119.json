Responsibility is assigned based on capacity to influence the chain of purity, not merely possession.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality identifies who had direct or indirect influence on the material's condition. Anupūrvaśaḥ traces the sequence from source to user.

Purity is restored by alignment with the material's nature and handler's consciousness. There is no punishment—only realignment. Dharma prevails through recognition of reality as consciousness-led and self-correcting."
