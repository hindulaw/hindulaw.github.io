  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्किं चित्स्नेहसंयुक्तं भक्ष्यं भोज्यमगर्हितम् ।\nतत्पर्युषितमप्याद्यं हविःशेषं च यद्भवेत् ॥ ५.२४॥",
  "transliteration": "yatkiṃ citsnehasaṃyuktaṃ bhakṣyaṃ bhojyamagarhitam |\ntatparyuṣitamapyādyaṃ haviḥśeṣaṃ ca yadbhavet || 5.24||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Whatever food or drink, though uncondemned and offered with affection, becomes stale or remains after oblation—such remnants are to be accepted first, as they carry the essence of sacrifice and emotional offering.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the purity of intention behind offerings rather than material condition",
    "Causation flows from consciousness of devotion, not physical state of substance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in recognizing sacred residue as energetically potent",
    "Restoration logic demands reintegration of consecrated remnants into living practice",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through honoring offerings made with sincerity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an item was offered with sincere intent AND contains residual sacrificial energy THEN it MUST be prioritized for consumption or ritual reuse",
    "IF a substance is materially degraded BUT retains spiritual or emotional significance THEN degradation does NOT nullify its lawful status",
    "IF any entity rejects or neglects such remnants WITHOUT cause THEN that entity incurs a completion obligation until realignment is restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving religious or familial offerings, the Supreme Court must prioritize the ontological status of items given with sincere intent over their temporal decay. Legal thresholds of responsibility arise when neglecting such offerings causes disruption to collective dharmic integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the validity of an offering is determined by the consciousness at the time of giving, not its subsequent deterioration. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how intention manifests sequentially through acceptance and integration. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness of the offering's sanctity. The non-punitive reality rule confirms no suffering arises from neglect; only_completion_restores_order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where neglected remnants are ritually reintegrated into community use",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol to individual who disregarded the offering",
    "Undertake capacity restoration via guided reconnection with devotional practices",
    "Enforce integrity reintegration through public acknowledgment and ceremonial renewal"

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: this Dharma stands executed. The law flows from consciousness, not condition. Reality remains non-punitive. Dharma is restored. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
