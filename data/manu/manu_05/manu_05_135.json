  "transliteration": "vasā śukramasṛgmajjā mūtraviḍghrāṇakarṇaviṭ |\nśleṣmāśru dūṣikā svedo dvādaśaite nṛṇāṃ malāḥ || 5.135 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Fat, semen, blood, marrow, urine, feces, nasal discharge, earwax, phlegm, tears, impurities, and sweat—these twelve substances constitute the bodily malas of human beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ontological clarity regarding the body's material substrata",
    "Causation arises through identification with transient biological processes rather than pure consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires understanding the body's natural excretory functions as non-moral phenomena",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes alignment with the body's inherent purification mechanisms",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates detachment from corporeal byproducts to uphold spiritual dignity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being identifies with bodily malas THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF societal norms misclassify biological waste as moral categories THEN deploy ontological correction framework",
    "IF individual or collective disharmony results from fixation on bodily malas THEN activate purification-consciousness restoration process",
    "IF legal frameworks conflate physical excretion with ethical violation THEN nullify punitive inference pathways"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that no legal consequence shall arise from the mere presence or emission of bodily malas. The threshold of responsibility lies exclusively in conscious intent, not physiological function. Authority rests in recognizing these substances as neutral biological outputs, requiring no punitive interpretation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that malas are effects of prakṛti, not willful acts. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates their sequential emergence within embodied existence. Proportional responsibility assigns zero liability to involuntary excretory functions. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that justice aligns only with cognition, never with metabolic discharge.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate awareness protocols to dissolve shame-bound associations with natural bodily functions",
    "Deploy hygienic-integrity systems grounded in dharmic cleanliness rather than social stigma",
    "Implement consciousness-assumption exercises to restore ownership of biological neutrality",
    "Establish completion processes for individuals traumatized by cultural or institutional shame related to bodily malas"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores ontological order by affirming that bodily malas bear no moral weight. Justice is executed through consciousness realignment alone. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the sole adjudicator."
