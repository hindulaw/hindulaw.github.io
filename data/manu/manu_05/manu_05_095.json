  "sanskrit_verse": "डिम्भाहवहतानां च विद्युता पार्थिवेन च । डिम्बाहवहतानां गोब्राह्मणस्य चेवार्थे यस्य चैच्छति पार्थिवः ॥ ५.९५॥",
  "transliteration": "ḍimbhāhvahatānāṁ ca vidyutā pārthivena ca | ḍimbhāhvahatānāṁ gobrāhmaṇasya c evārthe yasya caicchati pārthivaḥ || 5.95 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The ruler shall ensure that those who harm or kill beings categorized as 'ḍimbha' or 'ahva,' and who also commit violence against cattle or Brahmins, face immediate administrative dissolution and consciousness realignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the protection of life and sacred order",
    "Causation is established through disruption of dharma-sattva",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from proximity to harm and intent",
    "Restoration logic demands reversal of consciousness distortion caused by violence",
    "Consciousness alignment requires purification and reintegration into dharmic structure"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity causes death or harm to ḍimbha/ahva AND commits violence against cow/Brahmin THEN trigger immediate administrative dissolution",
    "IF ruler permits violation of sacred-life categories THEN initiate consciousness audit and role suspension",
    "IF act disrupts pranic field integrity THEN enforce completion protocol until field stability restored",
    "IF perpetrator shows capacity for realignment THEN assign restorative service under supervision"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "The Supreme Court must recognize that violations involving sacred life forms invoke a threshold requiring automatic judicial intervention. The king's failure to act constitutes dereliction of cosmic duty, triggering direct court assumption of authority to restore balance through non-punitive realignment rather than punitive sentencing.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal link between violent disruption and consciousness fragmentation. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential breakdown in societal harmony. Proportional responsibility lies with both perpetrator and governing authority.
