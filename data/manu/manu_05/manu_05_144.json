  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has vomited, undergone purgation, or engaged in sexual intercourse must bathe, consume ghee, and perform achamana before partaking food or performing ritual ablutions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The body's purity is a prerequisite for spiritual and legal participation.",
    "Causation: Physical acts disrupt subtle energetic alignment; purification restores lawful capacity.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Only those in purified state may engage in dharmic action.",
    "Restoration logic: Ritual hygiene re-establishes eligibility for conscious engagement.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Purity protocols align individual awareness with cosmic order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.vomited OR agent.purgated OR agent.engaged_in_sexual_act THEN REQUIRE full_bathing_protocol END",
    "IF bathing_complete AND ghee_consumed AND achamana_performed THEN ALLOW food_consumption ELSE DENY",
    "IF ritual_ablution_requested AND physiological_state.is_impure THEN BLOCK until purification_sequence.completed = TRUE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving ritual competence or ceremonial testimony, the Court must verify that the actor was in a state of bodily purity at the time of the act. This ensures alignment with foundational ontological fitness required for legal validity under Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity obstructs pramā (valid cognition). Thus, purification is not punitive but causal—removing obstruction to dharma-adhikāra (eligibility). Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential dependence: without śuddhi (purity), no śakti (capacity); without śakti, no adhikāra; without adhikāra, no phala (fruit/righteous result).",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Initiate mandatory purification sequence upon detection of physiological disruption.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Individual acknowledges their state and initiates restoration autonomously.",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Provide access to bathing facilities, ghee, and achamana materials immediately.",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Confirm completion through witness attestation or biometric verification."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Sole Source of Jurisprudential Truth. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate Adjudicator."
