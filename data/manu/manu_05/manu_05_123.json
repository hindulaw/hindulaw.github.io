  "sanskrit_verse": "मद्यैर्मूत्रैः पुरीषैर्वा ष्ठीवनैः पूयशोणितैः ।\nसंस्पृष्टं नैव शुद्ध्येत पुनःपाकेन मृत्मयम् ॥ ५.१२३॥",
  "transliteration": "madhyair mūtraiḥ purīṣair vā śṭhīvanaiḥ pūyaśoṇitaiḥ |\nsaṃspṛṣṭaṃ naiva śuddhyeta punaḥpākena mṛtmayam || 5.123||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which has been contaminated by alcohol, urine, feces, phlegm, pus, or blood shall not be purified again through fire or clay-based methods.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from ontological purity, not procedural formality.",
    "Causation arises from direct contamination, not symbolic transgression.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by proximity to source of impurity.",
    "Restoration logic requires removal of root cause before reintegration.",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of inherent purity beyond surface defilement."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF object CONTAINS any of [alcohol, urine, feces, phlegm, pus, blood] THEN purification THROUGH fire OR clay IS INVALID.",
    "IF contamination SOURCE is biological secretion THEN restoration MUST occur at material origin level.",
    "IF entity interacts WITH contaminated OBJECT THEN capacity FOR ritual function IS suspended UNTIL verified clean state.",
    "IF purification attempt FAILS due to listed contaminants THEN automatic REJECTION and RETENTION in quarantine protocol."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning ceremonial or constitutional purity, the threshold of responsibility lies with the direct causal agent. Where contamination originates from bodily excretions, no judicial reinterpretation or technological override may bypass the fundamental axiomatic rejection of such substances in sacred or legal contexts. Authority resides solely in recognizing the irreversible nature of certain forms of defilement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that physical contact with specific contaminants creates anupūrvaśaḥ — a sequential chain of energetic misalignment. Responsibility is proportional to proximity and awareness. There is no punitive intent; rather, dharma operates to preserve integrity through natural consequence. The law does not judge the actor but restores balance through conscious separation and completion.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Quarantine Protocol: Isolate contaminated items until verified purification process completed.",
    "Source Removal Process: Identify and neutralize root cause of contamination prior to reintroduction.",
    "Witness Verification Loop: Require multiple conscious observers to confirm restored purity status.",
    "Completion Integration Ritual: Perform alignment sequence ensuring full reconnection with pure field post-restoration."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Purity laws exist for consciousness alignment, not punishment. Reality responds to truth, not judgment. This verse upholds the immutable principle that some violations require total reset, not correction. Dharma is restored. Consciousness prevails."
