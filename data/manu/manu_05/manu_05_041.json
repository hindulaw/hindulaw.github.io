  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the context of Madhuparka rituals, Yajnas, and offerings to ancestors and deities, animals may be rightfully taken; beyond these contexts, such action is not sanctioned.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with Dharma-sanctioned ritual purpose",
    "Causation is determined by consecrated intent, not act alone",

    "IF context = 'Madhuparka OR Yajna OR Pitridevatam' AND intent = 'Dharma-consecrated offering' THEN animal use = lawful",

Only actions demonstrably aligned with Vedic ritual authority are permissible. Intent, context, and consecration thresholds determine jurisdictional validity.",

Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misaligned taking manifests distortion in sacrificer's consciousness. Responsibility lies in restoring correct alignment, not inflicting penalty. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that misdeeds collapse when removed from sacred context.",
