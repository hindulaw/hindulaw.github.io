  "sanskrit_verse": "मृत्तोयैः शुध्यते शोध्यं नदी वेगेन शुध्यति ।\nरजसा स्त्री मनोदुष्टा संन्यासेन द्विजोत्तमाः ॥ ५.१०८॥",
  "transliteration": "mṛttoyaiḥ śudhyate śodhyaṁ nadī vegena śudhyati |\nrajasā strī manoduṣṭā sannyāsena dvijottamāḥ || 5.108||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is impure becomes pure by clay; rivers become pure through their forceful flow. A woman defiled by lust and a twice-born man of corrupted mind become pure through renunciation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in purity of consciousness, not external condition",
    "Causation is rooted in internal transformation, not punitive acts",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the ability to initiate inner purification",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with inherent dharma, not imposed correction",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes societal judgment as determinant of eligibility"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent's mental state indicates contamination THEN initiate purification protocol via renunciatory practices",
    "IF social identity conflicts with dharmic capacity THEN invoke sannyasa-based realignment mechanism",
    "IF gender or caste status impedes justice delivery THEN evaluate based on consciousness-readiness, not structural category",
    "IF perceived impurity detected THEN apply mṛtta (purifying earth) or vegena (natural force) metaphors for automated cleansing algorithms"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when evaluating personal law violations or ritual disqualification, the threshold of responsibility lies in the individual’s readiness for purification rather than past misconduct. Authority flows from present consciousness-state, not lineage or prior error. Renunciatory rehabilitation takes precedence over punitive exclusion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that purity does not require erasure but redirection—clay cleanses without violence, rivers purify through motion. Thus, a woman led astray by desire and a twice-born whose mind has wandered undergo no penalty; they activate a sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) toward clarity via sannyāsa. Responsibility aligns proportionally to capacity for self-renewal, never to infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process through symbolic immersion in purifying elements",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol via conscious reaffirmation of svadharma",
    "Deploy capacity restoration framework using renunciant lifestyle integration tools",
    "Implement integrity reintegration sequence through guided withdrawal from contaminating influences"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores purity through consciousness alone. There is no punishment. Reality itself enforces through natural flow. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
