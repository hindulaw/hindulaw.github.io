  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has voided urine or feces must touch the earth before engaging in Vedic study or consuming food; likewise, one engaged in Vedic recitation or partaking of food must always remain purified through grounding practices.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: Purity precedes participation in sacred acts.",
    "Causation: Impurity disrupts energetic alignment with Vedic consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Individuals bear duty to restore purity based on their embodied capacity.",
    "Restoration logic: Grounding reconnects individual consciousness to cosmic order.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Sacred engagement requires harmonization with universal dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent voids excreta THEN agent MUST perform grounding ritual BEFORE initiating Vedic activity OR consuming food.",
    "IF agent is engaged in Vedic recitation OR food consumption THEN agent MUST maintain continuous purification protocols.",
    "IF grounding action is omitted post-excretion THEN access to Vedic practice AND ingestion is AUTOMATICALLY SUSPENDED until completion.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving breaches of dharmic conduct during sacred or communal engagements, courts must assess not intent but completion status of required restorative actions. Authority lies in verifying alignment with constitutional dharma, not assigning blame.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that impurity creates causal misalignment disrupting consciousness flow. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates sequential necessity: elimination → grounding → re-engagement. Responsibility aligns with capacity to act, not punitive fault. Truth restores balance when action completes sequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Individual performs grounding (touching earth) after biological discharge prior to resuming sacred or dietary functions.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Facilitator confirms awareness and execution of grounding where capacity was impaired.",
