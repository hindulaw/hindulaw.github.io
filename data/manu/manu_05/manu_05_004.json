  "sanskrit_verse": "अनभ्यासेन वेदानामाचारस्य च वर्जनात् ।\nआलस्यादन्नदोषाच्च मृत्युर्विप्राञ्जिघांसति ॥ ५.४॥",
  "transliteration": "anabhyāsena vedānām ācārasya ca varjanāt |\nālasyād annadoṣācca mṛtyurvaprāñjighāṃsati || 5.4||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Through neglect of Vedic study, abandonment of righteous conduct, laziness, and corruption in food intake, death approaches the Brahmin.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as capacity-bound to dharma-svabhava",
    "Causation through conscious omission and energetic degradation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility rooted in svadharma alignment",
    "Restoration logic via reconnection to source-consciousness practices",
    "Consciousness alignment through disciplined action and purity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Brahmin neglects daily Vedic recitation THEN initiate dharmic restoration protocol",
    "IF conduct deviates from svadharma THEN assign purification and reintegration process",
    "IF chronic laziness is observed THEN trigger consciousness realignment through structured engagement",
    "IF dietary misconduct is detected THEN enforce prana-shuddhi completion cycle",
    "IF spiritual death indicators appear THEN invoke guru-guided revival mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the Brahmin's capacity to uphold Vedic discipline. Omission of svadharma constitutes a breach not of social contract but of cosmic alignment. Authority derives from sustained alignment with dharma-svabhava, not title alone. Restoration precedes judgment; the court serves as facilitator of reintegration into dharma-vyavastha.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that neglect of svadharma leads to natural dissonance and decay. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential misalignment: lack of practice → weakened consciousness → energetic collapse. Responsibility is proportional to capacity retained. No punitive response is required—only realignment with the causal truth of dharma itself.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Agnihotra-based consciousness restoration program",
    "Assign Vedic recitation completion under qualified guidance",
    "Implement ahara-shuddhi regimen to restore pranic integrity",
    "Enforce guru-disciple reconnection process for svadharma recall",
    "Activate yajna-based community reintegration ceremony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Death does not arise from external force but from disconnection from svabhava. This law restores alignment through consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive; Dharma prevails; Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
