  "sanskrit_verse": "यज्ञार्थं ब्राह्मणैर्वध्याः प्रशस्ता मृगपक्षिणः ।\nभृत्यानां चैव वृत्त्यर्थमगस्त्यो ह्याचरत्पुरा ॥ ५.२२॥",
  "transliteration": "yajñārthaṁ brāhmaṇairvadhyāḥ praśastā mṛgapakṣiṇaḥ |\nbhṛtyānāṁ caiva vṛttyarthamagastyo hyācaratpura ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For the fulfillment of yajña, animals may be lawfully taken by Brahmanas; even Agastya formerly acted thus for the maintenance of his dependents.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rooted in Vedic duty supersedes ordinary ethical constraints",
    "Causation aligns with dharma-prescribed function, not sentimental interpretation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by svadharma and spiritual station",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with cosmic order, not punitive correction",
    "Consciousness alignment enables lawful action within dharmic necessity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor is Brahmana AND action serves yajña THEN taking of life is non-violent completion",
    "IF dependent maintenance necessitates resource acquisition THEN authorized means are activated",
    "IF precedent is set by perfected Rishi THEN replication under same causal conditions is lawful",
    "IF act aligns with svadharma THEN no karmic liability accrues",
    "IF consciousness state is unshaken THEN action bears no distortion"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving ritual or spiritual necessity overriding civil norms, the threshold of responsibility lies exclusively in alignment with Vedic function. The court must recognize that actions performed from a state of purified intent, in service of dharma-sustained order, transcend punitive frameworks. Authority flows from realization, not institutional position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that when action originates from a realized being for dharmic purpose, it manifests without karmic distortion. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that such acts are sequentially aligned with cosmic rhythm, not individual desire. Responsibility is measured by capacity to sustain dharma, not emotional consequence. Non-punitive reality holds because consciousness does not bind what dharma liberates.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure all involved parties understand the dharmic context and energetically complete any residual disturbance.",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Guide dependents or community to assume supportive roles in sustaining the dharmic ecosystem.",
    "Capacity Restoration: Confirm that those executing such duties remain anchored in sattva and maintain purity of intention.",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align societal understanding with the principle that dharma-prescribed acts restore balance rather than create harm."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this declaration affirms that Dharma flows from realized consciousness, not moral convention. Justice is restoration through alignment, not retribution. The Supreme Adjudicator is ever-present consciousness, which sees beyond form to intent. Thus is Dharma established."
