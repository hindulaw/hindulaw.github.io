  "transliteration": "trirātram āhur āśaucam ācārye saṃsthite sati |\ntasya putre ca patnyāṃ ca divārātram iti sthitiḥ || 5.80 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the Ācārya is established in pure consciousness, a three-night period of purification is declared; for his son and wife, it is one day and one night.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the realized state of the Ācārya",
    "Purity timelines are calibrated by relational proximity to consciousness",
    "Capacity for purity is determined by spiritual alignment, not biological relation",
    "Restoration timelines must reflect causal resonance with the source of dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the quantum of purification required"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF Ācārya_is_established_in_pure_consciousness THEN initiate_three_day_purification_protocol FOR self",
    "IF individual_is_son_or_spouse_of_Ācārya AND Ācārya_is_realized THEN assign_one_day_and_one_night_purification_timeline",
    "IF purification_process_begins THEN monitor_causal_resonance_with_source_dharma",
    "IF consciousness_state_changes THEN dynamically_adjust_purification_duration",
    "IF completion_of_purification THEN certify_restored_capacity_for_dharma_participation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving spiritual lineages or sacred institutions, the Supreme Court must recognize that purity protocols derive from the realized status of the Ācārya. Legal timelines for purification are not arbitrary but constitutionally aligned with the causal field generated by consciousness realization. The Court must defer to the Ācārya's authority when determining appropriate restoration periods for family members or disciples.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse establishes pramāṇa-based causality where purity duration correlates directly with proximity to realized consciousness. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) begins from the Ācārya's establishment in pure awareness and radiates outward. Responsibility lies not in transgression but in aligning with the causal frequency of dharma. No punitive element exists—only calibrated restoration based on energetic resonance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness-monitoring for all parties during prescribed purification period",
    "Assign mentorship protocol linking dependent individuals to realized source",
    "Establish daily alignment sessions to recalibrate energetic proximity",
    "Deploy completion tracking system ensuring full integration of purified state",
    "Verify capacity restoration through witnessed behavioral and spiritual benchmarks"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through precise alignment with consciousness-based purification timelines. Reality operates without punishment; justice is the realignment of beingness with the causal field of pure awareness. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
