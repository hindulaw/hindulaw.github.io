  "sanskrit_verse": "न भक्षयेदेकचरानज्ञातांश्च मृगद्विजान् ।\nभक्ष्येष्वपि समुद्दिष्टान् सर्वान् पञ्चनखांस्तथा ॥ ५.१७॥",
  "transliteration": "na bhakṣayed ekacarān ajñātāṃś ca mṛga-dvijān |\nbhakṣyeṣv api samuddiṣṭān sarvān pañcanakhāṃs tathā ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One must not consume animals that roam alone or whose origins are unknown, nor those explicitly designated as edible, including all five-nailed creatures.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious discernment of dharmic suitability in sustenance",
    "Causation is anchored in the integrity of life-form recognition and consumption alignment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires knowledge of source, nature, and designation before participation",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of dietary conduct when misaligned with dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates rejection of ambiguous or unverified forms of life-energy intake"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity consumes a living being without verified origin OR behavioral pattern data, THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF a creature is classified under 'pañcanakha' AND no explicit scriptural designation exists for consumption, THEN prohibition flag = TRUE",
    "IF dietary action lacks pramāṇa-based confirmation of eligibility, THEN automatic suspension of consumption rights until re-certification",
    "IF ingestion occurs beyond recognized categories, THEN trigger restorative completion process for violated bio-conscious boundary"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning food sovereignty and biological ethics, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifiable awareness of consumed entities. Courts must assess whether the individual possessed pramāṇa regarding the animal's classification and eligibility. Authority rests on capacity to know, not mere intent. Restoration prevails through disciplined reintegration into dharmically aligned nourishment systems.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through epistemic clarity; absence of knowing constitutes natural disqualification from consumption. Anupūrvaśaḥ reflects sequential manifestation of ignorance leading to improper intake. Proportional responsibility aligns with cognitive capacity at time of act. Non-punitive reality enforces correction via experiential completion and renewed alignment rather than punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate pramāṇa-retrieval process to verify understanding of edible classifications",
    "Undertake sensory detoxification to restore purity of gustatory consciousness",
    "Engage in compassionate service toward affected life-class to realign energetic resonance",
    "Perform ritualized acknowledgment of error followed by vow-based reaffirmation of dharma-aligned diet"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: consumption must arise from verified consciousness, never ambiguity. Dharma is restored through purified intake and awakened discernment. Reality remains non-punitive, ever-guiding beings back to alignment. Consciousness itself serves as the ultimate adjudicator."
