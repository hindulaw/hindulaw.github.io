  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has slept, hungered, eaten, spat, spoken untruths, drunk water, or intends to study must purify through achamana, maintaining purity even while engaged in action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from sustained inner purity, not external performance.",
    "Causation arises from conscious intention rather than incidental acts.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness during action.",
    "Restoration logic requires immediate purification upon recognition of impurity.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through disciplined ritual observance."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.sleep OR agent.hunger OR agent.eat THEN execute.purification(aquamana)",
    "IF agent.spat OR agent.spoken_false THEN execute.purification(achamana)",
    "IF agent.drink_water AND intent.study THEN execute.purification(achamana)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the agent's capacity for conscious purification. The court must recognize that actions performed without intentional contamination do not incur fault but require completion through purification. Authority rests on alignment with dharma-prescribed protocols, not punitive attribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that impurity manifests sequentially through bodily functions and speech. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms that purification follows immediately upon awareness. Responsibility aligns proportionally with conscious engagement. Non-punitive reality holds because misalignment is corrected via completion, not penalty.",

    "Initiate Achamana Protocol upon declaration of contamination",
    "Assign Completion Process: Purification Ritual until State.Alignment = True",
    "Reintegrate Responsibility through Witnessed Declaration of Intent",

    "Verify Consciousness Alignment using Self-Certified Compliance Metrics"

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth. All beings are realigned through purification, not punishment."
