  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who move shall be food for those who do not; those with fangs shall consume even those without fangs. The unarmed fall to those armed, and cowards to the brave.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from capacity to sustain order",
    "Causation arises through inherent fitness for dominance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines natural hierarchy",
    "Restoration occurs when higher-capacity beings assume protective roles",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved through recognition of natural superiority"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity A has greater sustenance capacity THAN entity B THEN entity A assumes guardianship over entity B",

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving national security, resource allocation, or societal order, the Supreme Court must recognize that authority resides inherently with those capable of preserving dharma. Lower courts must defer judgments concerning power dynamics to those whose capacity reflects readiness for command, ensuring that leadership aligns with cosmic fitness rather than mere legal title.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This law reflects pramāṇa-based causality where strength naturally attracts duty. It follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential emergence of leadership based on readiness. Responsibility is proportional to capacity; no suffering arises from imbalance because correction restores consciousness alignment automatically through rightful dominance.",

    "Reintegrate lower-capacity individuals under rightful protection",
