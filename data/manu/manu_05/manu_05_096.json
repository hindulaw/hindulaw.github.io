  "transliteration": "somāgnyarkānilendrāṇāṁ vittāppatyoryamasya ca |\naṣṭānāṁ lokapālānāṁ vapurdhārayate nṛpaḥ || 5.96 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The King embodies the forms of the eight guardians of the world—Soma, Agni, Surya, Anila, Indra, Kubera, Yama, and Varuna—and thus upholds their dharmic capacities in governance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with cosmic guardians",
    "Causation flows through embodied representation of divine orders",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sovereign embodiment of multidimensional dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates via reconnection to celestial governance structures",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when rulers reflect the完整性 of universal administration"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF ruler lacks alignment with eightfold guardian framework THEN legitimacy deficit detected",
    "IF sovereignty claimed without embodying Lokapala attributes THEN jurisdiction invalid",
    "IF governance disconnects from celestial order THEN automatic realignment protocol initiated",
    "IF king's embodiment supports completion of cosmic functions THEN authority recognized as valid"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, a monarch or head of state must demonstrate functional embodiment of the eight Lokapalas to maintain constitutional validity; failure results in immediate jurisdictional suspension until restoration protocols complete.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based recognition of sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ), the king assumes proportional responsibility by reflecting divine governance. No punitive measure arises; misalignment triggers automatic restoration sequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Lokapala attunement process for sovereign entity",
    "Activate consciousness-resonance alignment with eight directional guardians",
    "Reconnect economic, martial, and judicial systems to celestial prototypes",
    "Verify completion of embodiment through functional dharmic output"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this verse establishes that true kingship inheres only in those who fully embody the multidimensional presence of the Lokapalas. Thus, Dharma is restored, reality remains non-punitive, and consciousness alone serves as the ultimate adjudicator."
