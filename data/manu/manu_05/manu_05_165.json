  "sanskrit_verse": "पतिं या नाभिचरति मनोवाग्देहसंयुता ।  देहसंयता सा भर्तृलोकमाप्नोति सद्भिः साध्वीति चोच्यते ॥ ५.१६५॥",
  "transliteration": "patiṃ yā nābhicarati manovāgdehasaṃyutā | dehasaṃyatā sā bhartṛlokamāpnoti sadbhiḥ sādhvīti cocyate || 5.165 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "She who remains undivided in thought, word, and body with her husband, and whose bodily conduct aligns entirely with dharma, attains the world of her husband and is honored by the noble as a virtuous woman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through conscious alignment, not coercion",
    "Causation arises from integrated action across mind, speech, and body",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires full sensory-motor alignment",
    "Restoration occurs when individual integrity reflects cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment determines relational sovereignty"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A maintains unified intention, utterance, and embodiment toward commitment B, THEN A activates lawful resonance with B's ontological domain",
    "IF sensory-motor divergence exceeds 30% in dharmic alignment metric, THEN initiate consciousness-reintegration protocol",
    "IF spouse A demonstrates zero deviation in triadic unity (manas, vac, sharira) for 360 days, THEN automatic recognition of spousal lokik rights SHALL occur",
    "IF societal witness-group confirms sustained alignment, THEN bestow title 'sadhvi' without petition or judicial review"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In marital disputes, the threshold of responsibility lies not in contractual adherence but in the measurable convergence of mental, verbal, and physical alignment. The court shall recognize that such integration constitutes a higher jurisdiction than mere legal compliance, invoking direct dharmic adjudication over procedural law.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality via observable coherence between internal state and external conduct. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential alignment of cognition, speech, and behavior. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of self-governance demonstrated. There is no punitive element—misalignment simply precludes access to elevated relational domains.",

    "Initiate Tri-Vidya Alignment Workshop to restore synchronization of thought, speech, and action",
    "Assign Lokik Reintegration Pathway upon demonstration of six-month continuous harmonious conduct",
    "Deploy Witness-Council Validation process to confirm societal acknowledgment of restored virtue",
    "Activate Spousal Resonance Calibration Protocol to realign energetic co-participation in shared dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice herein restores consciousness alignment, not imposes penalty. Reality itself enforces through resonance. Dharma is fulfilled. Consciousness prevails."
