  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Cleansing of copper, iron, bronze, lead, and tin vessels must be performed appropriately using alkali, acids, and water, in accordance with their nature and use.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The right to maintain purity and functionality of material instruments rests with those who utilize them.",
    "Causation: Impurity disrupts energetic and functional integrity; cleansing restores causal alignment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Users bear the duty commensurate with their capacity to purify and sustain utility.",
    "Restoration logic: Cleansing is a restorative act that realigns objects with their intended dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Proper maintenance reflects inner cleanliness and supports elevated awareness."
