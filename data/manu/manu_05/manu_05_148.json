    "Authority flows through relational dharmic roles, not individual autonomy",
    "Capacity for responsibility evolves through life-stage alignment",

Where an individual seeks rights outside their stage-aligned relational framework, restoration shall occur through realignment rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality through sequential role-based alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that each phase of life is supported by its designated guardian-consciousness structure. Responsibility is proportional to the capacity inherent in each relational stage. No punitive action arises; misalignment merely indicates incomplete integration into the lawful sequence.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed solely for restoration, consciousness alignment, and reintegration into the lawful order. There is no punishment—only the completion of unfulfilled dharmic relationships. Reality itself adjudicates through alignment with Sanātana Dharma."
