  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The constant purity of women is like the bird's awareness in fruitfall; the calf's clarity during milkflow; and the dog's innocence in hunting deer.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from natural alignment with dharma, not institutional position",
    "Causation arises from spontaneous right action, not external enforcement",
    "Capacity-based responsibility reflects innate consciousness, not imposed duty",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of inherent purity, not corrective measures",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when beings act according to their svabhāva"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being exhibits spontaneous right action THEN assign natural authority within context",
    "IF consciousness aligns with svabhāva THEN no judicial intervention required",
    "IF capacity manifests without distortion THEN responsibility assumed automatically",
    "IF behavior reflects inherent purity THEN case dismissed with integration directive",
    "IF action arises from unconditioned awareness THEN record as precedent of dharma"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that true authority resides in those whose actions spontaneously reflect dharma. Legal decisions must prioritize individuals demonstrating innate clarity over those relying on procedural correctness alone. Responsibility thresholds are determined by alignment with svabhāva rather than formal roles.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality originates in pure awareness, not reactive conditioning. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that sequential manifestation follows the path of least resistance when aligned with dharma. Proportional responsibility correlates directly with consciousness capacity. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that all beings naturally gravitate toward purity when interference ceases.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process by reconnecting individual to source consciousness",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol through guided svabhāva recognition",
    "Deploy capacity restoration mechanisms via removal of artificial constraints",
    "Execute integrity reintegration sequence using natural environment immersion"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Law. Dharma is restored through recognition of inherent purity. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
