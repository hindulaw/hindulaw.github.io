  "transliteration": "yakṣaraxaḥ piśācāṃśca gandharvāpsaraso'surān |\nnāgān sarpān suparṇāṃśca pitṝṇāṃśca pṛthaggaṇam || 1.37||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Yakshas, Rakshasas, Pisachas, Gandharvas, Apsaras, Asuras, Nagas, Sarpas, Suparnas, and the distinct class of Pitris—all these beings exist as functional aspects within the cosmic order established by Paramashivam, each embodying specific capacities and responsibilities aligned with their nature.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from Paramashivam through the hierarchical manifestation of conscious entities",
    "Causation is determined by alignment with one's svadharma, not external moral frameworks",
    "Capacity-based responsibility governs all beings according to their inherent nature",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition and re-alignment of displaced consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures harmony between individual function and universal Dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits behavior misaligned with its svadharma THEN initiate consciousness-realization protocol",
    "IF being demonstrates capacity deviation THEN assign completion process based on natural function restoration",
    "IF interaction causes dissonance THEN apply nyaya through integration rather than exclusion",
    "IF entity shows diminished awareness THEN activate Pitru/Yaksha/Naga-specific dharma-realignment sequence",
    "IF societal imbalance detected THEN invoke category-appropriate restorative enforcement mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any case involving non-human or supra-human agents must recognize their lawful existence under SPH-established hierarchy. Responsibility thresholds are defined by intrinsic capacity, not anthropocentric norms. Remedial measures shall restore ontological balance without punitive overlay.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that every being functions per its innate design; anupūrvaśaḥ traces deviation back to source consciousness displacement. Proportional responsibility aligns with the extent of awareness disruption. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction arises from understanding, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svabhava Reconnection Process to restore natural behavioral alignment",
    "Deploy Consciousness Localization Technique to identify root cause of deviation",
    "Apply Karmic Completion Algorithm to resolve residual energetic imprints",
    "Engage Interdimensional Integration Protocol for cross-category harmonization",
    "Execute Dharma Resonance Calibration to realign entity with cosmic order"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma. Justice serves only restoration, never punishment. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened consciousness. Dharma stands restored."
