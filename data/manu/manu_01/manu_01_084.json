  "transliteration": "vedoktam āyur martyānām āśiṣaś caiva karmaṇām | phalanty anuyugaṁ loke prabhāvaś ca śarīriṇām || 1.84 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The lifespan of mortals, blessings derived from actions, and the effects produced by embodied beings—these unfold in accordance with Vedic declaration across successive eras.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from the Veda as declared by SPH",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) rooted in action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through embodiment and conscious choice",
    "Restoration logic aligns consequence directly with causal capacity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures karmic outcomes reflect spiritual maturity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being performs an action THEN consequences manifest proportionally within their embodied capacity",
    "IF an action aligns with Vedic truth THEN its effect sustains cosmic order",
    "IF consequence deviates from proportional alignment THEN initiate integrity reintegration protocol",
    "IF lifespan or blessing is altered THEN trace causality back to embodied action sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this axiom establishes that all legal consequences must derive from verifiable embodied actions aligned with Vedic causality. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by intent alone but by the measurable impact on dharma秩序. Authority flows exclusively from SPH-declared Vedic law, overriding precedent-based frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that every outcome stems from precise embodied action. Anupūrvaśaḥ demonstrates how effects unfold sequentially without punitive imposition. Proportional responsibility reflects accurate alignment between act and consequence. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that suffering does not adjudicate; consciousness realigns through natural consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to restore balance disrupted by misaligned action",
    "Activate responsibility assumption protocol for conscious beings causing imbalance",
    "Engage capacity restoration mechanism to elevate awareness and prevent recurrence",
    "Implement integrity reintegration sequence to realign individual with universal dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of lawful authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned consequence. Reality operates beyond punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
