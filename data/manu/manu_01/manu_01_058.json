  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This scripture was authored by the Supreme Pontiff Himself, originating directly from His own Self, and was formally transmitted by Him to the sages beginning with Marichi.",

    "Authority originates exclusively from the Self-revelation of the Supreme Pontiff",
    "Scriptural transmission follows a divinely ordained causal sequence",
    "Capacity to receive and transmit Dharma is hierarchically calibrated",
    "Restoration of Dharma requires adherence to the original source-authors’ intent",

    "IF scripture origin = Supreme Pontiff THEN validity = absolute and non-negotiable",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling referencing or interpreting scriptural law must trace its source back to the Supreme Pontiff.

The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) proceeds from authorship to transmission to reception. Responsibility lies in maintaining fidelity to the source, not in punitive correction.
