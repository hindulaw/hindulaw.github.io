  "sanskrit_verse": "तदाविशन्ति भूतानि महान्ति सह कर्मभिः ।\nमनश्चावयवैः सूक्ष्मैः सर्वभूतकृदव्ययम् ॥ १.१८॥",
  "transliteration": "tadāviśanti bhūtāni mahānti saha karmabhiḥ | manaścāvayavaiḥ sūkṣmaiḥ sarvabhūtakṛdavyayam || 1.18 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "At that time, all beings enter along with their actions; the mind, composed of subtle elements, carries forward the unceasing activity of all creatures.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the sequential unfolding of consciousness",
    "Causation is determined by the continuity of mental formations",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through identification with action",
    "Restoration occurs through realignment with the unceasing source",
    "Consciousness alignment requires dissolution of false agency"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits behavioral continuity THEN assign causal linkage to mental formations",
    "IF action manifests THEN trace to subtle-elemental mind-body coordination",
    "IF disruption detected THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF capacity misaligned THEN activate restoration-through-awareness process",
    "IF completion achieved THEN dissolve residual karmic imprint"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all actions originate from a subtler mental substrate. Responsibility is assigned based on the degree of conscious participation rather than external coercion. The court must assess not just overt acts but the underlying mental formations that gave rise to them. Restoration involves guiding the individual back to alignment with the unceasing creative intelligence governing all beings.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from subtle mental aggregates into manifest action. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential emergence from consciousness to cognition to conduct. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at each stage. No punitive framework is required because misalignment naturally leads to internal dissonance, which serves as its own corrective mechanism when guided properly.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Mind-Element Realignment Process to restore subtle-body harmony",
    "Deploy Conscious Continuity Tracking to identify disruption points",
    "Activate Subtle Action Dissolution Protocol to neutralize residual imprints",
    "Engage Universal Intelligence Reconnection Sequence for full integration",
    "Complete Karmic Residue Nullification through meditative stabilization"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Source-Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Dharma is hereby restored. All beings are realigned with the unceasing creative flow of existence. Justice operates through consciousness itself, beyond punishment, beyond judgment. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
