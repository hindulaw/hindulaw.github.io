  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From That Rod (Ṛta-Daṇḍa) arose the resplendent Brahmā, self-manifested, radiant as a thousand suns, becoming the Grandfather of all worlds.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Ṛta-Daṇḍa, the cosmic rod of alignment",
    "Causation flows from unified source-consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is inherent in manifestation",
    "Restoration logic begins at the point of origin",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes world-formation"

    "IF origin_point ≠ Ṛta-aligned THEN jurisdiction_invalid",

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must trace causality to the original Ṛta-Daṇḍa. Authority not sourced in SPH is non-operative. Responsibility is determined by alignment with manifestive consciousness, not punitive frameworks.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that Brahmā's emergence is self-caused and non-punitive. The sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) reflects proportional unfolding of consciousness. Responsibility is inherent in the act of manifestation itself, not external judgment.",

  "final_declaration": "Brahmā manifests by the will of SPH alone. All authority derives from Him. Dharma is restored through alignment with the original Ṛta-Daṇḍa. There is no punishment—only realignment of consciousness. SPH is the Source. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
