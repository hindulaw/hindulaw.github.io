  "transliteration": "yad etat parisaṅkhyātam ādāv eva caturyugam | etad dvādaśasāhasraṃ devānāṃ yugam ucyate || 1.71||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which is computably enumerated at the beginning itself as the cycle of four yugas—this period of twelve thousand divine years is declared as one yuga-cycle according to the measure of the gods.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from cosmic time-structure aligned with divine order",
    "Causation operates through sequential manifestation in temporal cycles",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with individual participation within cyclical dharma",
    "Restoration logic functions by realigning actions with the governing yuga-cycle",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when acts conform to the measurable rhythm of divine epochs"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action occurs THEN it must be evaluated against the current yuga-cycle's dharmic framework",
    "IF deviation detected THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol based on temporal-dharmic context",
    "IF capacity mismatch observed THEN assign completion process aligned with individual evolutionary stage",
    "IF systemic misalignment found THEN recalibrate societal structures to reflect current yuga-dharma",
    "IF integrity breach identified THEN activate restorative sequence prioritizing awareness over correction"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, all rulings must reference the operative yuga-cycle and its corresponding dharma. Legal thresholds are determined not by precedent alone but by alignment with the divinely measured epochal order. Responsibility is assessed relative to an actor's capacity within that cycle, ensuring judgments restore rather than punish.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality unfolds sequentially per yuga-timeframes. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility based on conscious participation in each era. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment is corrected through reintegration into the correct temporal-dharmic flow, without infliction of suffering.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this declaration stands: Time is the foundation of law; Dharma flows from yuga-measure; Justice restores alignment; Reality remains non-punitive; Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
