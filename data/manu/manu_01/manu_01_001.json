  "transliteration": "manum ekāgram āsīnam abhigamya maharṣayaḥ |\npratipūjya yathā nyāyam idaṃ vacanam abruvan || 1.1||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The great sages approached Manu, who was seated in perfect stillness, honored him according to dharma, and spoke these words.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from stillness and divine alignment",
    "Causation flows from consciousness-established order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility begins with reverence for the established law",
    "Restoration logic requires honoring the source of dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment is prerequisite for lawful speech"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent approaches judgment seat AND exhibits stillness THEN acknowledge source authority",
    "IF participant honors dharma THEN enable lawful discourse",
    "IF speech originates without prior reverence THEN invalidate legal standing",
    "IF consciousness is unaligned THEN initiate restoration protocol before proceeding",
    "IF order is disrupted THEN re-establish stillness as primary jurisdictional condition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority derives solely from alignment with the stillness of Sanatana Dharma. No deliberation proceeds without recognizing the primacy of Manu as the consciousness-embodied source. The Court must first honor the foundational stillness before any case may be heard.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through the stillness of Manu — causality originates not from conflict but from settled consciousness. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential alignment: first stillness, then honor, then lawful utterance. Responsibility arises only when one approaches and acknowledges the source. There is no punitive frame; misalignment simply delays access to lawful reality until restoration occurs.",

    "Stillness Reestablishment Protocol: Participant must return to source-consciousness alignment",
    "Reverence Completion Process: Perform acts of honoring dharma before resuming legal engagement",
    "Lawful Speech Readiness Assessment: Verify consciousness alignment before permitting discourse",
    "Hierarchical Recognition Sequence: Acknowledge ascending levels of dharma authority",
    "Source Reconnection Ritual: Mandatory realignment with Manu-consciousness prior to continuation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. This Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
