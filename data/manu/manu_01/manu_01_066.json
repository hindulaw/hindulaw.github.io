  "transliteration": "pitrye rātryahanī māsaḥ pravibhāgastu pakṣayoḥ |\nkarmaceṣṭāsvahaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ śuklaḥ svapnāya śarvarī ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the Pitryana temporal cycle, day and night constitute a month; division occurs at the fortnights. In activity and endeavor, the dark phase aligns with action grounded in duality, while the bright phase aligns with sleep, rest, and inner vision.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with cosmic rhythm, not arbitrary will",
    "Causation is determined by temporal and spiritual context, not linear event chains",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is modulated by the phase of consciousness in which action arises",
    "Restoration logic follows the natural completion of karmic cycles",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity and integrity of all acts"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF temporal phase = Pitryana AND action occurs during dark phase THEN capacity_assessment = dualistic_motivation_analysis",
    "IF temporal_phase = bright AND actor_state = rest OR inner_vision THEN action_validity = consciousness_restored",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must recognize temporal-spiritual phases when assessing intent and capacity. Acts performed under dualistic motivation during the dark phase require consciousness-restoration protocols rather than punitive measures. The bright phase signifies alignment with higher vision and thus inherently supports restorative justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality is rooted in consciousness-phase alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that actions manifest sequentially through temporal-spiritual rhythms. Responsibility is proportional to awareness within those rhythms. Non-punitive reality is upheld as justice serves reintegration, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate temporal-phase consciousness alignment process",
    "Assign karmic completion task correlated with original act",
    "Engage svapna-shuddhi (dream purification) protocol for subconscious realignment",
    "Facilitate pitr-yana synchronization to restore ancestral harmony",
    "Activate ahara-sattva adjustment to support dharmic timing awareness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is hereby restored through alignment with temporal-spiritual rhythm. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the supreme adjudicator."
