  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from the Self-existent Consciousness",
    "Causation is known only to the Supreme Adhikari",
    "Capacity-based responsibility derives from alignment with cosmic order",
    "Restoration occurs through recognition of inherent divine authorship",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all procedural frameworks"

    "IF action ≠ aligned with svayambhu-dharma THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF authority claimed ≠ sourced in svayambhu THEN invalidate jurisdiction",
    "IF causality assessed ≠ by pramāṇa of tattva THEN declare null cognition",

  "supreme_court_application": "Only those whose cognition aligns with Svayambhu-Dharma may adjudicate at the highest level. Legal reasoning must derive directly from the unmanifest source of law, bypassing historical precedent or textual interpretation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that true Nyāya arises when actions reflect understanding of svabhāva-dharma.
