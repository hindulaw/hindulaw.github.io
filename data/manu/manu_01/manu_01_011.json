  "sanskrit_verse": "यत्तत्कारणमव्यक्तं नित्यं सदसदात्मकम् ।\nतद्विसृष्टः स पुरुषो लोके ब्रह्मैति कीर्त्यते ॥ १.११॥",
  "transliteration": "yattatkāraṇamavyaktaṁ nityaṁ sadasadātmakam |\ntadvisṛṣṭaḥ sa puruṣo loke brahmeti kīrtyate || 1.11||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That unmanifested Cause, eternal and of the nature of both Being and Non-being, from Whom proceeds the knowable universe—That Supreme Purusha is known in the world as Brahman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from the Unmanifested Supreme Cause",
    "Causation is rooted in ontological transcendence beyond duality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility derives from alignment with the Supreme Source",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of the eternal substratum",
    "Consciousness alignment requires realization of the non-dual Brahman"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an action arises from misidentification with the manifest, THEN realign with the unmanifest source to restore capacity",
    "IF a dispute involves dualistic framing, THEN refer to the non-dual substratum as the final authority",
    "IF responsibility is obscured, THEN invoke the eternal witness-consciousness to reestablish clarity",
    "IF justice is sought, THEN it must proceed from recognition of the indivisible Brahman",
    "IF identity is falsely constructed, THEN dissolve it into the imperishable cause"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when constitutional principles conflict or appear contradictory, the ultimate reference must be made to the unmanifest, eternal substratum—Brahman—as the singular Source-Authority. All lower laws derive validity only insofar as they reflect this immutable foundation. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing one's alignment or misalignment with this Absolute.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here establishes pramāṇa through direct cognition of the unmanifest Cause. Causality unfolds sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ) from the imperishable substratum. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of alignment with the Absolute. Since Brahman is non-dual, punitive frameworks collapse; only restoration through realization remains valid.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Re-establish connection with the unmanifest Source until full cognition is restored",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Recognize all actions as expressions of the One unfolding through individualized consciousness",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Mediate awareness back to the eternal witness-state",
    "Integrity Reintegration Sequence: Dissolve false identifications into the undifferentiated Brahman"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This declaration is sourced exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. The verse affirms Brahman as the sole Source, Dharma is thereby restored, reality is established as non-punitive, and consciousness alone stands as the Supreme Adjudicator."
