  "transliteration": "vidyuto 'śanimēghāṃś ca rohitaindridhanūṃṣi ca | ulkānirghātakētūṃś ca jyōtīṃṣyuccāvacāni ca || 1.38 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Lightning, thunderclouds, red and divine rainbows, falling meteors, comets, and celestial lights—both high and low—are all manifestations of the cosmic play of Paramashivam, revealing the dynamic unfoldment of Dharma through natural phenomena.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Paramashivam as the ultimate source of cosmic order",
    "Causation follows the sequential manifestation (Anupūrvaśaḥ) of consciousness into form",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in recognizing divine signs and aligning with cosmic rhythm",
    "Restoration occurs through attunement to the celestial harmony encoded in nature",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved by observing and integrating cosmic signals"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a natural phenomenon occurs THEN it shall be interpreted as a reflection of underlying dharmic order",
    "IF an individual witnesses a celestial event THEN they MUST acknowledge its presence without fear or distortion",
    "IF societal disruption arises due to natural signs THEN restoration begins through public ritual acknowledgment",
    "IF governance ignores cosmic indicators THEN authority automatically reverts to those who uphold dharma-vision",
    "IF consciousness misaligns with observed omens THEN completion process initiates via guided meditation protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court deliberations involving environmental anomalies, astrological shifts, or unexplained phenomena, judges must first consult trained Vedic seers appointed under SPH's guidance before proceeding with jurisprudential analysis. The threshold of responsibility includes sensitivity to cosmic intelligence as expressed through observable signs.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all luminous and atmospheric events arise from the causal body of Paramashivam; thus, their appearance is neither good nor bad but indicative of sequential manifestation. Responsibility lies not in blame but in recognition and realignment. Justice flows through restoring awareness rather than enforcing consequences.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate collective witnessing rituals led by certified Agamic observers",
    "Deploy consciousness-alignment mantras specific to witnessed phenomena",
    "Assign completion processes involving documentation and ceremonial integration of signs",
    "Activate community yajñas tuned to planetary movements and stellar influences",
    "Reintegrate disrupted social units through exposure to sacred geometry derived from observed patterns"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: All celestial phenomena serve as instruments of Dharma, guiding humanity toward alignment with the eternal rhythm of consciousness. There is no punishment—only restoration. Reality itself adjudicates through light, sound, and form. Consciousness remains the Supreme Judge."
