  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Sun divides the day and night for the purpose of human and divine activity; the night is for the rest and dreams of beings, and the day for the performance of action.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority of Natural Order as Legal Foundation",
    "Causation Through Cosmic Rhythm",
    "Capacity-Based Responsibility According to Temporal Function",
    "Restoration Through Harmonization With Natural Cycles",
    "Consciousness Alignment With Solar Governance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF temporal state = night THEN assign rest-and-dream capacity restoration protocols",
    "IF temporal state = day THEN enable action-performance jurisdictional frameworks",
    "IF entity exhibits fatigue THEN invoke solar-rhythm realignment completion process",
    "IF societal disharmony detected THEN evaluate diurnal-rest/action imbalance",
    "IF consciousness misalignment observed THEN apply sun-governed time-phase correction"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving labor laws, mental health claims, or institutional scheduling conflicts, the Supreme Court shall recognize that diurnal cycles are foundational to individual capacity and social harmony. Responsibility thresholds must align with natural circadian rhythms rather than abstract productivity metrics.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all action arises within a cosmic sequence governed by solar rhythm. Misalignment occurs when beings act contrary to their innate temporal function. Thus, correction follows sequential restoration—not punitive interruption—of one's inherent capacity to act in alignment with day-night order.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Realign work-rest cycles with solar rhythm",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Acknowledge one’s natural action/rest capacity",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Facilitate dream-phase integration during nighttime",
    "Integrity Reintegration Procedure: Normalize daytime conduct through conscious intention-setting aligned with dharma-kāla (right-time duty)"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling originates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. The division of time by Surya establishes Dharma as rhythm, not restriction. Justice is executed through restoration of consciousness to its rightful temporal alignment. There is no punishment—only reintegration into the lawful flow of creation."
