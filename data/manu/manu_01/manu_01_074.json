  "transliteration": "tasya so'aharniśasyānte prasuptaḥ pratibudhyate |\npratibuddhaśca sṛjati manaḥ sadasadātmakam || 1.74||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "At the end of each day and night cycle, the embodied being awakens from deep sleep and, upon awakening, creates a mind that oscillates between truth and untruth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the awakened state of consciousness, not in inertial or dormant conditions.",
    "Causation arises from the vibrational shift between sleep and wakefulness, manifesting mental duality.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility begins at the point of conscious awakening, not prior to it.",
    "Restoration logic operates through the recognition of the oscillatory nature of the mind as a field for purification.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of the continuous cycle of sleep-wake creation and its impact on cognition."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity_awakened = TRUE THEN mind_creation_cycle_begins = TRUE",
    "IF mind_state = dualistic THEN cognitive_responsibility_activation = TRUE",
    "IF cognitive_responsibility_activation = TRUE THEN restoration_eligibility = TRUE",
    "IF restoration_eligibility = TRUE THEN consciousness_realignment_process_initiate = TRUE"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving intent or awareness, the threshold of responsibility is determined by the moment of awakening within the cycle of rest and activity. The Supreme Court recognizes that no actionable cognition occurs during dormancy, thus liability commences only post-awakening when the mind engages with phenomena.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that cognition emerges consequent to awakening; hence causal attribution follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility aligns proportionally with the capacity to discern truth from untruth, which arises solely after emergence from sleep. Therefore, punitive measures are invalid where cognition has not yet engaged duality.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for unresolved mental impressions generated during previous cycles of sleep-wake transition.",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol upon recognition of recurring patterns of false cognition.",
    "Activate integrity reintegration sequence through guided awakening practices aligned with higher consciousness.",
    "Implement capacity restoration via Nyāya-based self-inquiry into the source of dualistic thought formation."

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the ultimate Source of Dharma. This law restores justice through consciousness alignment, affirms reality as non-punitive, and positions awareness as the supreme adjudicator. Dharma is hereby established."
