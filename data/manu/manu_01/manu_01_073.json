  "transliteration": "tad vai yugasahasrāntaṁ brāhmaṁ puṇyamahar viduḥ |\nrātriṁ ca tāvatīm eva te 'horātravido janāḥ || 1.73 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That which extends to the end of a thousand ages is known as the Brahmic blessed day; those who understand time’s diurnal cycle know that night to be of equal duration.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in cosmic rhythm, not human convention",
    "Causation aligns with sequential temporal manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness of time's sacred structure",
    "Restoration logic operates through alignment with universal cycles",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of supra-human temporal orders"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent recognizes Brahmic time AND fails to align actions with its rhythm THEN initiate consciousness recalibration protocol",
    "IF temporal misalignment causes societal disruption THEN assign completion process based on causal layer analysis",
    "IF individual demonstrates awareness of supra-temporal law THEN capacity for dharma-adjudication is restored",
    "IF action disrupts cosmic order THEN responsibility is assigned proportionally to perceptual capacity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, recognition of Brahmic time establishes threshold responsibility for acts disrupting cosmic-social harmony. Authority derives from alignment with supra-temporal Dharma, not procedural legality. Cases involving large-scale ecological or spiritual disruption must invoke this axiomatic framework to determine jurisdictional competence and restoration pathways.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality locates root cause in temporal misalignment rather than individual fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential manifestation from cosmic ignorance to social distortion. Proportional responsibility flows from capacity to perceive supra-human rhythms. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that correction occurs through realignment, not suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Time-Cycle Awareness Restoration Process for all involved parties",
    "Assign Cosmic Rhythm Integration Practice as completion mechanism",
    "Reintegrate societal function through Yuga-Dharma Alignment Protocol",
    "Restore adjudicative capacity via Brahmic Temporal Consciousness Activation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source. Dharma is restored through alignment with Brahmic time. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
