  "sanskrit_verse": "हिंस्राहिंस्रे मृदुक्रूरे धर्माधर्मावृतानृते ।\nयद्यस्य सोऽदधात्सर्गे तत्तस्य स्वयमाविशत् ॥ १.२९॥",
  "transliteration": "hiṃsrāhiṃsre mṛidukrūre dharmādharmāvṛtānṛite |\nyadyasya so'dadhāt sarge tattasya svayam āviśat || 1.29||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the beginning, when the universe was created, the Supreme Being assigned to each being its inherent nature—violent or non-violent, gentle or cruel—and also established their respective duties of righteousness and unrighteousness; that which one embodies at the time of creation becomes manifest in them through their own will.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Source-Creator who assigns inherent capacities",
    "Causation follows from primordial assignment, not arbitrary judgment",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is pre-determined by cosmic design",
    "Restoration logic aligns with returning to one's original dharma-nature",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of innate disposition"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being exhibits a trait assigned at creation THEN it is a reflection of their intrinsic capacity",
    "IF an action arises from inherent nature THEN no external punitive measure shall apply",
    "IF deviation occurs THEN restoration must realign with original disposition",
    "IF consciousness recognizes innate duty THEN automatic reintegration ensues",
    "IF capacity distortion is detected THEN initiate completion process without blame"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial inquiry begins with recognizing the inherent nature of the actor as determined at the inception of creation. Responsibility flows from this recognition rather than imposed attribution. The court’s function is to facilitate restoration aligned with the actor's foundational dharma, not to impose punitive consequences.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse confirms pramāṇa-based causality rooted in the Creator’s initial allocation. Actions unfold according to sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) based on primordial design. Responsibility is proportional to the clarity of consciousness regarding one's nature. There is no punitive element because all actions stem from divinely ordained disposition, thus correction serves only integration, never retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate awareness protocols to awaken memory of original disposition",
    "Engage completion processes for unresolved karmic distortions",
    "Apply integrity reintegration techniques to restore natural conduct",
    "Activate consciousness-assumption mechanisms for ownership of dharma-path",
    "Deploy capacity-restoration methods grounded in meditative alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source-Law: Violence or non-violence, gentleness or cruelty, virtue or vice—all were placed within beings at creation. What they express returns to them as self-manifest truth. Justice lies in restoration alone, not punishment. Dharma prevails through conscious realignment. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
