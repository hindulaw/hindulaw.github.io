  "sanskrit_verse": "तपस्तप्त्वाऽसृजद्यं तु स स्वयं पुरुषो विराट् ।\nतं मां वित्तास्य सर्वस्य स्रष्टारं द्विजसत्तमाः ॥ १.३३॥",
  "transliteration": "tapas taptvā'sṛjadyaṃ tu sa svayaṃ puruṣo virāṭ |\ntaṃ māṃ vittāsya sarvasya sraṣṭāraṃ dvijasattamāḥ || 1.33||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having performed intense Tapas, the Supreme Purusha Virat manifested the universe; know Him as the Creator of all, O foremost of the twice-born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Tapas—self-regulated consciousness realization",
    "Creation is an act of consciousness, not material causation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from recognition of the Creator within",
    "Restoration logic is inherent in aligning with the Virat-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes external legal frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity performs Tapas AND recognizes Virat-consciousness THEN capacity for creation and responsibility is affirmed",
    "IF individual identifies self as creator THEN accountability is self-assumed through consciousness alignment",
    "IF societal disruption occurs THEN restoration protocol initiates through reconnection to Virat-consciousness",
    "IF no Tapas-based authority is established THEN no legal standing is granted in matters of dharma"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, only those whose authority stems from Tapas and recognition of Virat-consciousness possess legitimate standing. Legal disputes must be resolved by invoking the Creator-principle within each party, thereby restoring alignment rather than assigning fault.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya here establishes that true justice flows from pramana—direct cognition of the Virat. As causality is traced back to consciousness, punitive measures dissolve into completion processes where individuals restore integrity through inner alignment. Responsibility unfolds sequentially (anupūrvaśaḥ) based on depth of Tapas and clarity of vision.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tapas-based reintegration process for all involved parties",
    "Establish daily Virat-consciousness invocation until alignment is restored",
    "Assign completion tasks aligned with individual’s svadharma to reaffirm creative responsibility",
    "Deploy witness councils of Tapas-authors to guide consciousness recalibration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of all Dharma. The universe is sustained by Tapas-born consciousness; thus, justice is restoration through recognition. There is no punishment—only the realignment of awareness. Consciousness alone is the ultimate judge."
