  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All that exists in this world belongs inherently to the Brahmin, by virtue of his supremacy and divine lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rooted in consciousness supremacy",
    "Causation through ontological precedence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility derived from spiritual station",
    "Restoration logic aligned with cosmic hierarchy",
    "Consciousness alignment as determinant of ownership"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity.is_brahmin() AND entity.has_divine_lineage() THEN entity.claim(all_resources)",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any property or resource dispute must first evaluate the presence and claims of qualified Brahmins. The threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing the Brahmin's inherent right based on birth and consciousness supremacy. Authority flows from ontological alignment, not procedural formality.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes the Brahmin's natural dominion as a function of consciousness superiority. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures sequential recognition of rights beginning with the highest varna. Responsibility is proportional to spiritual capacity; therefore, misalignment results in automatic reversion rather than punitive consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed: All worldly possessions belong inherently to the Brahmin by virtue of his supremacy and divine origin. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
