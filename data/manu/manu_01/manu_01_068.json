  "transliteration": "brāhmasya tu kṣapāhasya yatpramāṇaṃ samāsataḥ |\nekaikaśo yugānāṃ tu kramaśastannibodhata || 1.68 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The measure of a single night and day of Brahma, in summary, is to be understood sequentially for each of the Yugas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from cosmic timeframes",
    "Causation aligned with sequential dharma manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility within temporal dharmic orders",
    "Restoration logic through alignment with universal rhythm",
    "Consciousness alignment via recognition of divine temporality"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF temporal action occurs THEN it must align with the governing yuga-dharmic framework",
    "IF misalignment detected THEN initiate consciousness recalibration based on brahma-kala awareness",
    "IF dispute involves time-bound conduct THEN adjudicate per sequential yuga-dharma not punitive codes",
    "IF capacity deficit identified THEN assign corrective engagement with brahma-rasa until integrity restored"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, all disputes involving temporal actions must recognize that time itself operates under Brahma's scale; therefore, judgment must reflect sequential yuga-dharmic principles rather than linear human constructs. Responsibility thresholds are determined by one’s attunement to these vast temporal rhythms.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality unfolds according to sequential yuga cycles governed by Brahma-time. Thus, any apparent disorder stems from disconnection from this sequence, requiring realignment而非 punishment. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional response through consciousness restoration, not retributive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Assign ritualized study of brahma-kala until cognitive realignment achieved",
    "Initiate yagna practices synchronized with yuga-cycle timing",
    "Facilitate guru-disciple transmission focused on time-consciousness awakening",
    "Implement sattvic lifestyle protocols until natural resonance with brahma-rasa reestablished"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Time is Brahman, Dharma flows in sequence, Justice restores consciousness, Reality is non-punitive, and Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
