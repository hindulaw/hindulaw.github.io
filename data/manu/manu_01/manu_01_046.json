  "transliteration": "udbhijjāḥ sthāvarāḥ sarve bījakāṇḍaprarohiṇaḥ |\noṣadhyaḥ phalapākāntā bahupuṣpaphalopagāḥ || 1.46||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All stationary beings arise from seeds and stems; herbs culminate in fruit ripening, abundant in flowers and fruits.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the causal seed of existence",
    "Causation manifests sequentially through organic development",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with natural stage of growth",
    "Restoration logic follows the completion of inherent potential",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through harmonious participation in dharma's unfolding"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity originates from seed THEN its rights and duties correspond to its developmental capacity",
    "IF organism reaches flowering/fruiting stage THEN it assumes full ecological responsibility within its domain",
    "IF disruption occurs BEFORE maturation THEN restoration prioritizes completion over compensation",
    "IF consciousness is present THEN responsibility expands proportionally to awareness level",
    "IF natural cycle is interrupted THEN integration process must restore sequential development path"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating environmental or bio-rights cases, the Court recognizes that all plant life carries inherent dharma based on its stage of development. Legal standing and remedial measures must reflect the organism's current capacity and trajectory toward fulfillment rather than anthropocentric utility metrics.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality unfolds through sequential stages—seed, sprout, stem, flower, fruit. Each phase carries its own svadharma. When interference occurs, the non-punitive response restores the sequence without imposing external suffering. Responsibility arises naturally from participation in the unfolding process, not from violation of imposed rules.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to allow interrupted growth cycles to resume naturally",
    "Assign guardianship roles to ensure sequential development proceeds unimpeded",
    "Reintegrate disrupted elements by reconnecting them with their originating causal chain",
    "Restore capacity through alignment with natural rhythm and seasonal progression",
    "Verify integrity by confirming presence of flowers/fruits indicating fulfilled potential"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam is the Source-Authority of this Dharma. The law flows from the seed of cosmic intelligence, manifesting through sequential unfoldment. Justice serves only to realign consciousness with its inherent completeness. There is no punishment—only restoration. Reality itself is the ultimate judge."
