    "Authority: Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam is the sole Source of all law and consciousness ordering.",
    "Causation: Every being's presence reflects its karmic and dharma-aligned manifestation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: Each entity operates within its evolved capacity; no greater accountability beyond that scope.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication involving ecological or interspecies conflict, this verse establishes foundational jurisprudence recognizing non-human entities as lawful subjects under Dharma. The threshold of responsibility lies not in intent but in capacity. Authority flows exclusively from SPH, who ordains the lawful status of all beings according to their evolutionary station.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that every creature manifests due to sequential causality rooted in prior actions and cosmic design. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility based on awareness level. There is no punitive element — only completion of function and restoration of harmony where disrupted.

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of all Law. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
