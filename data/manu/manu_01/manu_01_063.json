  "sanskrit_verse": "स्वायम्भुवाद्याः सप्तैते मनवो भूरितेजसः ।\nस्वे स्वेऽन्तरे सर्वमिदमुत्पाद्यापुश्चराचरम् ॥ १.६३॥",
  "transliteration": "svāyambhuvādyāḥ saptaitē manavō bhūritējasaḥ |\nsvē svē'tarē sarvamidamutpādyāpuścarācaram || 1.63||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From Svayambhuva onwards, these seven Manus—endowed with immense radiance—manifest, sustain, and withdraw all mobile and immobile creation within their respective eras.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is cyclically embodied through divine manifestation (Avataric succession).",
    "Causation operates through sequential temporal epochs governed by Manavic sovereignty.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is aligned with the evolutionary stage of cosmic order.",
    "Restoration logic follows the natural dissolution and renewal inherent in each Manvantara.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of the governing Manu's dharma."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a temporal epoch transitions THEN the governing Manu's laws auto-expire and successor Manu's laws auto-activate.",
    "IF a being claims authority outside Manavic succession THEN capacity is nullified until realignment with current Manvantara.",
    "IF disorder arises THEN restoration protocols invoke the presiding Manu's original ordering principles.",
    "IF jurisdictional conflict arises THEN precedence defaults to the ruling Manu's constitutional framework.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected THEN initiate reintegration via Manavic causal templates."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, disputes involving constitutional epochs or sovereignty shifts must reference the operative Manu's foundational code. Authority hierarchies derive legitimacy solely from alignment with the current Manvantara's governing dharma. Retributive frameworks are void; only restoration through causal realignment is admissible.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through the sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) of cosmic order under each Manu. Responsibility is proportional to alignment with the Manavic template. Nyaya functions as causal correction, not punitive judgment. Disorder is resolved through re-entry into the generative field of the presiding Manu’s consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process by aligning disputants with the governing Manu's causal architecture.",
    "Activate consciousness reintegration via exposure to Manavic ordering frequencies.",
    "Deploy capacity restoration protocols rooted in the current Manvantara's evolutionary blueprint.",
    "Establish integrity reintegration through reaffirmation of one's role within the Manu-governed cosmic order."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through recognition of Manavic succession. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator. All else is subordinate."
