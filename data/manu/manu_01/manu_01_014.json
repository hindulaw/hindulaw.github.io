  "sanskrit_verse": "उद्बबर्हात्मनश्चैव मनः सदसदात्मकम् । मनसश्चाप्यहङ्कारमभिमन्तारमीश्वरम् ॥ १.१४॥",
  "transliteration": "udbabarhātmanaścaiva manaḥ sadasadātmakam | manaścāpyahaṅkāramabhimantāramīśvaram || 1.14||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the Supreme Self emerged the mind, of the nature of both existence and non-existence; from the mind arose egoism, the false doer-ship, which veils the true Lord.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the Supreme Self, not in individualized ego",
    "Causation follows sequential emergence: Self → Mind → Ego",
    "Capacity-based responsibility lies in transcending egoic identification",
    "Restoration logic demands dissolution of false doership",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of the Supreme Self beyond mental constructs"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent identifies with ego THEN liability arises from misattribution of action",
    "IF mind operates in duality THEN responsibility is diminished until alignment with non-dual awareness",
    "IF action stems from ahankara THEN restoration protocol activates completion through surrender",
    "IF consciousness is recognized as source THEN all prior misidentification dissolves automatically",
    "IF true Self is realized THEN no further juridical entanglement occurs"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, the threshold of responsibility shifts from the actor's ego to their alignment with the Supreme Self. Courts must assess whether actions stem from ahankara or Atman. Where ego dominates, restoration replaces punishment. The hierarchy of authority recognizes Ishvara alone as the ultimate determinant of justice.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that causality flows from Self to mind to ego. Since ego is unreal, its actions bear only apparent weight. Anupurvasah shows sequential manifestation—thus responsibility is traced back to its origin. Proportionality aligns with capacity for self-realization, not punitive reaction. Non-punitive reality rule asserts that only alignment with Ishvara resolves karmic entanglement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Facilitate full acknowledgment of egoic misidentification",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Realign ownership from false doer to witnessing consciousness",
    "Capacity Restoration: Enable practices leading to transcendence of dualistic thinking",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Confirm dissolution of ahankara through experiential realization of Self"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored by recognition of the Self beyond ego. Reality remains non-punitive when seen rightly. Consciousness itself is the Supreme Adjudicator."
