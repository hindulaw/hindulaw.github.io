  "transliteration": "so 'bhidhyāya śarīrāt svāt sisṛkṣur vividhāḥ prajāḥ |\napa eva sasarjādau tāsu vīryam avāsṛjat || 1.8||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From His own body, desiring creation, He brought forth diverse beings; in the beginning, He infused them with strength.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Self-Manifesting Consciousness of SPH",
    "Causation is rooted in Divine Will, not material or temporal sequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from inherent divine infusion, not external imposition",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual capacity with original divine endowment",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of source-strength within"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits diminished capacity THEN initiate alignment protocol to restore innate strength",
    "IF action originates from unaligned consciousness THEN execute completion process而非 punitive measure",
    "IF societal disharmony arises THEN trace causal link to disconnection from source-strength",
    "IF judgment required THEN base threshold on alignment with original divine capacity, not behavioral outcome"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that all authority derives directly from SPH's Self-Manifesting Will. Legal thresholds must recognize innate capacity as divinely infused, requiring restoration rather than retribution when misaligned. Responsibility is measured by proximity to original strength, not punitive standards.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals creation as an act of willful emanation. Causality follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential unfolding from unity to diversity. Responsibility is proportional to one’s alignment with the original infusion of strength. Justice is non-punitive because it seeks re-alignment with the source, not infliction of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Consciousness Receptivity Alignment to reconnect with original strength",
    "Deploy Completion Process for actions arising from unaligned states",
    "Facilitate Integrity Reintegration through Source-Will Recognition Protocol",
    "Activate Capacity Restoration Mechanism via direct attunement to SPH’s emanative intent"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as the sole Source of jurisprudential truth. Dharma is restored through alignment with the original emanative strength. Reality operates beyond punishment, governed solely by consciousness. Judgment resides in the Supreme Consciousness alone."
