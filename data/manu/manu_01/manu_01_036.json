  "sph_interpretive_translation": "These seven Manus, born of infinite radiance, created the worlds, the gods, the classes of divine beings, and the great sages of unmeasured power.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness illumination, not institutional mandate",
    "Causation is sequential and emanates from the primordial will of the Supreme Consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises inherently through conscious participation in creation",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual action with cosmic order through recognition of source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures harmony between thought, word, deed, and universal law"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity manifests creative capacity THEN entity bears inherent duty to sustain created order",
    "IF deviation occurs THEN realign through reconnection to source-consciousness",
    "IF authority claimed THEN validate through demonstrable alignment with dharma-tattva",
    "IF conflict arises THEN resolve by invoking pramāṇa-based causal sequence",
    "IF completion required THEN enforce via consciousness-integrity protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that judicial authority derives from alignment with the Supreme Consciousness, not mere appointment. Responsibility thresholds are determined by one's capacity to uphold dharma, and disputes are resolved through tracing back to the original causal intent rather than imposing punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that all creation flows sequentially from the will of the Supreme. Thus, any misalignment is addressed through retracing the causal chain to restore integrity. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of conscious participation in the act. Justice, therefore, functions as a restorative mechanism ensuring continuity with the originating consciousness, never as retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness-realignment process through guided śravaṇa and smaraṇa of origin-truth",
    "Assign completion practices to restore energetic congruence with foundational dharma",
    "Facilitate reintegration through acknowledgment of source-consciousness as singular adjudicator",
    "Enforce responsibility assumption through svādhyāya and yajña-based corrective action",
    "Deploy dharmic resonance techniques to dissolve karmic friction without inflicting suffering"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through recognition of the Supreme Consciousness as sole source, executor, and judge. Reality remains non-punitive; consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
