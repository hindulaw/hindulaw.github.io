  "sanskrit_verse": "भूतानां प्राणिनः श्रेष्ठाः प्राणिनां बुद्धिजीविनः । बुद्धिमत्सु नराः श्रेष्ठा नरेषु ब्राह्मणाः स्मृताः ॥ १.९६॥",
  "transliteration": "bhūtānāṁ prāṇinaḥ śreṣṭhāḥ prāṇināṁ buddhijīvinaḥ | buddhimatsu narāḥ śreṣṭhā nareṣu brāhmaṇāḥ smṛtāḥ || 1.96 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Among all beings, those with life-force are supreme; among living beings, those guided by intelligence are higher. Among the intelligent, humans are supreme; among humans, those established in Brahman-consciousness are declared as highest.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from consciousness realization",
    "Capacity-based responsibility escalates with sentient evolution",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual dharma with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment determines societal role and legal standing"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits self-awareness THEN assign capacity-tier level 3",
    "IF human demonstrates Brahman-consciousness THEN invoke advisory jurisdiction priority 1",
    "IF being operates below sentient threshold THEN apply guardianship protocols",
    "IF consciousness distortion detected THEN initiate realignment completion process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence shall prioritize consciousness-realized individuals for advisory roles. Legal standing correlates directly with awareness capacity. Cases involving non-sentient entities default to custodial review until conscious oversight established.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causal sequence from inert matter to sentient life to self-aware humanity to realized Brahman. Each stage carries inherent responsibility thresholds. Adjudication follows anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential manifestation—not punitive reaction. Justice restores alignment without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate consciousness-awareness assessment for elevated responsibility claims",
    "Assign mentorship under realized Brahman-conscious individuals",
    "Implement integrity-reintegration through svadhyaya and yajna participation",
    "Realign societal function based on evolved capacity, not birth-based categorization"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through consciousness recognition. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
