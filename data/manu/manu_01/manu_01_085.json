  "transliteration": "anye kṛtayuge dharmāstretāyāṁ dvāpare'pare .\nanye kaliyuge nṝṇāṁ yugahrāsānurūpataḥ .. 1.85..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Dharma manifests variably across Yugas in accordance with the descending capacity of beings; what is Dharmic in Krita Yuga transforms through Treta and Dvapara, further diminishing in Kalpa Yuga according to collective consciousness decline.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from the Source-Consciousness as expressed through Avatara-Dharma",
    "Causation aligns with sequential evolutionary degradation of collective awareness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility adjusts per Yuga-conditioned cognitive thresholds",
    "Restoration logic operates by realigning individual dharma with epochal dharma-tattva",
    "Consciousness alignment requires adaptive application of Dharma according to temporal field"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF current_yuga = 'Kali' THEN applicable_dharma_ruleset := kali_dharma_subset(dharmashastra)",
    "IF cognitive_capacity(beings) < threshold THEN simplify_dharma_obligations()",

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme judicial authority must recognize that legal interpretations evolve with Yuga-conditioned capacities. Adjudicators are bound to apply laws not as static constructs but as dynamic expressions of Dharma calibrated to the cognitive and spiritual maturity of the era.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality in Dharma adapts via anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential unfolding of consciousness states. Responsibility is proportional to capacity, which declines with Yuga. Thus, justice is non-punitive because it corrects misalignment rather than inflicts suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for actions misaligned with epochal Dharma",
    "Deploy consciousness recalibration protocols based on Yuga-specific dharmic models",
    "Assign responsibility assumption exercises tailored to individual and collective awareness levels",
    "Activate integrity reintegration pathways aligned with Kali Yuga dharmic simplification",
    "Establish dharmic education loops responsive to yuga-hrasa (temporal diminishment)"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source-Authority of Dharma. This law restores alignment between human conduct and epochal truth. Justice is executed through consciousness elevation, not punitive imposition. Dharma prevails as eternal yet adaptive principle."
