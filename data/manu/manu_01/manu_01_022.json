  "sanskrit_verse": "कर्मात्मनां च देवानां सोऽसृजत्प्राणिनां प्रभुः ।\nसाध्यानां च गणं सूक्ष्मं यज्ञं चैव सनातनम् ॥ १.२२॥",
  "transliteration": "karmātmānāṃ ca devānāṃ so'sṛjat prāṇināṃ prabhuḥ |\nsādhyānāṃ ca gaṇaṃ sūkṣmaṃ yajñaṃ caiva sanātanam || 1.22||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Supreme Lord, Master of all beings, generated the divine entities who are embodiments of action, along with the subtle group of perfected beings known as the Sādhyas, and established the eternal sacrifice as the foundational order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Supreme Consciousness as the sole Source of cosmic law",
    "Causation is sequentially manifested through divine will, not material determinism",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from alignment with one's innate dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to the eternal sacrificial order",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures harmonious participation in the universal law"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity performs action → THEN action must align with its svadharma as defined by Supreme Consciousness",
    "IF deviation occurs → THEN realign through participation in sustaining rituals or dharmic structures",
    "IF capacity is diminished → THEN restore through conscious reintegration protocols",
    "IF causality is disputed → THEN trace back to source consciousness; not material antecedents"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing that all agency stems from divine will. Legal hierarchy must reflect cosmic order where individual acts derive meaning only within the eternal framework of yajña. Adjudicators must assess alignment with svadharma rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality originates in consciousness, not in isolated events. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential unfolding from the Supreme Will. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and alignment, never punitive. Justice restores connection to the eternal sacrificial flow without inflicting suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svādhyāya-Yajña to realign individual consciousness with cosmic rhythm",
    "Assign completion process through service aligned with one's natural capacity",
    "Reintegrate through community-sanctioned ritual reaffirming dharmic identity",
    "Restore capacity via guru-guided purification and conscious remembrance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as the singular Source of Dharma. The universe functions under an eternal sacrificial order wherein justice serves restoration alone. There is no punishment—only realignment of consciousness toward its highest truth. Thus is Dharma executed."
