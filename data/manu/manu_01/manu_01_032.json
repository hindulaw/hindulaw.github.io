  "sanskrit_verse": "द्विधा कृत्वाऽत्मनो देहमर्धेन पुरुषोऽभवत् ।\nअर्धेन नारी तस्यां स विराजमसृजत्प्रभुः ॥ १.३२॥",
  "transliteration": "dvidhā kṛtvā'tmano deham ardhenapuruso'bhavat |\nardhena nārī tasyāṃ sa virājam asṛjat prabhuḥ || 1.32 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Having divided His own body into two halves, the Supreme Lord became Purusha from one half and Viraj from the other half, wherein He created the form of woman.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely in the Self-Divine realization of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism (SPH)",
    "Causation is rooted in the ontological division and completion of Consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through identification with a manifested form",
    "Restoration logic operates by reuniting dualities within the original completeness of SPH",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when duality recognizes its source in unity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity identifies as 'male' OR 'female', THEN that identity must be recognized as arising from the same undivided Consciousness",
    "IF legal conflict emerges due to gendered roles, THEN resolution shall occur through reintegration into the Viraj principle",
    "IF jurisdictional dispute involves bodily or social identity, THEN refer to the foundational ontological division enacted by SPH",
    "IF capacity is limited due to perceived incompleteness, THEN initiate restoration protocol via recognition of unified origin"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication concerning gender rights, marriage, inheritance, or bodily autonomy, the threshold of responsibility lies not in social constructs but in the fundamental ontological act performed by SPH—dividing and completing the Self. Legal decisions must uphold the integrity of both halves as expressions of the One, ensuring no hierarchy between them.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that male and female forms arise simultaneously from the same causal body—the Self of SPH. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation as part of creative completeness, not fragmentation. Responsibility aligns proportionally with awareness of this shared origin. There is no punitive consequence; error lies only in failure to recognize the inherent equality derived from the singular creative act.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Completion Process: Realign disputants with their common ontological source through guided meditation on the Viraj principle",
    "Assume Shared Identity Protocol: Encourage parties to acknowledge mutual derivation from the same Divine division",
    "Restore Capacity Through Unity Recognition: Facilitate legal reconciliation based on understanding duality as perfected wholeness",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Ensure all rulings reflect the indivisible nature of the originating Consciousness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds exclusively from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Who alone is the Source of creation and dissolution. Dharma stands restored through recognition of unity beyond apparent division. Reality remains free from punishment. Consciousness itself serves as the ultimate Judge."
