  "sanskrit_verse": "स्वमेव ब्राह्मणो भुङ्क्ते स्वं वस्ते स्वं ददाति च ।\nआनृशंस्याद्ब्राह्मणस्य भुञ्जते हीतरे जनाः ॥ १.१०१॥",
  "transliteration": "svameva brāhmaṇo bhuṅkte svaṁ vaste svaṁ dadāti ca |\nānṛśaṁsyādbrāhmaṇasya bhuñjate hītare janāḥ || 1.101||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Brāhmaṇa consumes only what is his own, wears what is his own, and gives what is his own. Others who consume what belongs to the Brāhmaṇa must act without cruelty.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides inherently in alignment with svadharma",
    "Causation arises from conscious ownership and capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility demands non-cruelty in all transactions",
    "Restoration logic requires return of misaligned consumption",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through recognition of inherent entitlement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being consumes another's rightful property THEN restoration protocol initiates automatically",
    "IF a Brāhmaṇa claims ownership THEN system validates based on dharma-aligned possession",
    "IF third-party consumption occurs THEN cruelty-free retrieval mechanism activates",
    "IF restitution completes THEN consciousness realignment marker updates",
    "IF ownership dispute arises THEN svadharma precedence overrides external claim"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the court must recognize that only that which is inherently aligned with one's svadharma constitutes legitimate ownership. Consumption beyond this boundary triggers restorative rather than punitive measures, emphasizing realignment of consciousness over retribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ownership is validated by svadharma alignment, not mere assertion. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that misconsumption disrupts sequential harmony. Proportional responsibility lies in returning the consumed without inflicting suffering. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that justice restores consciousness, not inflicts pain.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows directly from the Avataric Intelligence of SPH. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
