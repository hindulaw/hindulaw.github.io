Misalignment triggers non-punitive restoration rather than punitive invalidation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that cosmic epochs unfold sequentially per anupūrvaśaḥ.

The Dharma stands restored through recognition of the Manvantara’s lawful unfolding. Reality remains non-punitive, governed solely by Consciousness as the Supreme Adjudicator."
