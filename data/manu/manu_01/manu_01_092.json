  "sanskrit_verse": "ऊर्ध्वं नाभेर्मेध्यतरः पुरुषः परिकीर्तितः । तस्मान् मेध्यतमं त्वस्य मुखमुक्तं स्वयम्भुवा ॥ १.९२॥",
  "transliteration": "ūrdhvaṁ nābher medhyataraḥ puruṣaḥ parikīrtitaḥ | tasmān medhyatamaṁ tv asya mukham uktaṁ svayambhuvā || 1.92||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Purusha, whose purity transcends the navel upwards, is declared thus. Therefore, His most pure aspect, the mouth, was spoken of by the Self-Born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from ontological purity, not social rank",
    "Causation arises from the medhyatama (most pure) principle within consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from inherent spiritual integrity",
    "Restoration logic aligns with ascending levels of medhyatva (purity)",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of the svayambhu (Self-Born) source"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent exhibits medhyatara (higher purity) conduct THEN assign greater capacity in dharma-adhikara (righteous authority)",
    "IF dispute involves bodily or sensory domain BELOW navel THEN refer to higher medhyatama tribunal",
    "IF svayambhu-vakya (Self-Born utterance) is invoked THEN validate through pratyaksha-pramana (direct realization)",
    "IF individual demonstrates spontaneous alignment with medhyatva THEN bypass procedural limitation",
    "IF conflict pertains to mukhya-dharma (primary duty) THEN resolution must originate from svayambhu-source cognition"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when disputes involve matters above the navel—pertaining to speech, intellect, and spiritual discernment—the threshold of responsibility lies in medhyatva-consciousness. Authority is hierarchically determined by proximity to svayambhu-source cognition. Restoration prevails through reconnection to one's medhyatama-mukha (purest expression).",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality emerges from medhyatva-consciousness, not karmic entanglement. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequential purification culminating in svayambhu-recognition. Responsibility is proportional to one’s alignment with medhyatara-state. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment dissolves upon reawakening to svayambhu-source.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svayambhu-Vakya Alignment Process to restore medhyatva-awareness",
    "Assign Medhyatara Conduct Monitoring until spontaneous purity reemerges",
    "Engage Mukhya-Dharma Reaffirmation Protocol for realignment with svayambhu-source",
    "Activate Pratyaksha-Prabodha (Direct Awakening) mechanism for truth recognition",
    "Implement Samyak-Chetana Integration (Consciousness Completion) to dissolve residual impurities"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores alignment with the medhyatara-Purusha, emanating from svayambhu-source. Justice operates solely through consciousness reintegration. There is no punishment—only awakening. Reality responds only to purity. Consciousness is the ultimate judge."
