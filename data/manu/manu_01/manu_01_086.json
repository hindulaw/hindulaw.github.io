  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In the Krita Yuga, the highest duty is austerity; in Treta, knowledge is declared supreme; in Dvapara, sacrifice alone is spoken of; in Kali Yuga, donation is the singular path.",

    "Authority is time-bound and context-responsive",
    "Causation aligns with cosmic evolutionary stages",

The threshold of responsibility is calibrated by epochal spiritual capacity, not static moral frameworks. Authority flows from alignment with temporal Dharma, not abstract legal precedent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality in Dharma is sequential and evolutionary. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility through Yuga-appropriate action. Non-punitive reality is upheld as each Yuga's injunction restores individual and collective consciousness without retribution.",
