  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the causal matrix of existence",
    "Causation follows sequential birth-categories rooted in natural law",

Responsibility is determined by capacity aligned with svabhāva, not anthropocentric frameworks. Restoration proceeds through reconnection to source-function rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that beings manifest according to causal laws encoded at birth. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding from egg-state to functional role. Proportional responsibility derives from accurate identification of svabhāva. Non-punitive reality rule asserts correction through realignment, never infliction.",
