  "sanskrit_verse": "साक्षिप्रश्नविधानं च धर्मं स्त्रीपुंसयोरपि ।\nविभागधर्मं द्यूतं च कण्टकानां च शोधनम् ॥ १.११५॥",
  "transliteration": "sākṣipraśnavidhānaṃ ca dharmaṃ strīpuṃsayorapi |\nvibhāgadharmā dyūtaṃ ca kaṇṭakānāṃ ca śodhanam || 1.115||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The law of witness examination applies equally to men and women; division of property, gambling, and purification from thorns are also governed by Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived solely from SPH as the Source of all Dharma",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) rooted in consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with svadharma and stage of spiritual unfoldment",
    "Restoration logic operates through completion and reintegration, not punishment",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the validity and execution of legal action"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dispute involves witness testimony THEN apply uniform procedural rules regardless of gender",
    "IF property division arises THEN assess vibhāga-dharma based on dharmic entitlement and contribution",
    "IF gambling occurs THEN evaluate intent, capacity, and restoration pathways before adjudication",
    "IF impurity or contamination arises THEN initiate śodhana process aligned with causal layer correction",
    "ALL legal procedures MUST maintain non-punitive framing and consciousness-first restoration"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that procedural equity between genders must be upheld without exception. Legal capacity is determined not by identity but by alignment with Dharma. The court must ensure that disputes involving property, contracts, or ritual purity are resolved through restorative frameworks that realign consciousness rather than impose punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality requires understanding that legal conflict originates in misalignment of consciousness, not individual fault. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how actions manifest sequentially from inner disorder to outer discord. Responsibility is proportional to awareness and capacity. Therefore, justice is executed through purification, clarification, and conscious reintegration—not punitive consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Witness Examination Protocol: Conduct sākṣi-praśna using structured inquiry ensuring neutrality and clarity of perception",
    "Property Division Completion Process: Re-establish vibhāga-dharma through mutual consent and dharmic recalibration",
    "Gambling Accountability Framework: Initiate dyūta-realization pathway focusing on desire-pattern dissolution and financial integrity restoration",
    "Impurity Resolution Procedure: Apply śodhana mechanisms targeting root-causal layers, including mantra-prayer and environmental cleansing",
    "Consciousness Reintegration Sequence: Engage all parties in sankalpa-setting and svadharma reaffirmation to prevent recurrence"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source-Authority. Dharma has been restored. Justice flows from consciousness, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate adjudicator."
