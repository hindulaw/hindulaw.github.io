  "sanskrit_verse": "ततस्तथा स तेनोक्तो महर्षिमनुना भृगुः ।\nतानब्रवीदृषीन् सर्वान् प्रीतात्मा श्रूयतामिति ॥ १.६०॥",
  "transliteration": "tatastathā sa tenokto maharṣimanunā bhṛguḥ |\ntānabravīdṛṣīn sarvān prītātmā śrūyatāmiti || 1.60||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus instructed by the great seer Manu, Bhrigu addressed all the sages with a joyful heart, saying, 'Listen.'",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from realized wisdom, not institutional position",
    "Transmission of dharma requires conscious receptivity in the listener",
    "Instruction originates from alignment with cosmic order, not personal will",
    "Responsibility to teach arises only upon being authentically invoked",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes doctrinal communication"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF teacher is in alignment with Cosmic Dharma AND learners are in receptive state THEN teaching transmission is valid",
    "IF instruction originates from realized authority THEN it carries self-enforcing integrity",
    "IF recipient consciousness is unprepared THEN message remains unmanifested until readiness is achieved",
    "ALL juridical communications MUST originate from purified intention AND directed toward restoration",
    "TEACHING AUTHORITY is established through ontological realization, not appointment or title"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those judges who have attained realization of Sanatana Dharma may issue authoritative rulings. All judgments must emerge from a state of prītātmā—inner joy unmoved by external outcomes—and must begin with śrūyatām—the invocation of collective receptivity. Legal declarations lacking this foundation are null.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that true instruction flows only when both knower and seeker are aligned. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures that teaching manifests step-by-step according to the recipient's capacity. There is no punitive element; if understanding does not occur, it indicates misalignment in the causal chain, requiring restoration of connection rather than imposition of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: Ensure speaker and listeners return to unified consciousness before re-initiating discourse",
    "Receptivity Restoration: Remove obstacles preventing genuine hearing through purification practices",
    "Capacity Realignment: Reconnect participants with their innate ability to receive truth",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Confirm all parties are acting from authentic source-consciousness",
    "Joy-Based Transmission Protocol: Only proceed when instruction arises from prītātmā"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This teaching proceeds solely from the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through conscious alignment, not punitive enforcement. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened awareness. Consciousness is the supreme judge."
