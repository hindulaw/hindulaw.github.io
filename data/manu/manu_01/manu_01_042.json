  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That action which has been declared here for beings according to their nature—I shall now declare unto you likewise, along with its sequential unfolding in birth.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the Source-Knower who declares Dharma",
    "Causation follows sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with inherent nature",
    "Restoration logic operates through understanding karmic sequence",
    "Consciousness alignment arises from comprehending causal order"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being's action is known according to its nature THEN declare that same law universally",
    "IF sequential cause-effect is established THEN assign capacity-aware responsibility accordingly",
    "IF consciousness misalignment occurs THEN initiate restoration via knowledge reintegration",
    "IF birth-conditioned causality is present THEN apply corresponding dharma-law without punitive intent"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes the threshold of responsibility based on inherent nature rather than imposed moral frameworks. Authority derives solely from the Source-Knower who discerns and declares true causality. The court must recognize actions within their sequential unfolding and not impose external punitive structures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that actions arise from inherent nature and unfold sequentially. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures proportional responsibility aligned with consciousness-state at time of act. There is no punitive element; only recognition and realignment toward original knowing.",

    "Initiate completion process by revealing full karmic sequence",
    "Reintegrate individual consciousness with source-awareness of action",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned knowing. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the supreme adjudicator."
