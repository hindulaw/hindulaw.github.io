  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The classification of diverse plant forms—including clustered bushes, varied shrubs, grass species, seed-bearing stems, creeping vines, and climbers—is established by their inherent structural and functional dharmic design.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority as natural order",
    "Causation through svabhava (inherent nature)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligned with varna-dharma",
    "Restoration logic rooted in ecological harmony",
    "Consciousness alignment via recognition of interdependent life forms"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a botanical entity exhibits a structured growth pattern THEN it shall be categorized according to its morphological dharma.",
    "IF a flora type demonstrates reproductive autonomy THEN it bears responsibility for sustaining its lineage without external coercion.",
    "IF a plant interacts within an ecosystem THEN its preservation is mandated under the principle of collective biospheric integrity.",
    "IF human action disrupts botanical svadharma THEN corrective measures must restore ecological balance without punitive intent."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating environmental disputes involving vegetation, the Supreme Court must recognize each plant form's intrinsic dharma. Legal thresholds of responsibility are determined by the degree of conscious interaction between humans and flora, prioritizing restoration over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality confirms that each plant manifests according to its svabhava; thus, disturbance arises only when external forces violate this natural sequence (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility lies not in punishment but in aligning interventions with ecological completion. Proportionality is measured through disruption impact, not retributive equivalence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate bio-regeneration cycles where disrupted ecosystems undergo phased restoration guided by native species' svadharma.",
    "Establish dharmic land-use protocols ensuring no artificial interference overrides natural botanical progression.",
    "Deploy consciousness-based monitoring systems to assess ecological health and trigger automatic remedial responses.",
    "Enforce completion processes wherein responsible parties engage directly in restoring affected botanical environments until equilibrium is achieved."

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this ruling originates. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates all existence."
