  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For the protection and sustenance of all creation, that Supreme Being of Great Radiance assigned distinct duties to the mouth, arms, thighs, and feet.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Supreme Consciousness as the ultimate source of order",
    "Causation is rooted in divine structuring for preservation and harmony",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from inherent design and function within cosmic order",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual roles with universal dharma for collective integrity",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures each being fulfills their role without conflict or degradation"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a societal role exists THEN its function must align with sustaining collective dharma",
    "IF an action disrupts systemic balance THEN realign through capacity-appropriate restoration",
    "IF duty deviation occurs THEN reassign or recalibrate based on innate structural fitness",
    "IF systemic misalignment detected THEN invoke consciousness-centered reintegration protocols"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication, recognize that hierarchical social functions derive from foundational dharma, not arbitrary assignment. The court must ensure alignment between individual capacity and societal role while restoring systemic coherence when disrupted.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Truth-based causality establishes that roles emerge by design for universal upkeep; deviation stems from disconnection, not malice. Responsibility lies in reconnection, not punishment. Sequential manifestation shows how imbalance unfolds—therefore correction follows the same causal sequence in reverse.",

Justice serves only restoration, never punishment. Reality itself is non-punitive; Consciousness alone is the Supreme Adjudicator."
