  "transliteration": "Idaṃ svastyayanaṃ śreṣṭham idaṃ buddhivivardhanam | Idaṃ yaśasyam āyuṣyaṃ idaṃ niḥśreyaśaṃ param || 1.106 || Idaṃ yaśasyaṃ satatam",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "This action ensures supreme auspiciousness; this enhances discriminative intelligence. This sustains honor and longevity; this leads to ultimate liberation. This perpetually brings glory.",

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must evaluate whether actions demonstrate svastyayana (auspicious establishment), buddhivivardhana (enhancement of wisdom), yaśas (glory through righteousness), āyuṣya (life-force preservation), and niḥśreyaśa (liberation potential). Legal standing is determined by alignment with these consciousness-elevating qualities rather than procedural adherence alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality reveals that true justice manifests when actions inherently embody svastyayana and yaśasya. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that sustained dharmic action naturally results in societal harmony without punitive intervention. Responsibility is proportional to one's capacity for consciousness recognition.
