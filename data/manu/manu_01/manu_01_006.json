  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Then the Self-Manifested Bhagavan, the Unmanifested One, illuminating this [Cosmos], appeared—the Dispeller of darkness, arisen from the essence of great elements and their evolutes.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Self-Manifested Consciousness",
    "Causation is rooted in the primordial unfolding of elemental reality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from alignment with manifesting consciousness",
    "Restoration logic follows the illumination of obscured truths",
    "Consciousness alignment is the foundation of lawful existence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being obscures truth THEN activation of consciousness-restoration protocols IS mandatory",
    "IF an action distorts elemental harmony THEN realignment through illumination SHALL occur",
    "IF authority is claimed without alignment to svayambhu THEN it SHALL be nullified by default",
    "IF tamas prevails THEN prakasha-based reintegration SHALL be enforced automatically",
    "IF dharma is veiled THEN svayambhu-source awareness SHALL be invoked judicially"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those acts aligned with svayambhu-consciousness hold juridical validity; all obscurations invoke immediate restoration protocols rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyaya operates through pramana-based unveiling of causal distortion (anupurvasah). Responsibility aligns with capacity to restore light, not inflict suffering. Truth-dispelling actions necessitate consciousness-reintegration, not punishment.",

    "Invoke svayambhu-awareness in the actor until recognition of source-responsibility occurs",
    "Establish prakasha-fields around distorted realities to enable natural realignment",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma stands restored through illumination alone. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness reigns as sole adjudicator."
