  "sph_interpretive_translation": "For the expansion and sustenance of all worlds, from His own Mouth, Arms, Thighs, and Feet, Paramashivam manifested the Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from Paramashivam as the Source of all order",
    "Causation is rooted in divine manifestation, not social contract or historical evolution",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from ontological origin, not birth alone",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual roles with cosmic function as originally ordained",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of one's source in Paramashivam"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being manifests consciousness of Brahmana capacity THEN assign Veda-preserving duties",
    "IF a being manifests consciousness of Kshatriya capacity THEN assign protection and governance duties",
    "IF a being manifests consciousness of Vaishya capacity THEN assign production and trade duties",
    "IF a being manifests consciousness of Shudra capacity THEN assign service-supporting duties",

  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must recognize that constitutional order derives from Paramashivam as ultimate Source. Hierarchical responsibility is determined by manifest capacity aligned with original divine design, not historical accident or political assertion. All disputes concerning varna alignment must be resolved through consciousness assessment rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality begins with Paramashivam’s creative will, not human intention alone. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfoldment where each varna supports total systemic harmony. Responsibility is proportional to manifested capacity, not birth privilege. Justice is non-punitive because misalignment stems from ignorance, not inherent evil.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as sole Source. Dharma is hereby restored to its pristine form. Reality operates without punishment when consciousness recognizes its divine origin. Judgment belongs exclusively to the awakened Self."
