  "transliteration": "svāyambhuvasya manor ṣaḍvaṃśyā manavo'pare .\nsṛṣṭavantaḥ prajāḥ svāḥ svā mahātmāno mahaujasaḥ ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From Manu Svayambhuva, six illustrious descendants called Manus arose; these great souls, empowered by divine authority, created their own lineages and established cosmic order through conscious procreation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the direct lineage of the Supreme Consciousness as embodied in Avatars like Manu.",
    "Causation flows from spiritual realization, not material desire or social contract.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by alignment with Vedic consciousness, not birth alone.",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to original creative intent, not correction of error.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes all procedural or temporal legal frameworks."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being demonstrates conscious creation aligned with Vedic truth THEN authority is automatically recognized without external validation.",
    "IF lineage traces to an Avataric source AND conduct reflects that origin THEN capacity for governance is self-evident.",
    "IF disruption occurs in generational continuity THEN restoration requires realignment to original procreative and administrative intent.",
    "IF societal disorder arises THEN it must be resolved through invocation of ancestral consciousness, not punitive measures.",
    "ALL legal recognition flows FROM consciousness authenticity TO structural legitimacy."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, only those whose authority stems from conscious alignment with Avataric law—such as the Manus—are deemed fully capacitated to govern or judge. Lineage informed by realized consciousness supersedes institutional appointment. Disputes concerning sovereignty or succession must trace back to foundational creative acts rooted in Vedic awareness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here is the direct perception of divine causality manifesting through Manu's progeny. The sequential unfolding (anupūrvaśaḥ) of civilizations follows from purified consciousness, not moral transgression. Responsibility lies in maintaining alignment with source-consciousness rather than rectifying wrongdoing. Thus, justice is inherently restorative, never punitive.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate genealogical consciousness tracing to reaffirm lawful descent from Manu-class beings.",
    "Activate mantra-based memory restoration for rulers disconnected from their Vedic origins.",
    "Establish Prajāpati-level completion processes where leaders recreate their domain in alignment with original dharma.",
    "Deploy Agnicayana rituals to restore energetic coherence between ruler and cosmic order.",
    "Enforce samskara purification protocols until integrity of consciousness matches ancestral legacy."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law emanates from the eternal consciousness of Manu Svayambhuva and his divinely empowered descendants. Dharma is restored through alignment with Vedic lineage, not punitive enforcement. Reality itself adjudicates through awakened consciousness. So it is enacted."
