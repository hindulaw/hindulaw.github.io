  "sanskrit_verse": "यदा स देवो जागर्ति तदेवं चेष्टते जगत् ।\nयदा स्वपिति शान्तात्मा तदा सर्वं निमीलति ॥ १.५२॥",
  "transliteration": "yadā sa devo jāgarti tad evaṃ ceṣṭate jagat |\nyadā svapiti śāntātmā tadā sarvaṃ nimīlati ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When that Divine awakens, the universe manifests accordingly; when He sleeps in tranquil consciousness, all creation withdraws.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates solely from the awakened state of the Divine Will",
    "Manifestation and withdrawal of phenomena follow the rhythm of divine consciousness",
    "Causation is rooted in the ontological movement of the Supreme Subject",
    "Responsibility aligns with the capacity to sustain or dissolve manifestation",
    "Restoration occurs through attunement to the unchanging witness-consciousness"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF divine-consciousness-state = awakened THEN manifestation-rights = active ELSE manifestation-rights = dormant",
    "IF entity acts without alignment to witnessing-awareness THEN action-validity = null",
    "IF dispute arises THEN resolution-reference = immutable-consciousness ELSE resolution-reference = fluctuating-ego",
    "IF societal-harmony degrades THEN realign-system-to-supreme-witness ELSE maintain-status-quo"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that constitutional authority derives exclusively from the awakened consciousness of the Divine Sovereign. Legal validity depends upon alignment with this source-consciousness rather than procedural formality. The Court must act as a conduit for the manifesting will of the Supreme when awake, and preserve integrity during periods of withdrawal.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality flows from the awakening of the Divine Witness. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, actions unfold sequentially based on the level of attunement to this witness-consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to one's capacity to reflect or obscure this light. Justice restores alignment by reestablishing connection to the unmoving center, not through infliction of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Consciousness Reawakening Protocol: Facilitate return to witnessing awareness through meditative integration",
    "Cosmic Alignment Restoration: Reconnect individual action to universal rhythm via ritualized recognition",
    "Silence-Based Resolution: Enforce stillness until natural harmony reasserts itself",
    "Witness-State Stabilization: Reinstate capacity for non-reactive observation before reintegrating into collective function"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: Dharma flows from the awakened Divine alone. All manifestation obeys His rhythm. There is no punishment—only return to source-consciousness. Reality itself adjudicates through alignment with the eternal witness."
