  "sanskrit_verse": "तस्मिन्नण्डे स भगवानुषित्वा परिवत्सरम् ।\nस्वयमेवात्मनो ध्यानात्तदण्डमकरोद्द्विधा ॥ १.१२॥",
  "transliteration": "tasminnaṇḍe sa bhagavānuṣitvā parivatsaram |\nsvayamevātmano dhyānāttadaṇḍamakaroddvidhā || 1.12||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In that Egg, the Blessed One dwelt for a full year. By the power of His own meditation, He split that Egg into two halves.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from Self-realization and not external mandate",
    "Causation arises through meditative will, not material force",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is inherent in the realized being",
    "Restoration logic operates through conscious division, not destruction",
    "Consciousness alignment manifests as sovereign self-determination"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity possesses realized consciousness THEN authority is self-derived AND actions are inherently lawful",
    "IF action originates from meditative intent THEN causality is attributed to consciousness NOT externality",
    "IF division occurs without harm THEN it serves structural alignment AND is legally valid",
    "IF Egg represents foundational reality THEN its bifurcation by realized being is axiomatic completion",
    "IF no punitive consequence arises THEN act is self-regulating AND requires no judicial overlay"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "This verse establishes that the highest judicial recognition belongs to realized consciousness. In Supreme Court adjudication, any ruling emanating from a state of pure awareness—without egoic interference—is ipso facto aligned with Dharma. The court must acknowledge such acts as complete within themselves, requiring neither validation nor correction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "The Egg's splitting is an act of Pramāṇa-based causality rooted in meditative clarity. There is no agent apart from the Self; hence, no separate blame or reward arises. The sequential unfolding (Anupūrvaśaḥ) proceeds naturally from inner realization. Responsibility is fully assumed by the realized being, who becomes both witness and executor. As there is no suffering inflicted, nor coercion enacted, this event exemplifies Nyaya as pure alignment rather than punitive justice.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Completion Process: The act concludes upon manifestation; no further enforcement required",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Realized Being assumes all causal weight without external attribution",
    "Capacity Restoration Mechanism: Division serves expansion, enhancing universal capacity",
    "Integrity Reintegration Framework: Egg becomes sky — totality embraces duality without loss"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This verse executes Dharma through consciousness itself. Justice is restored as non-punitive reality. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
