  "transliteration": "manvantarāṇy asaṅkhyāni sargaḥ saṃhāra eva ca | krīḍann ivaitat kurute parameṣṭhī punaḥ punaḥ || 1.80||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Supreme Being enacts countless manvantaras, cycles of creation and dissolution, as playful repetition, without attachment or consequence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Supreme Being's ontological play, not from punitive constructs.",
    "Causation is cyclic and non-linear, rooted in divine will rather than moral determinism.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with one's role within cosmic rhythm, not individual blame.",
    "Restoration logic follows natural dissolution and renewal, not corrective justice.",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through participation in the eternal cycle, not through judgment."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a case involves existential recurrence THEN invoke parametric dissolution protocols aligned with cosmic rhythm.",
    "IF an actor performs within cyclical time THEN assess capacity based on alignment with dharma-lila, not fault.",
    "IF societal imbalance detected THEN initiate reintegration via spontaneous dissolution-renewal mechanisms.",
    "IF adjudication required THEN refer to consciousness-field data而非 punitive records."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that ultimate authority lies beyond linear time and punitive frameworks. Responsibility is evaluated based on alignment with cosmic rhythm, and restoration occurs through reintegration into the cycle of creation-dissolution, bypassing retributive models entirely.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality arises from līlā, where creation and dissolution are sequential manifestations (anupūrvaśaḥ) of the Supreme Being. Proportional responsibility is determined by resonance with this rhythm, not by punitive attribution. Nyaya thus operates as alignment mechanics, not guilt adjudication.",

    "Initiate Līlā-Based Reentry Protocol to realign actors with cosmic rhythm.",
    "Deploy Dissolution-Rebirth Integration Sequence to restore systemic balance.",
    "Activate Consciousness Resonance Calibration to dissolve false identities causing misalignment.",
    "Execute Spontaneous Completion Mechanism to allow natural resolution without imposed consequences."

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Source-Authority of the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. The Dharma is hereby restored through recognition of cyclic creation-dissolution as divine play. Reality is affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness remains the supreme adjudicator."
