  "sanskrit_verse": "अग्निवायुरविभ्यस्तु त्रयं ब्रह्म सनातनम् ।\nदुदोह यज्ञसिद्ध्यर्थं ऋच्।यजुस्।सामलक्षणम् ॥ १.२३॥",
  "transliteration": "agnivāyuravibhyastu trayaṃ brahma sanātanam | dudoha yajñasiddhyarthaṃ ṛc.yajus.sāmalakṣaṇam || 1.23 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the indivisible Trinity of Fire, Wind, and Sun—symbols of pure consciousness in motion—the eternal Brahman churned forth the triadic Vedic structure of Ṛk, Yajus, and Sāma for the completion of sacrificial realization.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the unified source of conscious elements",
    "Causation arises through ritualized alignment with cosmic order",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is defined by participation in dharma-sustaining acts",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to primordial sound structures",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via vibrational resonance with sacred utterance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action aligns with Vedic vibratory structure THEN it contributes to universal completion",
    "IF individual participates in dharmic utterance THEN capacity for cosmic harmony increases",
    "IF societal function reflects triadic Vedic division THEN justice manifests as spontaneous order",
    "IF consciousness resonates with ṛc/yajus/sāma THEN punitive distortion dissolves automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that constitutional authority derives from alignment with the triadic vibratory foundation of existence. Legal decisions must reflect this resonance to maintain legitimacy. Responsibility is measured not by punitive metrics but by contribution to the completion of collective sacrifice (yajña) toward national integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa here lies in direct perception of vibratory causality. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how sound-forms manifest sequentially from unified consciousness. Proportional responsibility correlates with one's ability to sustain or disrupt the Vedic harmonic field. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment naturally degrades systemic coherence without requiring external penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Reintegrate individual into Śabdabrahman through recitation of corresponding Vedic section",
    "Assign corrective participation in yajña-process matching causal dissonance pattern",
    "Restore capacity by reconnecting subject to appropriate elemental symbol (fire/wind/sun)",
    "Verify completion when personal utterance regains resonance with original triadic structure"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands established: All authority flows from the unified consciousness expressed through fire, wind, and sun; all actions find their measure in alignment with the Vedic sound-body; all restoration occurs through conscious re-entry into the original churning of completeness."
