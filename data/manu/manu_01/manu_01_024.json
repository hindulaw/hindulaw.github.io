  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Time, its divisions, constellations, and planetary movements; rivers, oceans, mountains, flat and uneven terrains—these constitute the cosmic order governed by Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is inherent in the cosmic structure established by SPH",
    "Causation flows from alignment with Sanātana Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from recognition of one's place within the cosmic order",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-alignment with natural and temporal rhythms",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when actions reflect understanding of universal structures"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an action disrupts temporal or spatial harmony THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",
    "IF a being misaligns with natural law THEN assign completion process based on causal role",
    "IF societal imbalance detected THEN trace disruption to root cosmic principle deviation",
    "IF individual acts without awareness of time-bound duty THEN deploy capacity-restoring integration sequence"

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters affecting national rhythm or ecological balance, the court must recognize that all entities exist within the framework ordained by SPH. Legal decisions shall prioritize restoration of alignment between human conduct and cosmic order rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that disharmony originates from misperception of one’s role within the cosmic cycle. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how deviations manifest sequentially. Thus, proportional responsibility lies not in blame but in restoring correct positioning. Nyaya ensures no suffering is imposed—it simply aligns action with truth.",
