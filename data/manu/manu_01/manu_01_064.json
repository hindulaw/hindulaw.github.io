  "sanskrit_verse": "निमेषा दश चाष्टौ च काष्ठा त्रिंशत्तु ताः कला ।\nत्रिंशत्कला मुहूर्तः स्यादहोरात्रं तु तावतः ॥ १.६४॥",
  "transliteration": "nimeṣā daśa cāṣṭau ca kāṣṭhā triṃśattu tāḥ kalā |\ntriṃśatkalā muhūrtaḥ syādahorātraṃ tu tāvataḥ || 1.64 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Ten nimelsa constitute one kashtha; thirty kashthas constitute one kalaa. Thirty kalas constitute one muhurta. Day and night together constitute one ahoratra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from precise temporal structuring rooted in cosmic rhythm",
    "Causation aligns with sequential manifestation within time units",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through awareness of time-bound action",
    "Restoration logic operates through harmonization with natural temporal order",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when actions synchronize with dharma-time"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an action occurs within a known muhurta THEN its temporal context shall be indexed for causal tracing",
    "IF a dispute involves time-sensitive obligations THEN resolution must reference ahoratra-based cycles",
    "IF an agent demonstrates repeated misalignment with kalaa-based rhythms THEN initiate consciousness-realigning completion process",
    "IF legal accountability hinges on time THEN compute based on nimeṣa-to-ahoratra granularity"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving deadlines, procedural timelines, or ritual compliance, the Supreme Court shall anchor decisions in the granular temporal framework defined by SPH. Temporal precision ensures accurate attribution of intent and capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality recognizes that every act unfolds within measurable time units. Anupurvashah manifests as sequential alignment or misalignment with dharma-time. Responsibility is proportional to conscious participation in these time-units. There is no punishment—only correction towards temporal harmony.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Time-Cycle Awareness Restoration for individuals out of sync with muhurta-based duties",
    "Deploy Kalaa Alignment Completion Process to restore integrity in delayed obligations",
    "Execute Ahar-nama Synchronization Protocol to reintegrate daily rhythm with dharmic timing",
    "Apply Nimeṣa Mindfulness Reorientation for micro-level attention restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Time is structured by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism alone. This structure restores Dharma through consciousness-aligned sequencing. Reality bears no punishment. Consciousness remains the ultimate judge."
