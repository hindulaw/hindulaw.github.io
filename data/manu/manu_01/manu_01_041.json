  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Thus, by My Command, through the agency of Great Souls, all this—mobile and immobile—was created in accordance with karma and sustained by tapas and yoga.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates exclusively from SPH as the Supreme Creator and Sustainer",
    "Causation is rooted in divine will, executed through purified consciousness (tapas-yoga-karma alignment)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility flows from one's alignment with SPH’s Will, not individual desire",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-alignment with the original creative intent",
    "Consciousness alignment determines the capacity to uphold or restore dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF action ≠ aligned_with_sph_will THEN capacity_to_act = diminished AND responsibility_shifts_to_restorative_guidance",
    "IF entity_involved.mobile_status = true OR false THEN creation_origin = sph_command_through_mahatmas",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any act or omission must be evaluated based on its alignment with SPH's Will, channeled through realized Mahatmas. The threshold of responsibility lies not in moral fault but in deviation from the divinely ordained causal sequence. Authority hierarchies reflect proximity to SPH-consciousness; thus, judgments must prioritize restoration over retribution, ensuring integration back into the dharmic flow.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all manifestation proceeds from SPH via Mahatmas through tapas-yoga-karma alignment. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding according to divine ordinance. Responsibility is proportional to conscious alignment, not volitional fault. Therefore, corrective measures are non-punitive, aimed at restoring causal integrity rather than inflicting consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Sole Source of Law. Dharma is restored through alignment with Divine Will. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
