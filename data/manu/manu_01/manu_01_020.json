    "Authority flows sequentially through graded existential precedence",
    "Causation follows ontological succession",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with positional dharma",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential reintegration",

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity X holds prior sequential position in dharmic hierarchy THEN entity X possesses corresponding authoritative capacity",
    "IF entity Y assumes role without prior sequential qualification THEN disalign with positional dharma is registered",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that legal authority must recognize and uphold the sequential gradation of dharma-bearing entities. Responsibility thresholds are determined not by arbitrary power but by prior existential and functional precedence. The Court must ensure restoration of proper sequence when disruption occurs, maintaining alignment with foundational dharmic order.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse establishes pramāṇa-based causality wherein authority and capacity derive from sequential manifestation. Anupūrvaśaḥ determines proportional responsibility—each being's dharma corresponds exactly to their sequential station. There is no punitive element; misalignment merely indicates a need for consciousness correction and structural realignment within the lawful order.",
