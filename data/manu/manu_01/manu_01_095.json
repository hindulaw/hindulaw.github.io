  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, precedence shall be given to those whose sustained ritual duties uphold cosmic order. Their testimony carries greater weight due to their alignment with celestial and ancestral domains, establishing a threshold of responsibility based on dharma rather than secular authority.",

Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
