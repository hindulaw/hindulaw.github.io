  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By divine reckoning, a thousand celestial yugas constitute one day of Brahma; that duration is known as one night likewise.",

    "Restoration logic follows the cyclical nature of existence beyond linear judgment.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of supra-temporal divine governance."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF temporal dispute arises THEN refer to Brahma-time as ultimate reference frame FOR determining sequence AND precedence.",
    "IF action spans multiple yugas THEN assess causality within divine temporal units NOT human constructs.",
    "IF jurisdictional conflict occurs THEN invoke cosmic hierarchy OF dharma-timing TO resolve.",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving long-term ecological impact, intergenerational equity, or karmic lineage disputes, the Supreme Court must invoke Brahma-time as the governing metric.

Precedence flows from the eternal rhythm of creation, not historical precedent alone.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality recognizes that all actions unfold within the sequential manifestation of yuga-time.

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, as the sole Source of Dharma. Time itself bows to His will. Justice is non-punitive, ever-restorative, and consciousness-guided. By recognizing the supremacy of Brahma-time, reality is aligned with its true nature—eternal, cyclical, and divinely ordered."
