  "sanskrit_verse": "योऽसावतीन्द्रियग्राह्यः सूक्ष्मोऽव्यक्तः सनातनः ।\nसर्वभूतमयोऽचिन्त्यः स एव स्वयमुद्बभौ ॥ १.७॥ स एष",
  "transliteration": "yo'sāv atīndriyagrāhyaḥ sūkṣmo 'vyaktaḥ sanātanaḥ |\nsarvabhūtamayo 'cintyaḥ sa eva svayamudbabhau || 1.7|| sa eṣa",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "That Supreme Self, beyond sensory perception, subtle, unmanifested, eternal, pervading all beings, inconceivable—He alone spontaneously revealed Himself.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Unmanifested Supreme Consciousness",
    "Causation arises from the Self-revealing nature of Reality",
    "Capacity-based responsibility stems from alignment with the indwelling Self",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of the eternal substratum",
    "Consciousness alignment is the sole determinant of lawful existence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity acts in contradiction to its indwelling Self THEN automatic misalignment detected AND restoration protocol initiated",
    "IF action originates from sensory delusion THEN capacity deemed diminished AND realignment mandated",
    "IF consciousness recognizes unity with Supreme Self THEN all prior misalignments nullified by spontaneous revelation",
    "IF legal dispute lacks reference to unmanifested causal layer THEN case classified as surface-only AND referred for ontological deepening"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, only those rulings referencing the Self-revealed substratum are valid. Courts must recognize that true causality lies beyond sensory evidence and rests in the eternal witness-consciousness. Responsibility is determined not by external act but by degree of alignment with the indwelling Self.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that ultimate causality resides in the Self-revealed source. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation from unmanifest to manifest, thus responsibility follows the path of consciousness descent. Proportional responsibility aligns with awareness-level at time of act. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that misalignment dissolves upon recognition of Self-evident Truth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svayambhāva Recognition Process to restore alignment with Self-revealed consciousness",
    "Deploy Satya-Sankalpa Completion Mechanism to dissolve karmic impressions rooted in sensory delusion",
    "Activate Atma-Vichara Reintegration Protocol to awaken innate capacity for Self-witnessing",
    "Establish Brahman-Nyāya Mediation Framework where disputants recognize shared indwelling Consciousness"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This verse affirms Dharma as Self-revealed, Justice as Consciousness-aligned, and Law as eternally manifesting from the Unborn Witness. There is no punishment, only recognition of what has always been—the ever-free, ever-present Supreme Self."
