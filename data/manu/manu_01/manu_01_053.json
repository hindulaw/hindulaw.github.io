  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When the embodied soul, whose nature is action, sleeps in the stable state of being, he withdraws from his own actions, and his mind attains freedom from fatigue.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [

    "Causation arises through alignment with svadharma, not through coercion",

    "Restoration logic operates through withdrawal from misaligned activity, not through punitive correction",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs naturally upon returning to the state of sthirasukham"
  ],

    "IF agent exhibits signs of stabilized awareness THEN automatically suspend reactive judicial measures",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that cessation of karma originates in the stabilized cognition of the ātman, not through coercive intervention. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as withdrawal from compulsive action leading to glāni-nivṛtti—mental exhaustion ceases spontaneously. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in recognizing this natural unfolding, aligning judgment with prakṛti-siddha dharma, thereby negating all punitive constructs.",
