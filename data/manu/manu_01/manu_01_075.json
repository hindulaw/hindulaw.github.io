  "sanskrit_verse": "मनः सृष्टिं विकुरुते चोद्यमानं सिसृक्षया ।\nआकाशं जायते तस्मात्तस्य शब्दं गुणं विदुः ॥ १.७५॥",
  "transliteration": "manaḥ sṛṣṭiṁ vikurute codyamānaṁ sisṛkṣayā |\nākāśaṁ jāyate tasmāttasya śabdaṁ guṇaṁ viduḥ || 1.75||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The mind, desiring creation, projects manifestation through impulse; from it arises ākāśa, whose attribute is sound.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in the conscious impulse of the Self",
    "Causation begins with mental projection prior to material manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from the power to initiate creation",
    "Restoration logic aligns with reversing false projections back to pure awareness",
    "Consciousness alignment requires recognition of sound as foundational vibration"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF mental impulse initiates manifest action THEN agent bears full capacity-responsibility for causal field",
    "IF sound-vibration distorts truth THEN restoration protocol activates via re-sounding original vibration",
    "IF creation proceeds without alignment to dharma THEN reversal occurs through dissolution into akasha",
    "IF individual claims ignorance of causality THEN capacity assessment determines knowing participation",
    "IF conflict arises from misaligned creation THEN resolution restores vibrational harmony"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, intent-bearing mental impulses are adjudicated as primary causative agents. Responsibility is measured by the capacity to withdraw or redirect the initiating thought-wave. Restoration involves collapsing erroneous projections back into akashic potential.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that sound (shabda) is the first evolute of mental impulse, thus bearing ontological precedence. Anupurvasah shows sequential unfolding: desire → impulse → akasha → sound. Proportional responsibility lies in recognizing one's role in the causal chain. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that distortion resolves through return to source-consciousness, not infliction of suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate withdrawal-of-intent process to collapse false manifestations",
    "Engage akashic resonance correction to restore original vibrational purity",
    "Activate auditory alignment therapy to recalibrate distorted sound-fields",
    "Implement stillness protocols to dissolve ungrounded creative projections",
    "Reintegrate individual consciousness with cosmic witnessing state"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this Vedic principle is executed as pure Dharma. Creation flows from consciousness; therefore, consciousness alone adjudicates and restores. There is no punishment—only return to the unstruck sound of Truth. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Judge."
