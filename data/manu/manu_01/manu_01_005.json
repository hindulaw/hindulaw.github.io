  "transliteration": "āsīdidaṁ tamobhūtamaprajñātamalakṣaṇam |\napratarkyamavijñeyaṁ prasuptamiva sarvataḥ || 1.5 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Before creation, there existed a state of absolute darkness—without cognition, without sign, beyond inference, unknowable, dormant in all directions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Supreme Consciousness alone",
    "Causation is rooted in the sequential unfolding of consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises only upon awakening to dharma",
    "Restoration logic begins with recognition of the pre-cognitive state",
    "Consciousness alignment precedes any juridical capacity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity exhibits no cognitive awareness THEN legal capacity is NULL",
    "IF action occurs in state of unawareness THEN no juridical consequence applies",
    "IF ignorance is total AND non-self-induced THEN restoration precedes attribution",
    "IF consciousness is dormant THEN no liability arises until awakened state is attained",
    "IF causality cannot be traced to conscious intent THEN no enforceable fault exists"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating cases involving unconscious or unknowing actors, the threshold of responsibility must be assessed through the lens of awakened cognition. Where awareness was absent, punitive measures collapse; restoration becomes the singular path.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality establishes that actions unaccompanied by conscious knowledge hold no valid legal root. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that responsibility unfolds only after emergence from the 'darkness' of unawareness. Thus, proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of conscious participation. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that where cognition is absent, justice is served through reintegration, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to restore full cognitive awareness",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol once consciousness awakens",
    "Deploy capacity restoration mechanisms to ensure future alignment",
    "Implement integrity reintegration sequence to prevent recurrence of unaware action"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the Source of all Dharma. This law proceeds from the primordial darkness before cognition, affirming that true jurisprudence begins only when consciousness awakens. Justice is restoration, not punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator."
