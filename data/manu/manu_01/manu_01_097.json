  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Among the twice-born, those who know Brahman are seers; among the learned, those whose intellect is refined are wise; among those of refined intellect, those who act rightly are doers; among doers, those who realize Brahman are true knowers.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from realized consciousness, not title or birth alone.",
    "Causation flows through awakened capacity, not external command.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by inner realization, not social role.",
    "Restoration logic aligns action with ultimate knowing—Brahman realization.",
    "Consciousness alignment is the foundation of lawful conduct."

    "IF agent.realization_of_brahman = TRUE THEN authority_level = MAXIMUM",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is direct cognition of Brahman. Causality follows sequential unfoldment of awareness (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to realized capacity. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that all actions resolve through consciousness correction.",
