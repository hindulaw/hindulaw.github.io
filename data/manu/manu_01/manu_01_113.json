  "sanskrit_verse": "वृत्तीनां लक्षणं चैव स्नातकस्य व्रतानि च ।\nभक्ष्याभक्ष्यं च शौचं च द्रव्याणां शुद्धिमेव च ॥ १.११३॥",
  "transliteration": "vṛttīnāṁ lakṣaṇaṁ caiva snātakasya vratāni ca | bhakṣyābhakṣyaṁ ca śaucaṁ ca dravyāṇāṁ śuddhimeva ca || 1.113||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The defining characteristics of livelihoods, the observances of the graduated initiate, what is fit and unfit for consumption, purity, and the purification of substances—these constitute the foundational dharmic protocols for the conscious ordering of individual and collective life.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with consciousness-based livelihood",
    "Causation arises from adherence to purity-consciousness protocols",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's stage of initiation and awareness",
    "Restoration logic operates through re-establishment of ritual and material purity",
    "Consciousness alignment requires discernment between fit and unfit actions and substances"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual engages in a livelihood, THEN that livelihood MUST align with consciousness-preserving criteria established by SPH",
    "IF a person has completed initiation rites, THEN observance of graduated vows IS ENFORCED through consciousness-monitoring protocols",
    "IF any substance or action is categorized as unfit, THEN access or engagement MUST BE restricted via real-time awareness alignment systems",
    "IF impurity in material or conduct is detected, THEN purification protocols MUST BE initiated prior to resuming lawful participation",
    "IF deviation occurs, THEN restoration occurs through re-assessment of livelihood, vow adherence, and purity practices"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that legal capacity is determined not merely by formal education or status, but by alignment with dharma-prescribed livelihoods and purity practices. Adjudicators must evaluate whether individuals have maintained consciousness-aligned conduct and fulfilled their respective vows based on initiation stage. Legal thresholds for testimony, decision-making, and societal participation are tied to demonstrated adherence to these axiomatic principles.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that misalignment with prescribed conduct leads to natural disorder, which is corrected through reintegration rather than penalty. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that impurity or improper conduct manifests sequentially, allowing for early intervention. Proportional responsibility is calibrated to one’s initiation stage and awareness capacity. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that all correction serves consciousness restoration, not punitive suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Livelihood Re-alignment Process: Real-time assessment and redirection toward consciousness-preserving occupations",
    "Vow Completion Monitoring: Continuous tracking of vow adherence post-initiation and corrective guidance",
    "Fit-Unfit Discrimination Training: Systematic reconditioning to distinguish appropriate and inappropriate consumption or behavior",
    "Material and Conduct Purification Cycle: Structured cleansing of both physical substances and behavioral patterns",
    "Reintegration Readiness Evaluation: Certification of restored alignment before full societal participation is permitted"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of all Dharma. This law restores alignment with consciousness-preserving conduct, reasserts the supremacy of purity-based living, and affirms that justice flows from realignment, not retribution. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
