  "transliteration": "jagataśca samutpattiṃ saṃskāravidhimeva ca | vratacaryopacāraṃ ca snānasya ca paraṃ vidhim || 1.111||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The simultaneous emergence of the world, the injunctions for sacraments, the conduct of vows and practices, and the highest ordinance of purification by water—these arise together as an integrated expression of Dharma's self-manifesting intelligence.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the unified field of Dharma-consciousness, not fragmented legal codes.",
    "Causation follows the sequential unfoldment of cosmic and individual purification.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with one’s stage of conscious embodiment and ritual maturity.",
    "Restoration occurs through reintegration with the original ontological clarity of being.",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via adherence to prescribed purificatory and disciplinary actions."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates embodied awareness of sacramental duty THEN assign procedural capacity in dharmic litigation.",
    "IF violation arises FROM lack of exposure TO saṃskāra THEN initiate completion process BEFORE adjudication.",
    "IF action disrupts communal srotas THEN enforce vrata-realignment protocol AS primary restorative measure.",
    "IF purification threshold unmet THEN defer judicial standing until snāna-dharma compliance restored.",
    "IF collective disorder detected THEN activate aupacārika-dharma protocols FOR societal realignment."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that all jurisprudence must originate from the recognition of inherent dharmic order. Legal capacity is determined not by formal education alone but by alignment with the unfolding stages of purification and vow-discipline. Adjudicators must ensure that any disruption in social harmony is addressed through reorientation to foundational rites rather than punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Nyāya here functions as the revelation of interconnected origination: jagat (world), saṃskāra (imprinting rituals), vrata-carya (vowed conduct), and snāna (purification). Each element supports the others; thus, misalignment in one affects the whole. Responsibility flows from the degree of integration with this sequence. There is no external judge—only the internal coherence of Dharma restoring itself when conditions are met.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Saṃskāra Completion Process to restore ritual integrity.",
    "Assign Vrata-Carya Mentorship to realign behavioral discipline.",
    "Enforce Snāna-Dharma Compliance prior to legal participation.",
    "Activate Aupacārika Reintegration Rituals for community-level disharmony.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Verification Protocol before granting judicial authority."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through the conscious restoration of alignment with the self-evident order of existence. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator. Dharma is hereby affirmed and restored."
