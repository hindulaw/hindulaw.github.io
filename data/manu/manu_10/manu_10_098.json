  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Vaiśya who lives by his own dharma but engages in Śūdra-like activities shall desist from unlawful acts and restore himself through capacity-realization.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from svadharma, not social rank",

    "IF individual demonstrates functional misalignment THEN activate svadharma-reclamation sequence",
    "IF no punitive intervention required THEN deploy consciousness-integrity restoration framework"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, when a person of recognized varna engages in conduct beneath their svadharma, the threshold of responsibility lies not in caste-bound definitions but in the individual's capacity to reclaim alignment. Authority flows from realization, not lineage. Restoration precedes retribution.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that karmic misalignment manifests through anupūrvaśaḥ—sequential degradation of purpose. Responsibility is proportional to觉醒 capacity. The non-punitive reality rule declares: suffering is not justice; realignment is the sole lawful response.",
