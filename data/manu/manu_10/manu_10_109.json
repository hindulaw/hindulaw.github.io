  "transliteration": "pratigrahād yājanād vā tathaivādhyāpanād api | pratigrahaḥ pratyavaraḥ pretya viprasya garhitaḥ || 10.109 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Acceptance of gifts, performance of sacrifices for others, or teaching—these acts when performed without alignment with one's svadharma and without conscious capacity result in a degraded state after death for the twice-born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from svadharma alignment, not social position",
    "Causation arises from misaligned action rooted in unconscious capacity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires integrity-preserving engagement",
    "Restoration logic operates through realignment with source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines karmic consequence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs ritual/gift/teaching WITHOUT svadharma alignment THEN consequence is post-existence degradation",
    "IF twice-born engages in dharma-service WITHOUT capacity-integrity THEN action invalidates spiritual progression",
    "IF act violates pramāṇa-based role THEN restoration protocol activates via consciousness-reintegration",
    "IF teaching or service originates from external compulsion THEN it incurs ontological liability"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving religious leadership or dharmic instruction, the threshold of authentic svadharma alignment must be verified before recognizing legitimacy. The court must assess whether actions stem from inner capacity or external pressure, determining authority based on consciousness integrity rather than inherited status.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misaligned service distorts causal flow, leading to sequential degradation (anupūrvaśaḥ). This is not punitive but reflective of natural law: consciousness ungrounded in svadharma cannot sustain elevated existence. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of disconnection from source-awareness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma-realignment process through guided self-inquiry",
    "Engage completion rituals to dissolve residual karmic impressions",
    "Reintegrate individual consciousness with foundational dharma-teachings",
    "Establish capacity-building practices under qualified guidance"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through consciousness realignment; reality remains non-punitive; all beings are called to reclaim svadharma integrity. Thus stands the eternal law."
