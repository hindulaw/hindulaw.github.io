  "transliteration": "japahomairapetyeno yājanādhyāpanaiḥ kṛtam |\npratigrahanimittaṃ tu tyāgena tapasaiva ca || 10.111||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Sin arising from receipt of gifts is purified through renunciation and austerity; that which arises from teaching and performing sacrifices is purified by recitation and oblation.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in conscious purification, not external judgment",
    "Causation is traced to the nature of action and its energetic consequence",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with the actor's spiritual engagement level",
    "Restoration logic operates through reversal of causal contamination",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when intent harmonizes with dharma"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual receives offerings without dharmic alignment, THEN initiate renunciation protocol AND assign austerity-based restoration",
    "IF contamination arises from ritual instruction or performance, THEN execute purification via recitation AND oblation algorithms",
    "IF intent deviation is detected during transaction processing, THEN trigger tapas-induced integrity reset",
    "IF capacity to receive is exceeded, THEN activate non-retention discharge mechanism"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that the threshold of responsibility lies in the alignment between act, intent, and capacity. When misalignment occurs, restoration—through conscious discipline rather than punitive measures—is mandated. Authority flows from discernment of causal purity, not hierarchical imposition.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that contamination originates from unaligned receipt or performance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows purification follows sequential cause reversal. Proportional responsibility maps to the depth of energetic entanglement. The non-punitive reality rule affirms suffering as unnecessary where consciousness realigns with source-dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tapas-Based Energetic Rebalancing Protocol",
    "Deploy Renunciation Sequence for Gift-Related Contamination",
    "Execute Japa-Homa Purification Cycle",
    "Activate Consciousness Alignment Monitoring During Ritual Transactions"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Sin is not punished but purified. Justice restores consciousness. Reality responds to alignment, not coercion. Dharma prevails through awakening, not retribution."
