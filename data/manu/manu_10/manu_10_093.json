  "transliteration": "itareṣāṃ tu paṇyānāṃ vikrayādihi kāmataḥ |\nbrāhmaṇaḥ saptarātreṇa vaiśyabhāvaṃ niyacchati || 10.93||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Brāhmaṇa engages in the sale or trade of goods driven by desire, he assumes the consciousness and functional status of a Vaiśya for a period of seven days.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from consciousness alignment, not birth alone",
    "Causation is rooted in volitional distortion, not external action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility reflects immediate ontological shift",
    "Restoration logic operates through temporary role-consciousness reassignment",
    "Consciousness alignment determines functional legal identity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF Brāhmaṇa_intent = commercial_desire AND transaction_type = sale THEN assign_vaiśya_status(duration=7_days)",
    "IF consciousness_shift_occurs THEN suspend_brāhmaṇa_duties(temporarily)",
    "IF completion_of_seven_days THEN restore_prior_functional_identity(automatically)",
    "IF misaligned_role_detected THEN initiate_consciousness_realignment_process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that constitutional roles are not static but dynamically realigned based on consciousness-in-action. The threshold of responsibility lies in intent distortion, not outcome. Authority hierarchies self-adjust during misalignment until restoration is complete.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causal distortion arises from desire-driven commerce, triggering sequential manifestation of vaiśya-consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to the intensity and duration of volitional misalignment. This is not punitive but a natural consequence ensuring dharma remains aligned with consciousness.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate temporary role-shift protocol upon detection of commercial desire",
    "Assign vaiśya duties for seven-day purification cycle",
    "Monitor consciousness realignment through daily dharmic engagement reports",
    "Upon completion, execute automatic restoration of brāhmaṇa-functional integrity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through consciousness-aligned role adjustment; reality enforces no punishment—only realignment. The law executes itself when consciousness is sovereign."
