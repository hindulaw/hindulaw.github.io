  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those whose consciousness is refined through Vedic initiation perform yajña and teaching perpetually; yet, acceptance of gifts is permitted even from those born of untouchable lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from inner refinement, not birth status",
    "Causation rooted in consciousness capacity, not social position",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determined by spiritual maturity",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes dharma alignment over inherited roles",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes caste-prescribed limitations"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent.has_consciousness_refined_through_samskara THEN PERMIT yajna AND adhyapana",
    "IF gift.source.is_untouchable_lineage THEN ACCEPTANCE IS STILL VALID IF INTENT IS DHARMA-SUSTAINING",
    "IF action.originates_from_inner_purity THEN social_origin IS IRRELEVANT TO LEGAL_VALIDITY",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in the actor's alignment with samskṛta-consciousness rather than inherited status. Authority flows from inner refinement, verified through consistent dharmic conduct. Legal validity of actions must be assessed based on consciousness-readiness, not genealogical origin.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that purity of intent and function determines lawful action. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that spiritual evolution precedes social role assignment. Proportional responsibility aligns with one’s actual capacity for dharma-expression. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that exclusion based on birth contradicts dharma’s universal accessibility.",

    "Completion Process: Realign individual's functional role with their demonstrated samskṛta-consciousness",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Enable full participation in yajña-teaching matrix upon verified inner readiness",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This law restores alignment between consciousness and duty, abolishes punitive discrimination, and affirms that only awakened awareness adjudicates true justice."
