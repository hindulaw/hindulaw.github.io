The threshold of responsibility lies in ensuring that no individual suffers diminishment due to their origin while upholding dharma-based societal harmony.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes clear causal connection between parental identity and progeny categorization. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests through sequential unfoldment of consciousness within structured roles. Proportional responsibility ensures accurate recognition without stigma.
