  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रकल्प्या तस्य तैर्वृत्तिः स्वकुटुम्बाद्यथार्हतः ।\nशक्तिं चावेक्ष्य दाक्ष्यं च भृत्यानां च परिग्रहम् ॥ १०.१२४॥",
  "transliteration": "prakalpyā tasya tairvṛttiḥ svakuṭumbādyathārhatḥ |\nśaktiṁ cāvekṣya dākṣyaṁ ca bhṛtyānāṁ ca parigraham || 10.124||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The sustenance of a person and their household must be arranged according to eligibility, considering capacity, skillfulness, and the ability to maintain servants or employees.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from capacity to sustain and organize life",
    "Causation arises through conscious arrangement aligned with dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility determines lawful entitlement",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes functional integration over punitive oversight",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures harmony between individual action and collective welfare"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates capacity to sustain household AND employs others, THEN agent is authorized to allocate resources accordingly",
    "IF resource allocation does not exceed demonstrated capacity, THEN no judicial interference occurs",
    "IF incapacity leads to disarray in household maintenance, THEN restoration protocol initiates support structures based on eligibility assessment",
    "IF skill level declines without cause, THEN retraining or realignment mechanisms activate automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this verse establishes that economic and domestic authority flows from demonstrated capability. Judicial review must assess whether an individual's resource management aligns with their proven capacity rather than abstract standards. Thresholds for intervention are tied to breakdown in functionality, not perceived inadequacy.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse reflects pramāṇa-based causality by linking eligibility directly to demonstrated capacity. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential development of skills leading to greater responsibilities. Responsibility is proportional to maintained competence, ensuring alignment with natural law rather than imposed judgment. No punitive consequence arises; instead, systemic recalibration activates when misalignment occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate capacity-assessment protocol upon reported dysfunction in household or employment structure",
    "Deploy skill-enhancement modules where deficiencies identified",
    "Realign resource distribution to match current demonstrable ability",
    "Facilitate mentorship or advisory engagement to restore operational integrity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through recognition of capacity-driven eligibility. Justice operates solely for consciousness realignment and structural harmony. Reality remains non-punitive under all conditions. Consciousness itself stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
