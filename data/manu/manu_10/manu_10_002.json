  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that those in positions of spiritual and intellectual authority bear a non-delegable duty to both understand and transmit universal principles of dharma. The threshold of responsibility is not punitive but ontological — failure to fulfill this role necessitates immediate restorative intervention by way of reintegration into correct conduct and consciousness.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa is established through direct cognition and authoritative instruction; anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential unfoldment from knowing to teaching to living. Responsibility is proportional to capacity, and corrective action focuses on restoring integrity rather than imposing suffering. Truth is realized through embodiment, not coercion.",
