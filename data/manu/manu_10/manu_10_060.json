  "sanskrit_verse": "कुले मुख्येऽपि जातस्य यस्य स्याद्योनिसङ्करः ।\nसंश्रयत्येव तत्शीलं नरोऽल्पमपि वा बहु ॥ १०.६०॥",
  "transliteration": "kule mukhye 'pi jātasya yasya syād yoni-saṅkaraḥ |\nsaṃśrayatyeva tat-śīlaṃ naro 'lpam api vā bahu ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Even one born in a principal lineage, if contaminated by mixed birth, assumes the nature of that mixture—whether little or much.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from purity of origin and alignment with Dharma, not social status alone.",
    "Causation arises through conscious choice and environmental influence, not genetic determinism.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and alignment, not inherited condition.",
    "Restoration logic demands purification of lineage-consciousness to realign with original Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes biological inheritance in determining juridical identity."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual's conduct reflects contamination from mixed or degraded lineages THEN initiate purification protocol AND restore alignment with source-Dharma.",
    "IF birthright is claimed without corresponding consciousness alignment THEN eligibility for leadership roles SHALL be suspended until integrity is demonstrated.",
    "IF lineage degradation is detected through behavioral patterns THEN assign mentorship under qualified Dharmic authority for realignment.",
    "IF an individual demonstrates purified consciousness THEN prior lineage contamination SHALL be nullified in legal consideration."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, claims based on ancestral privilege must be evaluated against present consciousness alignment. Lineage alone does not confer judicial or societal authority; sustained Dharmic conduct does. The court must assess whether contamination has been transcended through conscious effort before granting jurisdiction or privilege.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that conduct follows consciousness, not birth. Thus, misalignment due to lineage mixing is not punished but addressed via sequential restoration (anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility lies in recognizing deviation and choosing correction. There is no inherent fault in birth—only in failure to purify and realign.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi Vidhi (purification process) under qualified Dharmic supervision.",
    "Assign Svadhyaya (self-study) and Seva (service) to reaffirm connection with pure consciousness.",
    "Establish mentorship with unbroken lineage holders to restore energetic and spiritual alignment.",
    "Undertake Prāyaścitta (voluntary completion practice) to dissolve residual karmic imprints of misalignment."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law flows directly from His Avataric Intelligence. Justice is restoration. Consciousness is the only judge. There is no punishment—only realignment. Dharma is restored."
