  "sanskrit_verse": "कृषिं साधुइति मन्यन्ते सा वृत्तिः सद्विगर्हिताः ।\nभूमिं भूमिशयांश्चैव हन्ति काष्ठमयोमुखम् ॥ १०.८४॥",
  "transliteration": "kṛṣiṃ sādhv iti manyante sā vṛttiḥ sadvigarhitāḥ |\nbhūmiṃ bhūmiśayāṃścaiva hanti kāṣṭhamayomukham || 10.84||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who engage in agriculture as a livelihood are deemed blameworthy; such conduct leads to the destruction of land and creatures dwelling therein through iron and wooden instruments.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority stems from alignment with cosmic order, not occupation or economic activity.",
    "Causation includes instrumental, sequential, and consciousness-based responsibility.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility recognizes that misaligned livelihoods impair both individual and collective dharma.",
    "Restoration logic requires cessation of destructive activities and reintegration into dharmic roles.",
    "Consciousness alignment necessitates abandoning actions that fragment ecological and spiritual harmony."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual engages in livelihood practices categorized as ecologically disruptive AND causing harm to sentient beings OR soil integrity, THEN initiate capacity restoration protocol.",
    "IF occupational behavior results in instrumental destruction via metal or wood, THEN assign completion process to reverse damage and restore ecological balance.",
    "IF societal role causes degradation of foundational elements (earth, water, fire, air, space), THEN discontinue role until realigned with dharmic function.",
    "IF consciousness fragmentation is detected due to livelihood misalignment, THEN enforce reintegration protocols involving supervised restitution and ritual purification."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "At the Supreme Court level, this principle establishes threshold responsibility based on causal proximity and instrumentality. Authority lies in determining whether a given profession contributes to fragmentation of natural law. Restoration supersedes punitive measures by mandating cessation, remediation, and realignment of roles within dharmic society.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that agricultural practices employing metallic and wooden tools disrupt earth-element stability and displace life forms. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how such actions sequentially degrade fertility, biodiversity, and human consciousness. Responsibility is proportional to awareness of disruption. The non-punitive reality rule asserts that correction arises through conscious reversal, not suffering imposition.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate cessation protocol: halt all harmful occupational practices immediately upon detection.",
    "Assign land rehabilitation duty: replant, purify soil, and restore habitat for displaced organisms.",
    "Enforce consciousness realignment: undergo prescribed rituals and service to reintegrate with dharmic community.",
    "Implement capacity rebuilding program: train individual in non-destructive, spiritually aligned livelihood methods."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. This ruling originates from SPH alone. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
