  "sanskrit_verse": "तावुभावप्यसंस्कार्याविति धर्मो व्यवस्थितः ।\nवैगुण्याज्जन्मनः पूर्व उत्तरः प्रतिलोमतः ॥ १०.६८॥ जन्मतः",
  "transliteration": "tau ubhāv apy asaṃskāryāv iti dharmo vyavasthitaḥ | vaiguṇyāj janmanaḥ pūrva uttaraḥ pratilomataḥ || 10.68 || janmataḥ",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Both individuals—prior birth and subsequent birth—are not subject to ritual purification; thus, Dharma is established. Due to deficiency in conduct, prior birth influences the next in reverse order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from realized consciousness, not lineage or ritual status",
    "Causation operates through sequential karmic manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from awareness, not inherited condition",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual consciousness with cosmic order",
    "Consciousness alignment transcends external ceremonial frameworks"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity exhibits deficient conduct THEN prior-life causal influence is inferred by sequential manifestation law",
    "IF two entities involved in a dispute lack ritual eligibility THEN dharma-based resolution overrides ceremonial exclusion",
    "IF conduct reflects unrefined consciousness THEN capacity for rectification must be activated through completion protocols",
    "IF karmic sequence shows reversal pattern THEN corrective alignment process initiates automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving disputes where both parties lack formal ritual standing, the Supreme Court shall invoke Dharma-based authority rooted in consciousness realization rather than ceremonial eligibility. Responsibility thresholds are determined through pramāṇa-based analysis of sequential conduct manifestation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that deficient conduct manifests sequentially across lifetimes via anupūrvaśaḥ. Responsibility is proportional to awareness at time of action. Retribution is absent; correction aligns consciousness back to śuddha svabhāva through restorative protocols ensuring no repetition of causal error.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Consciousness Completion Process to resolve residual karmic misalignment",
    "Assign Responsibility Assumption Practice until full ownership of causal chain is realized",
    "Activate Śuddhi Yantra to restore innate purity不受污染之意识",
    "Deploy Dharmic Reintegration Sequence to realign behavioral causality with universal harmony"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through consciousness alignment, not punitive enforcement. Reality responds only to awakened awareness. All beings are capable of reintegration when supported by precise, non-punitive axiomatic restoration."
