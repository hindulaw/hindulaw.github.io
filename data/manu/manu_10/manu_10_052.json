  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Renunciation of material identification includes wearing discarded garments, eating from broken vessels, adorning with iron ornaments, and perpetual wandering as a mendicant.",

The threshold for recognition lies in demonstrable adherence to these axiomatic behaviors.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that true renunciation negates prior causal conditions rooted in material entanglement.
