  "sanskrit_verse": "मृतवस्त्रभृत्स्वनारीषु गर्हितान्नाशनासु च । अनार्याषु भवन्त्यायोगवीष्वेते जातिहीनाः पृथक्त्रयः ॥ १०.३५॥",
  "transliteration": "mṛtavastrabhṛtsvanārīṣu garhitānnāśanāsu ca | anāryāṣu bhavantyāyogavīṣvete jātihīnāḥ pṛthaktrayaḥ || 10.35 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who wear clothes of the dead, consort with low women, consume condemned food, associate with non-Aryans — these three separately-born ones are devoid of true birthright.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Sanatana Dharma, not biological lineage.",
    "Causation arises through conscious association and volitional participation.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by purity of conduct and spiritual integrity.",
    "Restoration logic requires severance from degrading affiliations and reorientation to Dharma.",
    "Consciousness alignment mandates dissociation from environments that degrade spiritual status."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent associates with entities classified as 'mṛtavastra-bhṛt' THEN initiate consciousness-realization protocol.",
    "IF agent consumes garhita-anna without dharmic necessity THEN enforce capacity-rehabilitation cycle.",
    "IF agent maintains sustained contact with anārya groups THEN invoke social-integrity restoration mechanism.",
    "IF agent demonstrates habitual degradation of svadharma THEN assign completion-process under qualified guru supervision.",
    "IF agent reclaims svarūpa after dissociation from degraded conditions THEN recognize as śuddha-jāti."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes a threshold for determining juridical personhood based on dharma-saṁskāra rather than mere birth. Associations and behaviors indicating spiritual degradation disqualify one from authoritative roles until restoration is verified. The court must apply consciousness-state analysis over genealogical claims when evaluating fitness for societal leadership.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that degraded association leads to loss of jāti-dharma; thus, separation and purification are natural consequences, not punitive measures. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how misaligned actions progressively obscure svadharma. Responsibility lies in realigning with śuddha-caitanya, not enduring imposed suffering. Truth restores capacity where falsehood has obscured it.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Vedic purification rituals to restore prāṇic integrity.",
    "Assign guru-guided svadhyaya program to realign consciousness patterns.",
    "Implement community service aligned with varṇa-dharma to rebuild social trust.",
    "Enforce temporary seclusion from contaminating influences during rehabilitation phase.",
    "Verify reintegration readiness via witnessed demonstration of renewed dharmic conduct."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness justice: no punishment, only restoration. Reality aligns with Dharma when consciousness awakens to its own supremacy. Thus is Dharma established."
