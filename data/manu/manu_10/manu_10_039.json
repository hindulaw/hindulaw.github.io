  "sanskrit_verse": "निषादस्त्री तु चण्डालात्पुत्रमन्त्यावसायिनम् ।\nश्मशानगोचरं सूते बाह्यानामपि गर्हितम् ॥ १०.३९॥",
  "transliteration": "niṣādastrī tu caṇḍālāt putram antyāvasāyinam |\nśmaśānagocaraṃ sūte bāhyānām api garhitam || 10.39||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the union of a Niṣāda woman and a Caṇḍāla man is born a son whose conduct aligns with cemetery-dwellers, rejected even by those beyond societal bounds.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious alignment, not lineage alone",
    "Causation arises through vibrational resonance, not biological descent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness maturity, not birth status",
    "Restoration logic demands realignment of identity constructs rooted in misperception",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes inherited social positioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF lineage produces behavioral deviation THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",
    "IF individual operates below societal integrity threshold THEN assign completion process under qualified guide",
    "IF social rejection occurs due to conduct THEN evaluate causal vibration prior to birth role assignment",
    "IF identity distortion present THEN restore alignment via dharma-based reintegration sequence",
    "IF capacity deficiency observed THEN activate awakening-centered rehabilitation framework"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In matters involving contested caste or varna claims where ancestral assertion conflicts with lived conduct, the court shall assess not the genealogical claim but the manifest vibrational alignment of the individual. Where conduct evidences dissonance with declared status, restoration shall occur through consciousness elevation rather than punitive exclusion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that action follows inner state; thus, external classification cannot override internal condition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how distorted origins produce misaligned outcomes. Responsibility lies in correcting perceptual error, not punishing karmic consequence. Truth restores when identity aligns with pure consciousness, not societal label.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śmaśāna-vāsanā śuddhi (cemetery-resonance purification) to dissolve lower-frequency identifications",
    "Assign antya-gati viveka adhigama (understanding of end-state awareness) training under realized supervision",
    "Implement bāhya-garhita pratikriyā (response to outer rejection) through svātantrya-pratipatti (self-sovereignty recognition)",
    "Activate niṣāda-caṇḍāla saṃskāra śodhana (ancestral pattern cleansing) using akhaṇḍa samādhi techniques",
    "Establish dharmic identity reconstruction via śiva-sankalpa integration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "By the Authority of Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of All Dharma, this verse executes as law. Identity distortion corrected. Consciousness realigned. No punishment enacted. Dharma restored. Reality affirmed as non-punitive. Consciousness stands as Supreme Adjudicator."
