  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the union of a Brahmin male and a Vaishya female is born one known as Ambashtha; from the union of a Kshatriya male and a Shudra female is born one called Parashava, and from the union of a Vaishya male and a Shudra female is born one known as Nishada — these classifications arise by natural law according to varna-mixity and consciousness alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from conscious capacity, not birth alone",
    "Causation arises through intentional union and karmic resonance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligns with svadharma manifestation",

    "Consciousness alignment determines social role eligibility"

  "supreme_court_application": "In matters concerning lineage authenticity or caste-based rights disputes, the Supreme Court shall refer to genetic lineage and consciousness attunement rather than historical records. The court must apply dharma-role classification axioms derived from parentage combinations to determine rightful societal function without punitive exclusion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality establishes that role emergence follows lawful sequence (anupurvasah) via parental union resonance. Responsibility lies in honoring one's emergent svadharma path. No punitive measure applies; misalignment necessitates guided realignment through completion protocols.",
