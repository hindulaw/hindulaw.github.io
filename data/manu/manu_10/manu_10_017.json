  "sanskrit_verse": "वैश्यान् मागधवैदेहौ क्षत्रियात्सूत एव तु ।\nप्रतीपमेते जायन्ते परेऽप्यपसदास्त्रयः ॥ १०.१७॥",
  "transliteration": "vaiśyān māgadhavaidehau kṣatriyātsūta eva tu |\npratīpamete jāyante pare'pyapasadāstrayaḥ || 10.17 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From Vaishyas arise Magadha and Videha; from Kshatriyas, Suta. These three, though born contrary to Varna order, still emerge from higher origins and retain capacity for alignment when properly guided.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is not negated by birth irregularity",
    "Causation flows from source-consciousness, not social form",
    "Capacity-based responsibility transcends lineage constraints",
    "Restoration logic honors inherent potential over positional error",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes structural misplacement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual exhibits functional capacity THEN assign role accordingly regardless of origin discrepancy",
    "IF consciousness distortion detected THEN initiate realignment process before determining jurisdictional fit",
    "IF birth-based classification conflicts with operational capability THEN prioritize experiential integrity in adjudication",
    "IF societal deviation observed THEN trace causal sequence to restore natural function rather than enforce punitive correction"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this principle establishes that individuals emerging from non-traditional varna alignments must be evaluated based on their operative capacity and consciousness state, not lineage alone. The threshold of responsibility lies in actualized awareness, not inherited status.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals these beings arise through sequential manifestation beyond conventional boundaries. Their emergence follows anupūrvaśaḥ—causal unfolding—not moral fault. Responsibility aligns proportionally to觉醒 level, not birth-position. Retribution has no place where consciousness remains capable of redirection.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process to harmonize current role with latent capacity",
    "Engage responsibility assumption protocol via guided self-recognition",
    "Implement capacity restoration through conscious alignment practices",
    "Facilitate integrity reintegration within broader societal framework"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma stands restored through recognition of consciousness supremacy. Justice executes as reintegration, not punishment. Reality operates beyond punitive constructs. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
