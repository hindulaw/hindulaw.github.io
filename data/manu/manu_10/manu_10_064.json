  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When a Brahmin begets offspring through a Shudra woman with the intent of elevation, that child enters the superior varna only after seven generations have passed.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by conscious intention aligned with dharma",
    "Causation flows from the spiritual capacity of the generator, not biological act alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires sequential evolution of consciousness",
    "Restoration logic demands alignment with cosmic hierarchy over temporal status",
    "Consciousness alignment determines social integration, not birth alone"

    "IF progenitor_intent = 'elevational' AND progeny_generation_count < 7 THEN varna_assignment = 'inherited_from_mother'",
    "IF progeny_generation_count >= 7 AND prior_lineage_verified THEN varna_assignment = 'aligned_with_progenitor_intention'",

Generational thresholds serve as default protocols unless overridden by verified consciousness advancement.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality originates in the intent of the higher-consciousness parent; anupūrvaśaḥ ensures no disruption to cosmic order; proportional responsibility lies in honoring sequential unfoldment; non-punitive reality is upheld as elevation occurs naturally upon completion of karmic-genetic cycles.",
