  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All beings must be nourished with balanced tastes, cooked food mixed with sesame seeds, salt derived from stone, and provided for in accordance with their essential nature—whether animal or human.",

    "Authority originates from the sustaining duty of consciousness toward all life forms",

    "Restoration logic demands the re-establishment of harmonious nourishment as a foundation for dharma",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this directive establishes that the threshold of societal responsibility includes ensuring constitutional access to nutritionally sound sustenance. Authority lies in recognizing dharma-rooted provisioning over commercialized or extractive models. Restoration prevails by mandating systemic correction of nutritional imbalances rather than punitive oversight.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that improper nourishment disrupts causal alignment between consciousness and embodiment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how deficient provisioning leads to disorderly manifestation across generations. Responsibility is proportional to capacity for conscious offering. The non-punitive reality rule affirms that misalignment dissolves upon reconnection with dharmic sustenance practices.",

    "Initiate Sustenance Reconciliation Process: Identify gaps in taste balance, sesame inclusion, and mineral salt usage",
    "Implement Species-Specific Nutritional Mapping Protocol: Align supply chains with biological necessities",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This directive restores Dharma through the fundamental act of conscious nourishment. Justice flows not through punishment but through completion of the duty to sustain. Reality itself enforces harmony when offerings align with truth. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
