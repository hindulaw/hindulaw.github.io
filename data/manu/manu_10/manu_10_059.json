  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One born of paternal lineage follows paternal conduct; one of maternal, follows maternal; one of both, follows both. Never does a degraded birth control its own nature.",

    "Authority through lineage determines behavioral alignment",
    "Causation arises from inherent ontological conditioning",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication at the highest level, the court must determine the foundational dharmic context of the actor—not through punitive attribution but by identifying their true causal matrix. This establishes rightful expectations and corrects deviation through reorientation rather than condemnation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa confirms that conduct stems from inherent condition, not arbitrary will. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misalignment is sequential, not essential. Thus, proportional responsibility lies in restoring natural order without imposing suffering. The reality rule remains: no being controls its nature apart from conscious awakening.",
