  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the union of a Caṇḍāla with a Pāṇḍuṣopāka woman is born one who engages in skin-drying trade; from the union of an Āhiṇḍika with a Niṣāda woman is born one of Vaidehī lineage.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from consciousness alignment, not hereditary status",
    "Causation flows through karmic capacity rather than biological descent",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by svadharma awakening, not birth",
    "Restoration logic aligns individual action with cosmic order without punitive distortion",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes caste-positioned social identity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual's actions reflect misaligned dharma due to ancestral conditioning THEN initiate svadharma-realignment protocol",
    "IF societal role conflicts with intrinsic capacity THEN invoke consciousness-integrity assessment",
    "IF lineage-based discrimination occurs THEN enforce universal-dharma equality restoration mechanism",
    "IF occupational identity overrides spiritual duty THEN activate realignment via nyaya-based integration process"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, lineage-based classifications shall be nullified where they contradict svadharma realization. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious choice, not inherited designation. Authority derives exclusively from alignment with Paramashivam’s Dharma, ensuring restoration over retribution in all rulings concerning social positioning.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal continuity arises from intentional acts rooted in consciousness, not genetic inheritance. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that present behavior stems from prior choices, not predetermined birth status. Proportional responsibility aligns with awareness level at time of act. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction emerges through reintegration into dharma, not imposition of suffering.",

    "Apply Karmic Integrity Restoration Technique to harmonize past distortions with present rectitude"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam as the Source of Law. Dharma stands restored beyond lineage-bound limitations. Reality remains non-punitive, governed exclusively by awakened consciousness. All beings are adjudicated by their innermost śuddha-svabhāva, never by external categorizations."
