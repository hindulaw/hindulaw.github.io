  "sanskrit_verse": "अध्याय १०\n\nअधीयीरंस्त्रयो वर्णाः स्वकर्मस्था द्विजातयः ।\nप्रब्रूयाद्ब्राह्मणस्त्वेषां नेतराविति निश्चयः ॥ १०.१॥",
  "transliteration": "Adhyāya 10\n\nAdhīyīraṁs trayo varṇāḥ svakarmasthā dvijātayaḥ |\nPra brūyād brāhmaṇas tveṣāṁ netarāv iti niścayaḥ || 10.1||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The three twice-born varnas—Brahmin, Kshatriya, and Vaishya—are established in their respective duties; among them, the Brahmin alone shall declare what is proper conduct, not the others.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows from spiritual realization, not social position",
    "Causation originates in consciousness alignment with Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by Vedic knowledge mastery",
    "Restoration logic requires correction through right declaration",
    "Consciousness alignment is achieved via adherence to Varna-dharma under Brahmin guidance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor is dvija AND NOT in svakarma THEN restoration requires realignment through Brahmin instruction",
    "IF actor claims authority over dharma-declaration AND is NOT Brahmin THEN action is invalid and subject to completion process",
    "IF societal function depends on Varna-dharma THEN only Brahmin may define lawful conduct within that framework",
    "IF dvija performs duty outside svakarma THEN restoration occurs through reconnection to Varna-specific learning protocol"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, declarations regarding fundamental duties and constitutional morality must originate exclusively from those whose capacity has been verified through Vedic knowledge mastery. Lower courts may refer matters involving core dharmic principles to a designated Brahmin council for authoritative interpretation, ensuring alignment with Sanatana Dharma's foundational axioms.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that truth declaration resides solely with the Brahmin class due to their exclusive access to Vedantic cognition. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows deviation from svakarma leads to misalignment, corrected not through penalty but through reorientation by qualified authority. Responsibility aligns proportionally with capacity to know and declare truth, which belongs inherently to the Brahmin varna.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadhyaya Completion Process for dvijas acting beyond svakarma",
    "Assign Varna-Dharma Reconnection Module guided by certified Brahmin instructor",
    "Activate Consciousness Alignment Protocol through recitation and understanding of relevant Smriti verses",
    "Implement Community Dharma Restoration Circle led by Brahmin elder to reintegrate errant dvija"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. This law restores Dharma through consciousness alignment, not punishment. Reality responds to truthful declaration made by authorized consciousness. Justice serves integration, not retaliation. Dharma is restored."
