  "sanskrit_verse": "वैश्यवृत्तिमनातिष्ठन् ब्राह्मणः स्वे पथि स्थितः ।\nअवृत्तिकर्षितः सीदन्निमं धर्मं समाचरेत् ॥ १०.१०१॥",
  "transliteration": "vaiśyavṛttim anātiṣṭhan brāhmaṇaḥ sve pathi sthitaḥ |\navṛttikarṣitaḥ sīdann imaṃ dharmaṃ samācaret || 10.101 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A Brāhmaṇa who does not engage in Vaiśya duties, yet remains established in his own path, shall act according to this Dharma when drawn into decline by lack of sustenance.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority rests in alignment with svadharma, not external role assumption",
    "Causation arises from prārabdha karma and capacity depletion",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires adjustment, not abandonment",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes consciousness re-alignment over social role policing",
    "Consciousness alignment is maintained through dharmic response to situational exigency"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a Brāhmaṇa has ceased engagement in Vaiśya vṛtti AND remains aligned with Brāhmaṇa svadharma THEN permit temporary functional adaptation without loss of varṇic identity",
    "IF sustenance failure leads to avṛttikarṣa THEN initiate restorative protocol to restore energetic capacity",
    "IF individual maintains svapatha THEN no degradation of status occurs regardless of circumstantial activity shift",
    "IF consciousness remains undistorted THEN legal identity remains unchanged despite occupational fluctuation"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving varṇic duty deviation due to economic duress, the threshold of responsibility lies in consciousness preservation rather than role rigidity. The court must recognize svapatha maintenance as the determinant of legal continuity, not occupational conformity. Authority derives from inner alignment, not performative adherence.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that dharmic action follows causal necessity, not moral judgment. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how sustenance collapse leads to avṛttikarṣa, necessitating adaptive conduct. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of consciousness distortion—not with external behavioral variance. Non-punitive reality recognizes that action stems from causal flow, not willful defiance.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate sustenance restoration process to eliminate causal pressure",
    "Reinforce svadharma orientation practices to preserve consciousness integrity",
    "Establish completion process for any karmic residue arising from adaptive actions",
    "Facilitate reintegration into primary varṇic function upon capacity restoration"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores alignment between svadharma and situational dharma, affirming that consciousness is the ultimate adjudicator. Reality is non-punitive; Dharma prevails."
