  "sanskrit_verse": "द्विजातयः सवर्णासु जनयन्त्यव्रतांस्तु यान् ।\nतान् सावित्रीपरिभ्रष्टान् व्रात्यानिति विनिर्दिशेत् ॥ १०.२०॥",
  "transliteration": "dvijātayaḥ savarṇāsu janayantyavrataṃstu yān .\ntān sāvitrīparibhraṣṭān vrātyān iti vinirdiśet .. 10.20 ..",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those born of twice-born males to women of the same varna who have abandoned their vows are declared as fallen from Savitri; such beings shall be designated as Vratyas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in adherence to vow and dharma, not birth alone.",
    "Causation is determined by integrity deviation in ritual and conduct.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured through alignment with initiated consciousness.",
    "Restoration logic requires re-initiation and reintegration into dharmic order.",
    "Consciousness alignment depends upon purification and renewal of sacred commitment."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being is identified as having been born to a twice-born male and a same-varna woman AND has abandoned ritual obligations THEN designate that being as 'Vratya'.",
    "IF a being is designated as 'Vratya' THEN initiate restoration protocol via re-consecration process.",
    "IF any societal role or privilege was previously granted based on lineage THEN revoke access until completion of purification and re-initiation.",
    "IF consciousness misalignment is detected due to abandonment of vow THEN assign capacity-restoring practices under supervision."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying whether the individual has consciously abandoned their vow-bound duties. The court must recognize that mere birth does not confer status without sustained alignment. Authority hierarchy mandates that spiritual initiation supersedes biological inheritance when vow integrity is compromised. Restoration takes precedence over exclusion by invoking re-consecration procedures aligned with original dharmic intent.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causal disjunction arises from breaking of vow-consciousness continuity. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how abandonment leads to systemic misalignment. Proportional responsibility focuses on the extent of vow deviation rather than punitive consequence. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that exclusion serves only as preparatory stage for conscious re-entry into dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Savitri-renewal ceremony under qualified guru supervision.",
    "Assign completion process involving recitation of Gayatri and purification rituals.",
    "Re-establish connection with initiating lineage or appoint substitute spiritual guide.",
    "Undertake public acknowledgment of vow-abandonment followed by declaration of intent to restore.",
    "Integrate into community service framework designed to rebuild dharmic capacity."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through recognition and rectification of vow-consciousness disruption. Reality remains non-punitive; all enforcement aims at realigning awareness with its source. Consciousness itself is the ultimate judge and redeemer."
