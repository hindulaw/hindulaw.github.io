  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those Brahmins established in Brahmic origin who remain steadfast in their own dharma shall sustain themselves rightly through the sixfold occupational duties, in proper order.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from alignment with ontological origin",
    "Causation flows from svadharma-sthiti (establishment in self-duty)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by existential alignment, not external imposition",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to source-dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful action and rightful sustenance"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF entity = Brahmin AND svakarman-sthita = TRUE THEN right_to_sustain_through_shatkarmas = ENABLED",
    "IF svadharma-vilopa detected THEN initiate pratyāhāra protocol FOR restoration TO brahmayoni-sthiti",
    "IF karmic alignment ≠ causal origin THEN restrict access TO transactional privileges UNTIL realignment achieved",
    "IF consciousness-state = brahmic THEN capacity-responsibility = maximum AND authority-source = self-evident"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the threshold of responsibility for a Brahmin defendant lies in verifying svakarman-sthiti. If proven established in svadharma, all actions flowing therefrom are intrinsically lawful. Hierarchical authority is recognized only when aligned with ontological origin, not institutional position.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa-based causality confirms that lawful conduct arises from svakarman-sthiti. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that misalignment leads to unsustainable existence, not punitive consequence. Responsibility is proportional to the degree of alignment with Brahmic origin. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that misaligned action self-corrects through natural dharmic dissonance.",

    "Initiate svadharma-pratipatti completion process",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through alignment with Brahmic origin. Reality is non-punitive; consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
