  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One born of a noble woman by a non-noble man becomes noble through virtues; yet one born of a non-noble woman by a noble man remains non-noble—this is certain.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority inheres in the maternal lineage when paternity lacks integrity",
    "Causation flows from the embodied capacity of the mother's consciousness",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from karmic alignment, not biological inheritance alone",
    "Restoration logic demands recognition of actualized virtue over nominal birth status",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes caste-determined identity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF birth context involves noble maternal origin AND demonstrated virtuous conduct THEN social nobility is recognized",
    "IF birth context involves non-noble maternal origin THEN social nobility cannot be claimed regardless of paternal status",
    "IF individual exhibits noble qualities THEN societal integration shall reflect such realization",
    "IF lineage conflict occurs THEN maternal spiritual capacity determines jurisdictional precedence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving hereditary privilege or caste-based claims, the court must prioritize maternal spiritual capacity and demonstrated virtue over patrilineal assertions. The threshold for responsibility lies in conscious choice and behavioral alignment rather than inherited designation.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that consciousness manifests through action, not title. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals that nobility emerges through sustained dharmic living, not birthright. Responsibility aligns with the degree of self-realization attained. There is no punitive consequence—only recognition of what has been actualized.",
