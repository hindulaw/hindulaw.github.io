  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Renunciation of the body without expectation or condition for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa, a cow, or in acceptance by a woman or child — this is the cause of accomplishment for external beings.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from selfless renunciatory acts aligned with Dharma",
    "Causation arises through spontaneous integrity, not contractual exchange",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is measured by readiness to surrender egoic attachment",
    "Restoration logic operates through unmediated giving and conscious consent",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when action flows without instrumental motive"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs act of bodily sacrifice FOR brāhmaṇa OR cow THEN dharma_completion_score += 1.0",
    "IF strī OR bāla accepts offering WITHOUT coercion THEN legitimacy_of_gift = TRUE",
    "IF no expectation of reward EXISTS during renunciatory act THEN karmic_obligation_dissolves = TRUE",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving renunciatory actions or gifts, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying absence of expectation and presence of dharmic intent. Authority flows from authenticity of surrender, not institutional validation. Courts must recognize that true completion arises from spontaneous alignment, requiring minimal intervention beyond verification of voluntary integrity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes causality via direct observation of intent and absence of possessiveness. Anupūrvaśaḥ manifests as sequential purification of egoic attachments leading to harmony. Responsibility aligns proportionally with clarity of surrender. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that all outcomes emerge from inherent dharmic order, not imposed consequence.",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of Law. Dharma is restored through spontaneous renunciation and conscious acceptance. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
