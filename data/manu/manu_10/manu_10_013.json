  "sph_interpretive_translation": "In sequential union, Ambashtha and Ugra are born as prescribed; similarly, Kshatriya and Vaideha offspring arise even in inverse union.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority flows through divine order, not biological lineage alone",
    "Causation aligns with sequential manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness, not birth",
    "Restoration logic upholds dharma-vyavastha without punitive distortion",
    "Consciousness alignment determines social role, not caste-by-birth"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF lineage claim contradicts consciousness capacity THEN social role shall be reassigned via spiritual assessment",
    "IF sequential union results in progeny THEN validate against dharma-siddhanta ELSE initiate realignment process",
    "IF inverse union occurs AND offspring demonstrates kshatra-tejas THEN recognize as kshatriya ELSE assign swadharma accordingly",
    "IF societal disruption arises from varna-mixing THEN restore balance through consciousness elevation protocols",
    "IF individual exhibits innate leadership THEN grant kshatra-dharma regardless of parentage"

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality follows sequential unfoldment. Birth does not determine dharma-role; consciousness does. Thus, inverse unions producing capable heirs do not incur penalty but require integration. Responsibility is proportional to awareness, not lineage.",

  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma is restored through consciousness recognition, not punitive hierarchy. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
