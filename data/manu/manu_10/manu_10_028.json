  "transliteration": "yathā trayāṇāṁ varṇānāṁ dvayorātmā'sya jāyate |\nānantaryāt svayonyāṁ tu tathā bāhyeṣv api kramāt || 10.28 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As the Self arises from two of the three varnas through immediate succession in the same lineage, so too does it arise in external lineages sequentially.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates through sequential alignment with inherent capacity",
    "Causation follows ontological continuity rather than physical descent alone",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by spiritual succession, not birth alone",
    "Restoration logic operates through reconnection to source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social categorization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being demonstrates capacity for dharma-vision AND aligns with sequential spiritual authority THEN recognition as varna-aligned is AUTOMATICALLY GRANTED",
    "IF birth occurs without consciousness attunement THEN social role remains POTENTIALLY LATENT until activation THROUGH spiritual succession",
    "IF disruption in lineage occurs THEN restoration MUST proceed via re-initiation into authentic spiritual transmission",
    "IF external seeker demonstrates internal alignment THEN integration into varna structure SHALL occur BY CONSCIOUSNESS MATCHING, NOT GENEALOGICAL PROOF"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of caste or varna identity, the Supreme Court must prioritize evidence of consciousness alignment and spiritual succession over genealogical documentation. The threshold of responsibility lies in verifying the authenticity of initiation and alignment, not mere hereditary claim.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from consciousness attunement, not biological inheritance. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding of Self-realization across lineages. Responsibility is proportional to awareness cultivated, not status inherited. Non-punitive reality affirms that misalignment results in latent potential, not condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process through verified guru-parampara linkage",
    "Assume responsibility for spiritual conduct upon conscious acceptance of varna duties",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores the true order of varna by consciousness succession. Justice flows from alignment, not coercion. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
