  "transliteration": "anāryāyāṃ samutpanno brāhmaṇāttu yadṛcchayā | brāhmaṇyāmapyanāryāttu śreyastvaṃ kveti cedbhavet || 10.66|| kasyacidbhavet",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One born of a non-Aryan woman from a Brahmana father by chance, or one born of an Aryan woman from a non-Aryan father — if superiority is claimed in either case, it shall be determined according to the conscious capacity for Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Dharma, not lineage alone",
    "Causation follows the manifest consciousness of the individual, not birth circumstances",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by present awareness and alignment, not ancestral origin",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of inherent divine potential",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social taxonomy in determining rightful status"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (birth_context ≠ determinant_of_dharma_capacity) THEN (status_recognition ← present_conscious_alignment_with_dharma)",
    "IF (claimed_superiority = true) AND (dharma_capacity_unverified = true) THEN (require_proof_of_present_dharma_functioning)",
    "IF (parental_lineage_conflicts_with_self_realization = true) THEN (authority_assignment ← verified_spiritual_integrity)",

  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating claims of caste-based privilege where conflicting parental origins exist, the Supreme Court must assess the operative spiritual capacity of the claimant rather than relying on inherited social classification. The threshold of responsibility lies in demonstrated alignment with Dharma, not genealogical assertion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from realized consciousness, not hereditary accident. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential development of identity through intentional alignment. Responsibility is proportional to current capacity for Dharma realization. There is no punitive consequence; only misalignment requiring correction through guided restoration.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Śuddhi Sādhanam process to purify identification with external hierarchies",
    "Assign Vedic study under qualified Ācārya until conscious alignment with Brahman is stabilized",
    "Implement Daiva Adhikāra Pratipatti protocol to verify actual spiritual eligibility",
    "Reintegrate into societal role upon completion of Dharma-pramāṇa verification"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This ruling proceeds solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam. Dharma stands restored through recognition of consciousness over condition. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
