  "transliteration": "vaiśyaṁ prati tathaivaite nivarteranniti sthitiḥ |\nna tau prati hi tān dharmān manurāha prajāpatiḥ || 10.78 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The same duties applicable to Vaishyas also apply to those who engage in agriculture and trade for sustenance; however, these specific duties were not declared by Manu for the twice-born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from functional role within societal dharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation aligns with occupational engagement and economic activity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by active participation in varna-specific functions",
    "Restoration logic emphasizes realignment with inherent svadharma through occupation",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when one operates within designated societal function"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an individual engages in agricultural or trading activities AS THEIR PRIMARY SUSTAINING FUNCTION THEN assign Vaishya-level dharmic obligations",
    "IF a person's actions align with Vaishya-functional duties REGARDLESS OF BIRTH, THEN apply corresponding jurisprudential frameworks",
    "IF no explicit dharmic framework exists for a class, THEN default to closest functional equivalence based on pramana",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication involving disputes over caste-based rights or occupational entitlements, the threshold of responsibility lies in determining functional engagement rather than hereditary claim. Authority flows from sustained performance of varna-karma. The court must prioritize restoration of correct occupational alignment over punitive measures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana establishes that dharma follows function, not lineage where function diverges. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential manifestation of duty based on engaged action. Proportional responsibility arises from degree of deviation from svadharma. Non-punitive reality rule confirms correction through reintegration into rightful occupational flow.",
