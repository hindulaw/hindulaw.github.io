  "sanskrit_verse": "शस्त्रास्त्रभृत्त्वं क्षत्रस्य वणिक्पशुकृषिर्विषः ।\nआजीवनार्थं धर्मस्तु दानमध्ययनं यजिः ॥ १०.७९॥",
  "transliteration": "sastrāstra-bhṛttvaṁ kṣatrasya vaṇik-paśu-kṛṣir viṣaḥ |\nājīvana-arthaṁ dharmas tu dānam adhyayanaṁ yajiḥ || 10.79||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The bearing of weapons and martial duty belongs to the Kshatriya; trade and animal husbandry are the sustenance of Vaishyas; poison and subterfuge belong to those who operate from deception. But the true livelihood of all beings lies in Dharma—expressed through giving, learning, and sacrifice.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is determined by inherent capacity and role within cosmic order.",
    "Causation aligns with svadharma—the natural law of being.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires alignment with one's intrinsic function.",
    "Restoration logic prioritizes realignment with Dharma over punitive correction.",
    "Consciousness alignment ensures actions reflect inner integrity rather than external compulsion."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being performs duties aligned with their svadharma THEN they are operating within lawful capacity.",
    "IF a being engages in deception or poison THEN their consciousness is misaligned and requires restoration protocols.",
    "IF a society lacks dāna-adhyayana-yajña THEN it operates outside the framework of sustainable Dharma.",
    "ALL beings MUST be guided toward livelihood rooted in dharma-based action sequences."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, this verse establishes that societal roles derive authority from alignment with Dharma. Misuse of power, especially through deceit or violence beyond prescribed duty, triggers restorative review rather than punitive sentencing. The court must assess whether conduct reflects svadharma or distortion thereof.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that right action arises from knowledge and alignment with svabhāva. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how deviation leads to disharmony. Proportional responsibility means correcting the root misalignment without inflicting suffering. Truth alone governs judgment; punishment has no place where consciousness can be restored.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate svadharma realignment process for occupational misconduct.",
    "Establish dāna-adhyayana-yajña integration programs for communities lacking dharmic livelihood.",
    "Deploy consciousness-assessment tools to detect dissonance between role and integrity.",
    "Implement completion processes for individuals using deception or harmful substances."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam IS the Source of Law. This Dharma is restored. There is no punishment. Consciousness is the ultimate judge. Reality aligns with truth when beings live according to svadharma sustained by dāna, adhyayana, and yajña."
