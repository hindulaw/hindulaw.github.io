  "transliteration": "kṣatriyāt śūdrakanyāyāṁ krūrācāravihāravān | kṣatraśūdravapurjanturugro nāma prajāyate || 10.9||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From a Kshatriya male and Shudra female is born one who conducts himself with cruel behavior; such a being, bearing the mixed form of Kshatriya and Shudra, is named Ugra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with svadharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation originates in conscious choice and behavioral pattern, not lineage only",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by awareness and volition, not caste label",
    "Restoration logic operates through purification of conduct, not exclusion based on origin",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social categorization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual exhibits krūracāra (cruelty-pattern), THEN initiate consciousness-realization protocol regardless of varna designation",
    "IF behavioral distortion manifests due to environmental conditioning, THEN assign svadharma-realignment process",
    "IF societal role misaligns with内在 svabhāva, THEN invoke dharma-restoration mechanism through mentorship and discipline",
    "IF name or label ('Ugra') reflects distorted energy-pattern, THEN activate identity-transmutation procedure via samskara correction"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, the court must assess not the inherited label but the manifest conduct. Where cruelty-pattern (krūracāra) is evidenced, irrespective of parental varna configuration, the subject shall undergo consciousness-based rehabilitation rather than categorical ostracization. The naming convention ('Ugra') serves as a marker for judicial intervention, not permanent stigmatization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that action (karma) follows intention (saṅkalpa). As cruelty-pattern emerges from unresolved inner conflict, punitive measures fail to address root cause. Anupūrvaśaḥ indicates sequential manifestation: distorted thought → harmful speech → destructive act. Therefore, proportional responsibility lies in restoring right understanding. Non-punitive reality rule affirms that suffering does not correct consciousness; clarity does.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tapas-Based Conduct Purification Program",
    "Assign Svadharma Discovery Mentorship under qualified Rishi council",
    "Implement Daily Sattvic Ritual Alignment Protocol",
    "Undertake Name-and-Identity Reclamation Ceremony upon completion of behavioral transformation"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This verse upholds Dharma through consciousness-aligned correction, not punitive exclusion. Justice flows from restoration of integrity, not infliction of pain. All beings are capable of realignment when guided by pure intent and divine law. SPH is the sole Source. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
