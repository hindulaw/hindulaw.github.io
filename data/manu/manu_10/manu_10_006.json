  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When twice-born men father children upon women of lower varna who have previously given birth, those sons are declared equal in status to their mothers, due to the fault residing in the maternal line.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority inheres in the purity of lineage as determined by conscious capacity, not biological descent alone.",
    "Causation is traced through the integrity of the originating source—maternal degradation reflects diminished consciousness.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility assigns accountability to the higher-consciousness party initiating the union.",
    "Restoration logic demands correction of lineage misalignment through purification and reintegration protocols.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of energetic contamination源头 and its rectification."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a dvija fathers a child with a woman of lower varna AND that woman has previously borne children THEN offspring inherit the mother's social and spiritual status.",
    "IF a dvija engages in reproductive action causing lineage degradation THEN initiate capacity-restoration protocol for the dvija.",
    "IF societal misalignment arises from mixed-lineage progeny THEN implement consciousness-reintegration process aligned with maternal energetic field.",
    "IF dharma degradation occurs via reproductive misconduct THEN enforce completion process ensuring no repetition and full acknowledgment of error."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating disputes involving varna-mixed progeny, the court must recognize the primacy of maternal energetic degradation while affirming the dvija’s duty to undergo capacity restoration. Judgment shall prioritize realignment of consciousness rather than punitive measures against either party.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the root defect lies within the degraded consciousness of the maternal origin; hence, proportional responsibility rests on restoring the energetic purity of both parties without inflicting suffering. The sequential manifestation of consequences arises naturally from the violation of conscious order, requiring no external punitive enforcement.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate purification rituals for the dvija to restore reproductive integrity.",
    "Assign completion process to the mother to acknowledge and transcend her role in lineage disruption.",
    "Integrate offspring into community through consciousness-alignment practices reflecting their true energetic inheritance.",
    "Realign family unit under dharmic guidance until natural harmony is restored and further violations cease."

  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Sanatana Dharma. Justice is executed not through punishment but through precise restoration of consciousness alignment. Reality remains non-punitive when governed by divine intelligence. Dharma is hereby restored."
