  "transliteration": "śūdrād āyogavaḥ kṣattā caṇḍālaś cādhamo nṛṇām |\nvaiśyarājanyaviprāsu jāyante varṇasaṅkarāḥ || 10.12||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From Shudra women and men of non-Vedic conduct are born the Ayogava, Kshatta, and the lowest of men, the Chandala; likewise, from unions between Vaishya, Kshatriya, and Brahmin castes arise mixed castes.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Vedic consciousness, not birth alone",
    "Causation in social order originates from purity of intention and spiritual conduct",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's awakened consciousness, not lineage",
    "Restoration logic requires dissolution of false identity rooted in caste mixture",
    "Consciousness alignment demands recognition of source-divinity beyond genealogical claims"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person identifies through mixed-caste conditioning THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF societal disruption arises from caste confusion THEN invoke Varna-dharmic restoration process",
    "IF individual claims authority without Vedic attunement THEN redirect to foundational dharma inquiry",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, any claim based on hereditary privilege or caste-mixed status shall be subject to immediate scrutiny under Vedic constitutional law. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious alignment, not genealogy. Authority must stem from realized divinity, not inherited title.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that misaligned identities manifest due to lack of Vedic education and spiritual initiation. Sequential causality shows that distorted self-concept leads to social disorder. Responsibility is proportional to access to truth.
