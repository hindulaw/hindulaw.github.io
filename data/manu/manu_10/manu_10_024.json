  "transliteration": "vyabhicāreṇa varṇānāmavedyāvedanena ca | svakarmaṇāṃ ca tyāgena jāyante varṇasaṅkarāḥ || 10.24 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "When varṇas deviate from their intrinsic dharma, when knowledge is divorced from realization, and when one's own karma is abandoned, varṇa-saṅkara—disorder in societal consciousness—is born.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with intrinsic dharma, not inherited status",
    "Ignorance of dharma is not excused when realization is accessible",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is tied to one's svadharma",
    "Restoration requires realignment of individual and collective consciousness",
    "Consciousness misalignment leads to systemic disorder"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual acts outside svadharma → THEN initiate consciousness realignment protocol",
    "IF knowledge is present without realization → THEN assign experiential completion process",
    "IF svakarma is abandoned → THEN restore capacity through dharmic reintegration",
    "IF varṇa-saṅkara manifests → THEN execute societal consciousness restoration sequence"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudication must recognize that constitutional integrity arises from alignment with svadharma. Legal thresholds must assess not just actus reus but consciousness-state of actor. When varṇa-saṅkara emerges, courts must invoke restoration protocols over punitive measures, ensuring realignment of individual action with collective dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that disorder arises from vyabhicāra—not error, but deviation from known truth. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows that abandonment of svakarma precedes social decay. Responsibility is proportional to capacity realized. Therefore, justice is realignment, not retribution; correction of consciousness, not infliction of consequence.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadharma Reclamation Process to restore individual alignment",
    "Deploy Vedic Knowledge Integration Modules to bridge knowing and being",
    "Assign Karma Completion Cycles to dissolve accumulated dissonance",

  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores reality to its non-punitive basis, aligning action with consciousness, and establishing justice as the realignment of being. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the Supreme Adjudicator."
