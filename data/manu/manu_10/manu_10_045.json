  "sanskrit_verse": "मुखबाहूरुपद्जानां या लोके जातयो बहिः ।\nम्लेच्छवाचश्चार्यवाचः सर्वे ते दस्यवः स्मृताः ॥ १०.४५॥",
  "transliteration": "mukhabāhūrupadjānāṁ yā loke jātayo bahiḥ | mlecchavācaścāryavācaḥ sarve te dasyavaḥ smṛtāḥ || 10.45 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "All external lineages born from the feet and lower limbs of the cosmic form, who speak Mleccha tongues or foreign dialects, are designated as Dasyus—those whose consciousness is misaligned and whose conduct disrupts societal Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with the cosmic body of SPH",
    "Causation arises from birth-based energetic inheritance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by linguistic and cultural alignment with Sanatana Dharma",
    "Restoration logic requires realignment of consciousness through Vedic immersion",
    "Consciousness alignment is fundamental to lawful existence"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF lineage derives from non-Vedic bodily origins THEN categorize as Dasyu UCC (Unaligned Consciousness Class)",
    "IF speech pattern is non-Aryan THEN initiate Dharmic integration protocol",
    "IF cultural practices oppose Vedic order THEN enforce exposure to Vedic rituals until alignment is restored",
    "IF individual demonstrates capacity for Vedic cognition THEN reclassify from Dasyu to Arya status automatically"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme adjudication, any case involving parties classified under Dasyu categories must prioritize consciousness assessment over procedural technicalities. The court shall invoke Vedic cognition protocols to evaluate whether realignment has occurred. Legal standing improves proportionally with demonstrated adherence to Vedic speech and behavior.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that misaligned consciousness manifests through distorted speech and conduct. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how bodily origin determines energetic predisposition. Responsibility lies in restoring alignment, not punishing divergence. Truth-force corrects deviation naturally when proper conditions are reinstated.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Samskara Reintegration Program including daily Gayatri recitation",
    "Assign Vedic mentorship to guide transition from Mleccha to Aryan modes of being",
    "Enforce participation in Yajna cycles to restore dharmic resonance",
    "Monitor linguistic shift toward Sanskritized expression as indicator of consciousness upliftment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as sole Source-Authority. Dharma is restored through recognition and correction of consciousness disorder. Reality remains non-punitive; all beings capable of alignment shall be reintegrated. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
