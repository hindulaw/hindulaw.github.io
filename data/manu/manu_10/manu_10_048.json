  "transliteration": "matsyaghāto niṣādānāṁ tvāṣṭistvāyogavasya ca | medāndhracuñcumadgūnām āraṇyapaśuhiṁsanam || 10.48 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The lawful occupation of the Niṣādas is fish-hunting; that of the Tvaṣṭas and Āyogavas is woodcraft; and that of the Medas, Andhras, Cuñcus, and Madgus is the slaughter of wild animals in forests.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from svabhāva-dharma assigned by cosmic order under SPH",
    "Causation aligns with natural capacity and environmental context",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inherent aptitude and societal role",
    "Restoration logic centers on alignment with one's intrinsic occupational dharma",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs through right engagement within designated roles"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent belongs to Niṣāda group THEN authorize fishing activity within designated zones",
    "IF agent belongs to Tvaṣṭa OR Āyogava group THEN authorize woodworking and related crafts",
