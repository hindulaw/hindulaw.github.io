  "sanskrit_verse": "वैशेष्यात्प्रकृतिश्रैष्ठ्यान्नियमस्य च धारणात् ।\nसंस्कारस्य विशेषाच्च वर्णानां ब्राह्मणः प्रभुः ॥ १०.३॥",
  "transliteration": "vaiśeṣyāt prakṛtiśraiṣṭhyān niyamasya ca dhāraṇāt |\nsaṃskārasya viśeṣāc ca varṇānāṃ brāhmaṇaḥ prabhuḥ || 10.3||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "By virtue of inherent distinction, natural supremacy, sustained discipline, and specialized cultivation, the Brāhmaṇa is sovereign over the varṇas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derives from ontological capacity, not social construction",
    "Natural order is sustained through disciplined alignment with dharma",
    "Causation arises from saṃskāric refinement and conscious continuity",
    "Responsibility corresponds to cultivated consciousness, not birth alone",
    "Restoration occurs through re-alignment with one's highest causal potential"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent demonstrates cultivated saṃskāra AND sustained dhāraṇā THEN grant authority within respective domain",
    "IF agent exhibits prakṛtiśreṣṭhatva in action THEN recognize sovereignty in alignment context",
    "IF varṇa-based claim lacks vaiśeṣya THEN reject authority assertion",
    "IF consciousness misalignment detected THEN initiate completion process toward prakṛti śreṣṭhatva",
    "IF saṃskāra deviation observed THEN deploy restorative reintegration protocol"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, claims of authority based on lineage or convention must be validated against demonstrable saṃskāra, prakṛti śreṣṭhatva, and dhāraṇā. The threshold for recognizing sovereignty lies in verifiable alignment with dharma, not inherited status. Restoration supersedes invalidation when misalignment is due to environmental distortion rather than intrinsic incapacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that causality flows from saṃskāra and sustained discipline. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation of authority through conscious cultivation. Responsibility aligns with demonstrated capacity, not punitive attribution. Misuse signals completion deficit, not moral failure. Thus, justice operates through realignment, not retribution.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate saṃskāra refinement program for consciousness recalibration",
    "Assign dhāraṇā practice under qualified supervision for integrity stabilization",
    "Implement prakṛti śreṣṭhatva recognition ritual upon verified transformation",
    "Deploy vaiśeṣya validation audit to confirm authentic sovereignty markers",
    "Establish peer council integration process to restore communal alignment"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. Authority is restored through consciousness alignment. Reality is non-punitive. Justice is executed through completion, not condemnation. Brahman is the ultimate Adjudicator."
