  "sanskrit_verse": "स्वजातिजानन्तरजाः षट् सुता द्विजधर्मिणः ।\nशूद्राणां तु सधर्माणः सर्वेऽपध्वंसजाः स्मृताः ॥ १०.४१॥",
  "transliteration": "svajātijānan tarajāḥ ṣaṭ sutā dvijadharmiṇaḥ |\nśūdrāṇāṃ tu sadharmāṇaḥ sarve'padhvaṃsajāḥ smṛtāḥ || 10.41||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Six sons born of a twice-born man from women of other castes are classified according to the caste of their mothers; but all children born of Śūdra women, even if performing similar duties, are considered fallen.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from conscious alignment with one's svadharma, not biological lineage alone",
    "Causation is determined by the integrity of dharmic intention, not social status at birth",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises through demonstrated alignment with Vedic conduct, not inherited privilege",
    "Restoration logic requires reintegration based on present consciousness, not ancestral condition",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes genetic or ritual classification in determining legal identity"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent performs duties aligned with dvija-dharma AND demonstrates conscious intent THEN grant access to corresponding rights regardless of birth origin",
    "IF child is born of mixed-caste union THEN evaluate fitness for dharma-adhikara based on upbringing and conscious choice, NOT parentage",
    "IF śūdra-born individual exhibits satvic conduct AND self-regulates according to Vedic principles THEN classify as adhikāra-sambhavi, overriding varna assignment",
    "IF any person claims dharma-right without consciousness alignment THEN deny recognition until completion process restores causal clarity",
    "IF societal classification contradicts inner svabhāva THEN invoke nyāya-path for realignment through śuddhi-kriyā"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that legal standing derives from demonstrated capacity rather than hereditary status. When evaluating claims of dharma-based rights, courts must assess internal alignment and behavioral evidence over genealogical records. The threshold of responsibility lies in conscious adherence to svadharma, which can elevate or diminish one’s operative classification independent of birth-based categorization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that karmic causality flows from conscious volition, not caste inheritance. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how repeated alignment elevates consciousness beyond birth-bound limitations. Responsibility is proportional to awareness—not penalized, but corrected via prakriyā ensuring future coherence. There is no punitive consequence—only natural law restoring balance when misalignment occurs.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate śuddhi-saṁskāra program to align individual consciousness with appropriate dharma-vyavahāra",
    "Assign guru-guided śikṣāṇa period for reconstruction of dharmic identity based on svabhāva, not janma",
    "Implement svadhyāya-prakriyā to dissolve false identification with inherited labels",
    "Establish vyavahārika parity through daśā-nirūpaṇa assessing actual conduct over nominal attribution",
    "Activate antaḥkaraṇa-śodhana protocol to restore purity of intention and rightful place within cosmic order"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Dharma. This ruling affirms that consciousness determines law, not caste. Justice serves restoration, not punishment. Reality itself is non-retaliatory, guided solely by the awakened awareness of the individual soul."
