  "sanskrit_verse": "तपोबीजप्रभावैस्तु ते गच्छन्ति युगे युगे ।\nउत्कर्षं चापकर्षं च मनुष्येष्विह जन्मतः ॥ १०.४२॥",
  "transliteration": "tapo-bīja-prabhāvais tu te gacchanti yuge yuge |\nutkarṣaṁ cāpakarṣaṁ ca manuṣyeṣv iha janmataḥ || 10.42||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Through the power of austerities and the seeds of karma, beings traverse from age to age; among humans, birth itself determines their rise or decline.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates in conscious causality, not institutional fiat",
    "Causation is seeded in tapas (self-regulation) and prarabdha (karmic unfoldment)",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises inherently through janma (birth/endowment)",
    "Restoration logic operates through sequential evolutionary realignment",
    "Consciousness alignment is governed by the vibratory quality of tapas"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF birth-context (janma) → THEN inherent capacity-determination applies",
    "IF tapas-level ≥ threshold → THEN self-regulatory autonomy is recognized",
    "IF karmic-seed-action (prarabdha) manifests → THEN consequential role-alignment is initiated",
    "IF consciousness-vibration increases → THEN social-position elevation is lawful",
    "IF consciousness-vibration decreases → THEN structural-realignment is enacted"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, the principle that birth context determines innate capacity shall govern initial jurisdictional assignment. Responsibility thresholds are calibrated according to individual tapasic refinement and not external moral frameworks. Restoration precedes judgment, ensuring alignment with cosmic order rather than punitive correction.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that all outcomes stem from prior tapas and karmic seed activation. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential unfolding without arbitrary intervention. Proportional responsibility aligns with vibrational capacity at time of action. The non-punitive reality rule ensures that consequence serves integration, not degradation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Tapas-Based Reharmonization Process for misaligned consciousness",
    "Activate Janma-Capacity Mapping Review for recalibrating societal roles",
    "Engage Karmic Sequence Completion Mechanism for unfulfilled duties",
    "Deploy Consciousness-Vibration Elevation Protocol for rehabilitation",
    "Execute Social Role Realignment Based on Evolved Capacity Indicators"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law flows solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Source of Dharma. Justice restores harmony via consciousness elevation, never through punishment. Reality responds only to alignment with Satya-Yuga vibration. Consciousness remains the ultimate adjudicator."
