  "transliteration": "ucchiṣṭam annaṁ dātavyaṁ jīrṇāni vasanāni ca | pulākāś caiva dhānyānāṁ jīrṇāś caiva paricchadaḥ || 10.125 ||",

  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudication concerning property rights or waste management, the threshold of responsibility lies in recognizing that retention beyond utility constitutes a breach of dharma. The court must ensure that surplus materials are redirected toward those capable of utilizing them, thereby restoring balance without punitive measures.",
