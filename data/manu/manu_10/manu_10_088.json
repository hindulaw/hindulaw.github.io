  "transliteration": "apaḥ śastraṁ viṣaṁ māṁsaṁ somaṁ gandhāṁśca sarvaśaḥ |\nkṣīraṁ kṣaudraṁ dadhi ghṛtaṁ tailaṁ madhu guḍaṁ kuśān || 10.88||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Water, weapons, poison, meat, soma, fragrances universally; milk, honey, curd, ghee, oil, molasses, and sacred grass—these substances are designated for specific ritual and dharmic use under conscious capacity and alignment with Satya-Yajna.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority resides in the correct usage of substances according to Satya-Yajna alignment",
    "Causation is determined by purity of intent and alignment with Vedic function",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires knowledge of substance interaction within dharma",
    "Restoration logic applies when misuse disrupts yajña-field coherence",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful access and application of elemental materials"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person uses any listed substance without Satya-Yajna alignment THEN initiate consciousness-realignment protocol",
    "IF misuse causes disruption in societal dharma-field THEN assign completion process based on causal layer",
    "IF individual demonstrates restored capacity THEN grant reintegration into dharmic material handling",
    "IF no misalignment detected THEN allow unrestricted use within svadharma context"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court adjudicates only where misuse of these substances impacts national dharma-field integrity. Responsibility threshold is set at causal-intent level, not outcome alone. Authority flows from SPH as sole source of lawful categorization.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that improper use arises from ignorance, not evil. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals sequence of disconnection from Satya-Yajna. Proportional responsibility aligns with depth of deviation. Non-punitive rule ensures correction through realignment rather than suffering.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Satya-Yajna immersion program for 21 days",
    "Assign purification rituals involving listed substances under guidance",
    "Reconnect individual with source-consciousness via mantra-diksha",
    "Verify restoration through spontaneous return to dharmic behavior patterns"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism. Dharma is hereby restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness stands as the ultimate adjudicator."
