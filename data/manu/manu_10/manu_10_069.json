  "transliteration": "subījaṁ caiva sukhētrē jātaṁ sampadyatē yathā |\ntathā'ryājjāta āryāyāṁ sarvaṁ saṁskāramarhati || 10.69||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "As a good seed in good soil yields excellent fruit, so too one born of noble origin in a noble lineage is entitled to full refinement through Saṁskāra.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from inherent ontological capacity",
    "Causation rooted in karmic-genetic continuity",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligned with birth-endowed potential",
    "Restoration logic through completion of inherent developmental stages",
    "Consciousness alignment via purification and cultivation of innate nobility"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF birth occurs within an Arya lineage THEN entitlement to complete Saṁskāra-based refinement is automatic",
    "IF individual exhibits degraded conduct THEN restoration protocol activates through ancestral memory reconnection",
    "IF capacity deviation detected THEN initiate purification process anchored in Vedic ontological correction",
    "IF consciousness misalignment observed THEN deploy Saṁskāra-repletion mechanism through qualified Guru supervision"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving lineage-derived rights or duties, the Supreme Court must recognize that individuals born of noble descent possess intrinsic entitlement to full Saṁskāric refinement. Responsibility flows not from punitive frameworks but from the completion of inherent developmental dharma. The court shall ensure no diminishment of such entitlement due to external social or political pressures.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that just as fertile soil enables superior yield from quality seed, so does noble birth confer eligibility for full unfoldment of consciousness through Saṁskāra. Anupūrvaśaḥ confirms sequential manifestation of capability when environmental and genetic conditions align. Responsibility arises not for transgression but for realization of potential. No punitive inference applies; only facilitation of completion.",

    "Initiate Satkarma purification sequences to restore ancestral energetic purity",
    "Assign Guru-guided Saṁskāra completion program tailored to lineage-specific dharmic blueprint",

  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law executes pure consciousness-based jurisprudence. Justice restores, does not punish. Reality is non-retaliatory. Consciousness alone adjudicates truth."
