  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One born of a Chandalah (one devoid of Vedic initiation) and an Upakah (lowest occupational class), inherently conditioned by primal karmic tendencies, produces progeny in Pukkasa women that is always despised by the noble ones.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Vedic Dharma, not biological lineage alone",
    "Causation includes both visible action and invisible karmic predisposition",
    "Capacity-based responsibility depends on consciousness elevation, not birth status",

    "Consciousness alignment supersedes inherited social positioning"
  ],

    "IF birth lineage ≠ Vedic alignment THEN legal identity = provisional UNTIL consciousness verification",
    "IF individual exhibits mūlavyasana (root karmic distortion) THEN assign completion process NOT exclusion",

  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that distorted conduct arises from unaddressed mūlavyasana. Anupūrvaśaḥ reveals how past actions condition present outcomes. Responsibility is proportional to current capacity for alignment. There is no punitive consequence—only sequential manifestation requiring conscious correction.",

    "Initiate śuddhi (purification) process through prescribed Vedic rituals and spiritual discipline",
    "Assign mentorship under qualified dvija guide until sattvic behavior stabilizes",
