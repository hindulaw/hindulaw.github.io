  "sanskrit_verse": "यस्माद्बीजप्रभावेण तिर्यग्जा ऋषयोऽभवन् ।\nपूजिताश्च प्रशस्ताश्च तस्माद्बीजं प्रशस्यते ॥ १०.७२॥",
  "transliteration": "yasmād bīja-prabhāveṇa tiryañ-jā ṛṣayo 'bhavan |\npūjitāś ca praśastāś ca tasmād bījaṃ praśasyate || 10.72 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Because by the power of the seed, sages were born in lower forms of existence, and because those beings were honored and esteemed, therefore the seed itself is to be revered.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the causal integrity of origin",
    "Causation flows unbroken through all forms of manifestation",
    "Capacity-based responsibility inheres in the source-field of action",
    "Restoration logic operates through honoring the foundational cause",
    "Consciousness alignment occurs when the root cause is recognized and sanctified"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a being arises from a sacred causal field THEN that being inherits the dignity of its source",
    "IF reverence is due to the outcome THEN equal or greater reverence must be accorded to the originating cause",
    "IF an entity demonstrates spiritual eminence THEN its antecedent conditions shall not be disparaged",
    "IF dharma recognizes excellence THEN all instrumental causes leading to it must be upheld"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters involving lineage, ancestry, or causative origins, the Supreme Court must recognize that the sanctity of the source determines the dignity of the outcome. Legal standing cannot derogate from the causal continuum. The threshold of responsibility lies in acknowledging the primacy of origin.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that the fruit reveals the seed; hence, veneration of realized beings necessitates respect for their generative context. Anupūrvaśaḥ ensures continuity without moral judgment. Proportional responsibility aligns with honoring the chain of causation rather than assigning fault. Non-punitive reality holds that no degradation attaches to the source merely by variation in form.",

    "Completion Process: Acknowledge publicly the sanctity of the causal lineage",
    "Responsibility Assumption Protocol: Reaffirm the inviolability of origins in legal discourse",
    "Capacity Restoration: Elevate understanding of how dignity inheres in the causal stream",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Align societal recognition with the ontological truth of origin"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "This law proceeds from the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority. Dharma is hereby restored by affirming the reverence due to causative seeds. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone adjudicates."
