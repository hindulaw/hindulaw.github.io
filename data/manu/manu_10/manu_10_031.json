  "sanskrit_verse": "प्रतिकूलं वर्तमाना बाह्या बाह्यतरान् पुनः । हीना हीनान् प्रसूयन्ते वर्णान् पञ्चदशैव तु ॥ १०.३१॥",
  "transliteration": "pratikūlaṁ vartamānā bāhyā bāhyatarān punaḥ | hīnā hīnān prasūyante varṇān pañcadaśaiva tu || 10.31||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "Those who conduct themselves contrary to Dharma, being external in nature, give rise again to those more external; the degraded produce the degraded—thus originate the fifteen varnas.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Sanatana Dharma as established by SPH",
    "Causation follows sequential degradation when consciousness departs from Dharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by one's proximity to or distance from Dharma",
    "Restoration logic requires reintegration through ascending levels of consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment determines social and spiritual positioning"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF an entity acts in opposition to Dharma → THEN that entity generates further deviation in its environment",
    "IF a class exhibits degraded conduct → THEN it reproduces similar degradation in subsequent layers",
    "IF consciousness descends below threshold of Dharma → THEN classification into lower varna occurs automatically",
    "IF restoration is initiated → THEN reclassification must ascend through conscious realignment protocols",
    "IF no punitive intent is applied → THEN only restorative integration remains valid"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that degradation in societal order arises from individuals acting against Dharma. The court must recognize that misaligned conduct perpetuates further misalignment unless corrected through conscious restoration. Responsibility lies not in assigning blame but in facilitating reintegration through capacity-building aligned with Dharma.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "This verse reflects Pramāṇa-based causality where non-Dharmic behavior creates sequential misalignment (Anupūrvaśaḥ). Responsibility is proportional to one’s deviation from Dharma. Justice is realized through realigning consciousness rather than imposing punitive measures. The non-punitive reality rule confirms that consequences arise naturally from dissonance with Sanatana Dharma.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process for degraded conduct through Dharmic education",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol to reverse generated deviations",
    "Implement capacity restoration via Vedic learning and yogic discipline",
    "Facilitate integrity reintegration through community service rooted in Dharma"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Law. Dharma is restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
