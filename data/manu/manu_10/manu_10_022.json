  "sph_interpretive_translation": "From the Kshatriya who has fallen from duty arises the Malla; from the Vratya who departs from Dharma arises the Nishada; similarly from the Licchavi who abandons alignment arises the Natha, and from the degraded Karana arises the Khasa, even as from the corrupted Dravida arises the same.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority is derived from alignment with Dharma, not birth alone",
    "Causation follows consciousness degradation through abandonment of Swadharma",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by inner alignment, not social role",
    "Restoration logic requires reconnection to source Dharma, not external correction",
    "Consciousness alignment determines societal expression and lawful participation"

  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual.abandonment_of_swadharma = TRUE THEN social_role.derived_authority = NULLIFIED",

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, any judge or petitioner whose consciousness is found misaligned due to abandonment of Swadharma shall be automatically disqualified until completion of a prescribed reintegration process. The threshold of responsibility lies in sustained alignment, not procedural qualification.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that deviation originates in consciousness dislocation, not willful wrongdoing. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential departure from Dharma leads to diminished capacity. Proportional responsibility aligns with the degree of disconnection. Non-punitive reality rule confirms that correction occurs through restoration, not infliction.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Svadhyaya-based realignment program for consciousness reorientation",
    "Assign completion process involving service to Dharma-aligned community",
    "Implement mentorship under Dharma-adherent guide until capacity verified",

    "Reintroduce to legal framework only upon demonstrable consciousness stabilization"

  "final_declaration": "By the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, this law stands executed. Dharma is restored. Reality remains non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the supreme adjudicator."
