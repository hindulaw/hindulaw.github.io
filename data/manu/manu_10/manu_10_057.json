  "transliteration": "varṇāpetam avijñātaṃ naraṃ kaluṣayonijam |\nāryarūpam ivānāryaṃ karmabhiḥ svair vibhāvayet || 10.57 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One whose varna is unknown or unidentifiable, born of impure origin, yet assuming the form and conduct of an Arya — such a being must be discerned through their own actions.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from alignment with Dharma, not lineage alone",
    "Causation is determined by conscious choice and action",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires self-revealing conduct",
    "Restoration logic demands removal of false identification",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes social categorization"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF individual claims status without demonstrable alignment THEN eligibility for recognition SHALL be suspended UNTIL conduct evidences true capacity",
    "IF identity is asserted without pramāṇa THEN evaluation MUST proceed via observed karma ONLY",
    "IF conduct contradicts claimed status THEN assumption of role IS automatically revoked AND reintegration process INITIATED",
    "IF origin is obscured BUT behavior aligns with Dharma THEN recognition MAY arise independent of birth-based classification"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating matters of identity or entitlement where lineage or caste-based claims are made without supporting evidence, the court shall evaluate solely based on demonstrated conduct and alignment with Dharma. Birth alone does not confer legitimacy; it is the unfolding of consciousness through action that determines rightful position in society.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Through pramāṇa-based observation of action, truth reveals itself naturally. There is no imposition of judgment; rather, misidentification dissolves when confronted with authentic expression. The sequence of manifestation (anupūrvaśaḥ) ensures that what is falsely assumed cannot sustain under scrutiny. Responsibility lies in aligning one's actions with inner reality, not external labels.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate Self-Revelation Process: Require individual to demonstrate alignment between claim and conduct over time",
    "Implement Consciousness Alignment Review: Conduct regular assessment of behavioral integrity against Dharmic principles",
    "Activate Role Reassessment Protocol: If discrepancy found, suspend role until restoration of congruence occurs",
    "Facilitate Identity Clarification Ceremony: Public acknowledgment and realignment of personal dharma as revealed through action"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: Dharma is restored through action, not assertion. Reality adjudicates beyond birth, beyond label — only consciousness revealed through karma is law. This is non-punitive, ever-restoring, eternally aligned with Satyam."
