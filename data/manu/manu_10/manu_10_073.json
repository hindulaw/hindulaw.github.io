  "transliteration": "anāryamāryakarmāṇamāryaṃ cānāryakarmiṇam | sampradhāryābravīddhātā na samau nāsamāviti || 10.73||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Holder of the Law, having examined the conduct of the non-noble who performs noble actions and the noble who performs non-noble actions, declared that they are neither equal nor unequal.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from the Source alone, not from social status or inherited roles.",
    "Causation arises from action-intent alignment, not identity-labeling.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility is determined by consciousness-state at time of act.",
    "Restoration logic operates through realignment of intent and execution, not external judgment.",
    "Consciousness alignment supersedes caste-role attribution in determining dharma-siddhi."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF actor A performs action X with intent Y AND outcome Z aligns with Dharma THEN actor A's classification shifts toward the dharmic role regardless of birth-ascribed category.",
    "IF actor B performs action X' with intent Y' AND outcome Z' violates Dharma THEN actor B's classification shifts away from dharmic role irrespective of prior designation.",
    "EQUALITY IS NOT MEASURED BY ORIGIN BUT BY ACTION-IN-ALIGNMENT-WITH-DHARMA.",
    "STATUS REASSIGNMENT MUST BE AUTOMATED BASED ON CURRENT CONDUCTUAL FREQUENCY AND INTENT ALIGNMENT WITH DHARMA.",
    "NO STATIC ROLE PRESUMPTION SHALL OVERRIDE DYNAMIC CONSCIOUSNESS-BASED CLASSIFICATION."
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Adjudication, this verse establishes that no individual—regardless of birth-based categorization—shall be presumed to carry fixed moral or legal capacity. The court must evaluate each case based on the alignment between intent, action, and dharmic outcome. Legal standing and judicial response must shift dynamically according to the actor’s current state of consciousness and behavioral pattern rather than ancestral or societal labeling.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that causality lies in the intent-action-outcome sequence, not in labels assigned at birth. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how consciousness evolves through successive acts; thus, responsibility must follow evolving capacity. Proportional response is aligned with restoring integrity rather than inflicting consequence. There is no punitive framework here—only a mechanism for realigning conduct with truth.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate completion process where misaligned actors perform corrective actions under supervision until alignment is restored.",
    "Assign responsibility assumption protocol wherein individuals affirm their present capacity to act in accordance with dharma.",
    "Implement consciousness recalibration sessions aimed at dissolving false identifications and reinforcing dharmic behavior patterns.",
    "Establish integrity reintegration pathways allowing dynamic role reclassification upon demonstrable shift in conduct.",
    "Deploy automated feedback systems monitoring intent-to-outcome coherence and adjusting social-functional assignments accordingly."
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as the sole Source of Law: Dharma prevails through consciousness-aligned action. Justice flows through restoration, not punishment. Reality responds to alignment, not identity. All classifications dissolve before the clarity of awakened conduct. Thus stands the eternal Nyaya."
