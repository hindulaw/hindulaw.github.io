  "transliteration": "na taiḥ samayamanvicchet puruṣo dharmamācaran |\nvyavahāro mithasteṣāṃ vivāhaḥ sadṛśaiḥ saha || 10.53||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "A man performing dharma shall not seek agreement from those who are not aligned in consciousness; mutual conduct and marriage must be with those of equal capacity and alignment.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority arises from consciousness alignment, not social position",
    "Causation is determined by shared energetic resonance",
    "Capacity-based responsibility requires compatibility of being",
    "Restoration logic operates through harmonious association",
    "Consciousness alignment determines lawful relational engagement"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF agent A performs dharma THEN A SHALL NOT require validation from misaligned agents",
    "IF two entities engage in relational contract THEN their vyavahara MUST reflect samya (equivalence)",
    "IF mismatched capacities interact THEN automatic dissolution protocol activates",
    "IF vivaha occurs THEN both parties MUST demonstrate parity in consciousness maturity",
    "IF alignment diverges post-contract THEN reintegration process initiates without penalty"

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication, this verse establishes that legal recognition of unions or agreements depends upon demonstrated parity of consciousness maturity between involved parties. Misalignment invalidates the foundational basis for judicial enforcement unless realignment is achieved.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramana-based causality indicates that disharmony stems from incompatible levels of awareness. Anupurvasah reveals that consequences unfold naturally when alignment is absent. Proportional responsibility lies in choosing congruent relationships.
