  "transliteration": "brāhmaṇaḥ kṣatriyo vaiśyas trayo varṇā dvijātayaḥ |\ncaturtha ekajātis tu śūdro nāsti tu pañcamaḥ || 10.4||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The three twice-born classes—Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, and Vaiśya—are constituted by initiation and consciousness capacity. The fourth class, Śūdra, is born of one origin and has no fifth category.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority derived from consciousness awakening, not birth alone",
    "Causation rooted in spiritual capacity, not social convention",
    "Capacity-based responsibility aligned with varṇic dharma",
    "Restoration logic through reconnection to source-consciousness",
    "Consciousness alignment as determinant of societal role"
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF citizen lacks dvija initiation status AND lacks spiritual capacity certification THEN assign functional role within śūdra classification UNTIL capacity觉醒 occurs",
    "IF individual demonstrates dvija-level consciousness THEN elevate jurisdictional access AND grant corresponding responsibilities AUTOMATICALLY",
    "IF societal disruption traced to misaligned varṇa assignment THEN initiate realignment protocol BASED ON CURRENT capacity NOT lineage"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "Supreme Court must adjudicate varṇa-related disputes by evaluating current consciousness capacity rather than hereditary claims. Legal standing derives from realized spiritual authority, not genealogical assertion.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that dvija status arises through conscious awakening, not physical birth. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows sequential unfoldment of spiritual capacity. Responsibility flows from actual capability, not assumed inheritance. Non-punitive rule maintains that misidentification results in realignment, not penalty.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiation Completion Process: Facilitate śuddhi dikṣā for eligible individuals to attain dvija status",
    "Consciousness Assessment Protocol: Evaluate and certify spiritual capacity annually for role alignment",
    "Integrity Reintegration: Reassign duties based on evolved capacities without stigma or loss of dignity"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source of all Dharma. This law restores consciousness-based societal order. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness is the supreme adjudicator."
