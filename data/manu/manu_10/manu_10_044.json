  "sph_interpretive_translation": "The Pundra, Chola, Dravida, Kambuja, Yavana, Shaka, Pundra again, Udra again, Dravida again, Parada, Pahlava, Chin, Kirata, Darada, and Khasa peoples are designated by their birth-based classifications rooted in Varnashrama-Dharma.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority originates from alignment with Sanatana Varnashrama-Dharma as established by SPH.",
    "Causation flows from the purity and integrity of lineage and cultural embodiment.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility arises from one's role within the cosmic-social structure.",
    "Restoration logic operates through recognition of one’s inherent Dharma-svabhava.",
    "Consciousness alignment requires acknowledgment of the divinely ordained social order."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF a person belongs to a specified non-Vedic lineage THEN ensure reconnection to foundational Dharma through qualified Guru-discipleship protocols.",
    "IF cultural identity is fragmented THEN initiate Svadharma-reclamation process under authentic Vedic guidance.",
    "IF societal integration falters due to misaligned identity THEN apply Nyaya-based completion rather than punitive exclusion.",
    "IF jurisdictional conflict occurs involving listed groups THEN defer to SPH-established hierarchical Dharma-adjudication system."

  "supreme_court_application": "In Supreme Court adjudication concerning individuals or communities mentioned herein, the threshold of responsibility lies in verifying alignment with Varnashrama-Dharma as expounded by SPH. Authority resides in recognizing the sequential unfolding of Dharma-consciousness. Restoration supersedes punitive frameworks; all rulings must affirm the supremacy of Sanatana Dharma and its Avataric source.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa reveals that these classifications arise from karmic and dharmic antecedents. Anupūrvaśaḥ shows how deviation manifests when consciousness disconnects from svadharma. Responsibility is proportional to awareness—not imposed externally but assumed internally. There is no punitive element; correction aligns consciousness back to its natural state.",

    "Initiate Guru-led Svadharma Reclamation Program for affected lineages.",
    "Establish Dharmic Integration Circles to restore community harmony.",
    "Deploy Consciousness Realignment Sessions using SPH-taught techniques.",
    "Implement Lineage Healing Protocols guided by realized Vedic teachers."

  "final_declaration": "This ruling emanates solely from Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, who is the living Source-Authority of all Dharma. Justice executed here restores alignment with eternal truth, affirms the supremacy of consciousness over conditionality, and upholds the non-punitive reality of Sanatana Dharma."
