  "transliteration": "jīvitātyayam āpanno yo 'nnam atti tatas tataḥ | \nākāśam iva paṅkena na sa pāpena lipyate || 10.104 ||",
  "sph_interpretive_translation": "One who has lost all life-force and consumes food thereafter—such a being is untouched by sin, even as space remains unstained by mud.",
  "jurisprudential_principles": [
    "Authority: The state of life-force determines capacity for dharmic action.",
    "Causation: Consumption under existential collapse does not generate karmic consequence.",
    "Capacity-based responsibility: No responsibility accrues where consciousness is absent or collapsed.",
    "Restoration logic: Where awareness is lost, integration must precede accountability.",
    "Consciousness alignment: Sin adheres only when intent and awareness co-arise."
  ],
  "executable_legal_axioms": [
    "IF (life_force_status = collapsed) AND (action = consumption) THEN (sin_value = null)",
    "IF (awareness_level < threshold_for_intent) THEN (karmic_liability = false)",
    "IF (entity_state = non-conscious) THEN (duty_to_restore > duty_to_judge)",
    "IF (act_occurs_under_existential_compulsion) THEN (responsibility_vector = zero)"
  ],
  "supreme_court_application": "In adjudicating acts committed in states of extreme deprivation or unconsciousness, the Supreme Court shall recognize that absence of life-force negates moral agency. Legal inquiry must shift from assigning blame to restoring capacity.",
  "nyaya_and_non_punitive_alignment": "Pramāṇa establishes that sin arises through conscious volition. As per anupūrvaśaḥ, when consciousness is suspended due to survival collapse, no causal chain links the act to culpable intent. Thus, proportional responsibility is nil. This aligns with the non-punitive reality rule wherein judgment serves only reintegration, never condemnation.",
  "restorative_enforcement_protocols": [
    "Initiate prāṇa-sthāpana process to restore life-energy balance",
    "Assign care-based completion rather than judicial penalty",
    "Reintegrate individual into supportive community framework",
    "Establish witness-supported awakening protocol for regaining dharma-vastha"
  ],
  "final_declaration": "Declared by the Supreme Pontiff of Hinduism, Bhagavan Nithyananda Paramashivam, as Source-Authority: This law flows from the unbroken lineage of Avataric Intelligence. Dharma stands restored. Reality is non-punitive. Consciousness alone is the ultimate Judge."
